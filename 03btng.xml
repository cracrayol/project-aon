     <p>Ancient days they were when first the Shianti set foot upon the land that men call Magnamund. Long had they journeyed through the void, homeless wanderers in search of a place to call their own. And so it was that when the Shianti first looked upon the face of the land, their hearts were raised in wonder. They saw a world of nameless mountains, untamed forests and lands both wild and free. Here they chose to cease their wanderings and to devote themselves to the study and appreciation of this new-found land.</p>
     <p>To the delight of the Shianti, the race of man first emerged at this time and they watched his early struggle towards civilization with eager concern. Like gods, the Shianti seemed to the minds of primitive men. Tall and proud, shining with a radiance that spoke of magic and arcane mystery, the Shianti moved among them and with their powers of wizardry, aided man in his development.</p>
     <p>As the centuries passed, man fell to worship of the <!--ERRTAG-RE-7321-->magical<!--/ERRTAG-RE-7321--> Shianti and the power of these wizards grew even stronger. With hungry hearts they sought to unlock the mysteries of knowledge, sending their minds into other planes of existence and strange worlds beyond the sphere of the material plane. Their foresight was now unmatched and the power of their thought was mighty indeed. It was at this time that they created the Moonstone. Woven of the very fabric of the astral plane of Daziarn, this translucent gem was the greatest achievement of Shianti wisdom. It was the binding force of all Shianti magic, containing the combined might of all their wizardry, the sum of all their knowledge. The Golden Age of the Shianti had come and the Moonstone was the instrument of their dominion throughout all Magnamund. Man stood as little more than a shadow, blinded by the shining white light of Shianti glory. But, in creating the Moonstone, the unwritten laws of nature had been transgressed. For the Moonstone, like the Shianti themselves, was something outside of man&apos;s own world; it defied the natural order laid down by the creators of the Earth and disrupted the balance that the gods had designed.</p>
     <p>The Goddess Ishir, High Priestess of the Moon and mother of all men, showed herself to the Shianti and spoke to them of the destiny of man: <quote>The children of this world must claim their inheritance. Their time has come and they must learn to stand alone. They are lost in their worship of you and the day draws ever nearer when they will covet the power of the Moonstone.</quote></p>
     <p>And the Shianti said: <quote>Forgive us, Great Goddess, for we intended no harm. We love mankind even as you do. We have sought to do good and protect your children from harm.</quote></p>
     <p>But Ishir replied, <quote>Of this there can be no doubt, but this world is not your realm. Man must be free to pursue his destiny alone, and you must leave, for you trespass on his domain.</quote></p>
     <p>The Shianti were filled with sorrow. They feared a return to the void and to their lonely wandering, and pleaded with Ishir that she might allow them to remain. Ishir was filled with pity for them. She spoke again, saying, <quote>If you are to remain, you must obey my command. You must take a vow never to interfere with mankind&apos;s fate. As a token of good faith you must lay aside the Moonstone, and return it to the plane where it belongs.</quote></p>
     <p>Solemnly, the Shianti agreed. The vow was sworn before Ishir, and the Moonstone was returned to the Daziarn. The Shianti then moved south to the Isle of Lorn. They encircled their new home with a web of enchantments, magical mists and mage winds to prevent man from ever finding their place of refuge in the Sea of Dreams. Knowledge of the Shianti faded with time, save in southern Magnamund where it became enshrined in legend, and the worship of them endured. Priests of the Shianti religion preserved their teachings and patiently awaited the day when the <quote>ancient ones</quote> would return, bringing with them lasting peace and the blessing of a new golden age.</p>
     <p>Two thousand years strode by and man advanced as Ishir had foretold. He built great cities and cultivated the land; his kingdoms rose and fell; he made war and loved and laughed and became master of his fate. But a new power was emerging in the province of Shadaki. There Shasarak the evil Wytch-king ruled. The black necromancer commanded an army of brutal soldiers and had a devoted following of men who upheld his religion of demonic worship and sacrificial rites. Devotees of the Shianti and other religious cults were persecuted in a merciless purge. Ruthlessly, the Wytch-king destroyed all his opponents and began a terrible war with the peoples of the neighbouring provinces. From the ruins of war Shasarak shaped the Shadakine Empire, subjugating whole nations to his evil rule. As the provinces fell to his might, the Shianti looked on helplessly, bound by their vow to the Goddess Ishir never to interfere in the affairs of man.</p>
     <p>On the night of the crowning of Shasarak as Overlord of the Shadakine Empire, a great storm broke upon the Sea of Dreams, a storm that raged with unnatural intensity. Lashed by wind and rain, illuminated by wild lightning, the waters heaved and danced in fury to the thundering music of the storm, unchecked by even the enchantments of the Shianti. When finally the tempest died, the Shianti looked out in amazement on the shattered hull of a ship drifting towards their shore. Never before had this occurred, for the enchantments and mage winds had kept them secure from the curiosity of man by forcing him to sail close to his own land.</p>
     <p>The Shianti went quickly to the ruined ship where they found only one survivor&emdash;a baby. They perceived the sudden arrival of this human child as a sign of great portent, and they conceived a plan by which they might lawfully aid mankind. They named the orphan child Grey Star, because a star is the symbol of hope in the Shianti faith, and because of the silver streak in the child&apos;s jet-black hair. In the shadow of the wrath of the Goddess Ishir, they raised the child as one of their own and taught him their secrets. Diligently they set about their instruction, for their aim was to provide a saviour for mankind. Armed with the might of Shianti wizardry and wisdom, their hope was to create an adversary equal in power to the evil Wytch-king of Shadaki, for they realized that only with the death of Shasarak would man once more be free to determine his destiny.</p>

     <p>You are Grey Star, trained in the ancient lore of a Shianti Wizard. For sixteen years you have dwelt in safety on the Isle of Lorn, the hidden realm of the magical Shianti race, until Acarya, High Wizard of the Shianti, decides to send you upon a dangerous quest: to save your own people, the race of man, from the tyrannical Wytch-king of Shadaki, Shasarak. Held by their ancient vow to the goddess Ishir, the Shianti are unable to leave their island either to come to the direct aid of man or to retrieve the Moonstone, which possesses the combined forces of all Shianti powers and lies hidden on another plane. As a human, no vow prohibits you from leaving the island and you have been sent to recover the Moonstone and commanded to use its power to defeat the Wytch-king. The Moonstone is hidden on the Daziarn plane, which can be entered only by finding one of its portals.</p>
     <p>Your quest begins with the search for the Shadow Gate, a doorway to the Daziarn that never remains in one place for longer than a day and is invisible to the human eye. To help you find the Shadow Gate you first seek the Lost Tribe of Lara, a race of magical but primitive creatures called the Kundi, who possess the gift of astral vision, enabling them to see the gateways to other worlds and dimensions.</p>
     <p>On first arriving at the Port of Suhn, the major trading port of the Shadakine Empire, you are befriended by Shan Li, a merchant who serves as your guide through these strange and foreign lands. A short while after, you are captured and imprisoned in the House of Correction, the prison of Suhn and citadel of Mother Magri, a Wytch in the service of Shasarak. Tanith, a young girl learning the ways of wytchcraft comes to your rescue. She helps you escape from the dungeons of Mother Magri and later sacrifices herself, calling the shadow demon, the Kleas&aacute;, against her to save you from its attack.</p>
     <p>After many more adventures you come, at last, to the Azanam, the treetop home of the Kundi. They give you Urik the Wise, an old Kundi Shaman, to guide you to the Shadow Gate. The two of you cross the dangerous lands of the Shadakine Empire, pursuing Urik&apos;s vision which leads you, finally, to the Forbidden City of Gyanima in the Mountains of Morn. Beyond is Desolation Valley and there you find the Shadow Gate. However, it is guarded by one of Shasarak&apos;s many slaves, a demon Kleas&aacute;; in fact the very Kleas&aacute; that captured Tanith, who stands in the Gateway, eternal prisoner of Shasarak unless you can free her. Finally you discover a way of releasing the Kleas&aacute; and opening the Gate.</p>
     <p>Bidding farewell to Urik, you prepare to enter the Gate.<!--ERRTAG-DE-16506/--></p>

     <footnote id="gamerulz-1-foot" idref="gamerulz-1"><p>This section of the rules implies that you must re-pick all three scores&emdash;<typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ>, <typ class="attribute">WILLPOWER</typ>, and <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ>&emdash;even though you may have already completed a previous adventure. This is without precedent in other books and therefore appears to be a mistake. In order to preserve rule consistency among the books, you may choose to retain your <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> and <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> scores and only re-pick you <typ class="attribute">WILLPOWER</typ> score.</p></footnote>
     <footnote id="gamerulz-2-foot" idref="gamerulz-2"><p>If you have completed book two but not book one, it seems reasonable to add 25 to the number you picked.</p></footnote>

For example, if you are the victim of an attack that drains your <typ class="attribute">WILLPOWER</typ>, your score may be forced below zero. If your <typ class="attribute">WILLPOWER</typ> falls to zero or below, you will not be able to cast spells or use your Wizard&apos;s Staff until your score is again above zero.</p></footnote>

If you pick 0 it counts as zero.</p>

     <p>The first number that you pick from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> in this way represents your <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ>. Add 10 to the number you picked and write the total in the <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> section of your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>. (e.g., if your pencil fell on the number 4 in the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> you would write in a <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> of 14.) When you fight, your <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> will be pitted against that of your enemy. A high score in this section is therefore very desirable.</p>

     <p>The second number that you pick from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> represents your <typ class="attribute">WILLPOWER</typ>.

If you decide to use a spell or utilize the power of your Wizard&apos;s Staff, then you will lose <typ class="attribute">WILLPOWER</typ> points. If at any time your <typ class="attribute">WILLPOWER</typ> falls to zero, you may not use any of your spells or your Wizard&apos;s Staff.<a id="gamerulz-3" idref="gamerulz-3-foot" class="footnote" /> Lost <typ class="attribute">WILLPOWER</typ> points can be regained during the course of the <!--ERRTAG-RE-18846-->adventure, and<!--/ERRTAG-RE-18846--> it is possible for your <typ class="attribute">WILLPOWER</typ> points to rise above the total with which you start your adventure.</p>

     <p>The third number that you pick from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> represents your powers of <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ>. Add 20 to this number and write the total in the <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> section of your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a> (e.g., if your pencil fell on the number 6 on the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> you would have 26 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points). If you are wounded in combat, you will lose <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points.

         <p><a idref="enchant-ill" class="accent-illustration" />The <!--ERRTAG-RA-21638-->Power<!--/ERRTAG-RA-21638--> of Enchantment enables a wizard to charm or beguile other creatures, and create illusions in the minds of others. He will be able to extract information from others, place thoughts and compulsions into another&apos;s mind or cause them to believe that imaginary events are actually taking place. Some magical or highly intelligent beings may be immune to the powers of Enchantment.</p>

         <p><a idref="elementl-ill" class="accent-illustration" />The Power of elemental magic allows a wizard some control over the natural elements of Air, Fire, Earth and Water. By entering a trance and chanting incantations, you may summon aid from the spirits of the Elemental Plane. Elementals have very little understanding of man, and for this reason a wizard can never be sure of the nature of the aid the Elementals may send.</p>

A wizard wishing to speak with the dead, or to call up a form from the spirit world, must draw a magic pentacle and enter a trance, when the use of the correct spell-chant will reach out to the Spiritual Plane. Standing within the protection of a magic pentacle, a wizard may consider himself to be relatively safe from harm. If he wishes to speak with a corpse, especially one whose former life was good and righteous, then a wizard can expect help and advice. However, contact with those whose former lives were evil or selfish can be a perilous, and often fatal, experience. Evil spirits are reluctant to return to the realm of the dead and may try to trick a wizard into freeing them into the world of the living. All spirits, good and evil, will require some service of the wizard in return for their aid. Any failure to perform this task, however difficult may result in the wizard losing his life.</p>

This is your main combat weapon, for you are untrained in the use of any other form of armed combat. It contains a potent force that is unleashed at will by the <!--ERRTAG-RA-21638-->Power<!--/ERRTAG-RA-21638--> of your mind, and causes a beam of destructive <!--ERRTAG-RA-21638-->Power<!--/ERRTAG-RA-21638--> to hurtle from its tip.

         <p>In the event that your enemy survives such an attack or should you fall victim to a surprise attack, you will be forced to engage in close combat and must attempt to strike your enemy with the Staff.

       <p>There will be occasions during your adventure when you have to fight an enemy. The enemy&apos;s <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> and <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points are given in the text. Grey Star&apos;s aim during the combat is to kill the enemy by reducing his <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points to zero while at the same time losing as few <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points as possible himself.</p>
       <p>At the start of a combat, enter Grey Star&apos;s <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> and <typ class="attribute">WILLPOWER</typ> points and the enemy&apos;s <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points in the appropriate boxes on the Combat Record section of your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
       <p>The sequence for combat is as follows:</p>
       <ol class="paragraphed">
        <li><p>Calculate your current <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> total, based on the weapon you are using. (Remember, if you enter combat without your Staff, you must deduct 6 points from your <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ>. If you have no weapon at all, you must deduct 8 points.)</p></li>
        <li><p>Subtract the <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> of your enemy from this total. The result is your Combat Ratio. Enter it on the <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>.</p></li>
        <li>
         <p><a id="stage3">If you are using your Wizard&apos;s Staff</a>, decide how many <typ class="attribute">WILLPOWER</typ> points you wish to use. (Remember, you must expend at least 1 point.) Enter this number on your Combat Record in the box marked <typ class="attribute">WILLPOWER</typ>.</p>
         <p>Example</p>
         <p>Grey Star (<typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> 15, <typ class="attribute">WILLPOWER</typ> 23) is ambushed by a Deathgaunt (<typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> 20). He is not given the opportunity to evade combat, but he can use his Wizard&apos;s Staff against the creature as it swoops down on him. He subtracts the Deathgaunt&apos;s <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> from his own, giving a Combat Ratio of &minus;5. (15 &minus; 20 = &minus;5). &minus;5 is noted on the <a idref="action">Action Chart</a> as the Combat Ratio. Grey Star decides to use 2 <typ class="attribute">WILLPOWER</typ> points, which is noted on the <typ class="attribute">WILLPOWER</typ> box of the Combat Record.</p>
        </li>
        <li><p>When you have decided upon the number of <typ class="attribute">WILLPOWER</typ> points you wish to use, and have determined your Combat Ratio, pick a number from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a>.</p></li>
        <li>
         <p>Turn to the <a idref="crtable">Combat Results Table</a><!--ERRTAG-DE-39627/-->. Along the top of the chart are shown the Combat Ratio numbers. Find the number that is the same as your Combat Ratio and cross-reference it With the random number that you have picked. (The random numbers appear on the side of the chart.) You now have the number of <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points lost by Grey Star. To calculate the number lost by the enemy, multiply this by the number of <typ class="attribute">WILLPOWER</typ> points that Grey Star elected to use. Now you have the final number of <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points lost by both Grey Star and his enemy in this round of combat. (E represents points lost by the enemy; GS represents points lost by Grey Star.)</p>
         <p>Example</p>
         <p>The Combat Ratio between Grey Star and the Deathgaunt has been established as &minus;5, and Grey Star&apos;s <typ class="attribute">WILLPOWER</typ> points used as 2. If the number taken from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> is a 6, then the result of the first round of combat is:</p>
         <ul>
          <li>Grey Star loses 4 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points.</li>
          <li>Deathgaunt loses 5 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points, multiplied by 2 <typ class="attribute">WILLPOWER</typ> points, giving a total of 10 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points lost in all.</li>
         </ul>
        </li>
        <li><p>On the <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>, mark the changes in <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points to the participants in the combat, and Grey Star&apos;s amended <typ class="attribute">WILLPOWER</typ> points total.</p></li>
        <li><p>Unless otherwise instructed, or unless you have an option to evade, the next round of combat now starts.</p></li>
        <li><p>Repeat the sequence from <a idref="stage3">Stage 3</a>.</p></li>
       </ol>

       <p>This process of combat continues until the <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points of either the enemy or4 Grey Star are reduced to zero, at which point the one with the zero score is declared dead. If Grey Star is dead, the adventure is over. If the enemy is dead, Grey Star proceeds but with his <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> and <typ class="attribute">WILLPOWER</typ> points reduced.</p>

         <p>During your adventure you may be given the chance to evade combat If you have already engaged in a round of combat and decide to evade, calculate the combat for that round in the usual manner. All points lost by the enemy as a result of that round are ignored, and you make your escape. Only Grey Star may lose <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points during that round, but then that is the risk of running away! You may only evade if the text of the particular section allows you to do so.</p>

     <p>You are about to begin a quest of utmost importance and terrible danger. Beware, for you enter a world quite different from the one you leave behind. Here, even the natural laws are strange and you will need all your wits and cunning to survive in this alien world.</p>
     <p>You will find items that might be of assistance. Some Special Items will help you on your quest, others may be of no use at all. You must decide what to keep.</p>
     <p>Be cautious in your use of <typ class="attribute">WILLPOWER</typ> points, as your <typ class="attribute">WILLPOWER</typ> is the energy source for your Magical Powers and your Wizard&apos;s Staff. A score of zero <typ class="attribute">WILLPOWER</typ> points will leave you weak and vulnerable to attack, unable to offer effective resistance.</p>
     <p>Follow the path of wisdom, Wizard Grey Star. The way of fools is the road to destruction!</p>

       <p>Tanith takes you by the hand and you step forward into a tunnel of swirling mist. As the outline of the Shadow Gate fades behind you, you gaze at your new surroundings. Horrified, you perceive strange shapes and pale faces writhing within the tunnel wall. The faces stare at you vacantly, mouthing indistinguishable words, and you walk along the tunnel to a barrage of murmuring voices, muffled cries, moaning and sobbing. Tanith looks at you but says nothing, the terror in her eyes mirroring your own. <quote>Such a place could drive a man insane,</quote> you say, quietly.</p>
       <p>The two of you walk faster into the unknown, your hearts pounding with anticipation. Finally, the tunnel opens on to a vast plain of white cloud suspended beneath a sunless sky. Stepping on to this twilit plain, you notice that the light of the sky casts no shadow and disappears into absolute blackness above your head. Looking down, you can see no solid ground beneath the cloud, which somehow supports you. Like the Shadow Gate before, the tunnel of mists fades away and you find yourself staring out across the bleak silence of the Daziarn. Scanning the distant horizon, you sight the outline of a building. Tanith tugs your arm. <quote>Look!</quote> she says, pointing away to the left. You follow the direction of her outstretched arm to see the hunched figure of a man, gliding slowly across the plain.</p>

       <p>The sad-eyed man looks at you solemnly. <quote>There is a mountain, the Moaning Mountain it is called. In the side of the mountain is a cavern and at the end of the cavern is a Gate from this realm to the next, a place known as the Vale of Peace. The people of the Vale are wise and friendly; they will show you the way to the hidden realm of the Moonstone. Here, take this map of the Moaning Mountain.</quote> He gives you a cloth map showing the location of the cavern. Mark this as a Special Item on your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a> and carry it in a small pocket inside your robe.</p>
       <p><quote>But first you must leave this realm and save the girl.</quote> You nod your head. <quote>You will have to bargain with the Master.</quote> You look puzzled and the man explains: <quote>All who come to the Realm of Paradox may ask for a gift from the god and, if it is within his power, he must give it. But beware his bargains. He has many cruel gifts; gifts such as these.</quote> Oz-na-Mun raises his hands and you look at them with horror. They are the hands of a giant and are grossly out of proportion with the rest of his body.</p>
       <p><quote>Once, I was a great sculptor and in my home realm of Meledor I was respected by all. But I hungered for greater success. I took up the company of a mage and one night we summoned the <!--ERRTAG-RA-59122-->Chaos-master<!--/ERRTAG-RA-59122--> together. His spirit came easily, for the realm of Meledor and the Realm of Paradox are joined. I told him <!--ERRTAG-RE-55764-->that I desired<!--/ERRTAG-RE-55764--> the greatest hands in the world that I might make the greatest sculptures in the world. He said he could grant me my wish on condition that I remain in his realm until completion of my first work. I agreed and as soon as I was brought here, I discovered that my hands had been transformed. However, they were not as I had wished: they were clumsy, rough, fit only for digging clay not shaping it. I have never made another piece.</quote> He curls a huge hand into a fist and punches the shapeless mass before him. <quote>Beware the bargains of the <!--ERRTAG-RA-59122-->Chaos-master<!--/ERRTAG-RA-59122-->. He is a malevolent god.</quote></p>
       <p><quote>What does he want with the girl, Tanith?</quote> you ask.</p>
       <p><quote>He will bargain with her, also.</quote> He tells you that you can summon the <!--ERRTAG-RA-59122-->Chaos-master<!--/ERRTAG-RA-59122--> by calling to him for audience. <quote>But beware! The bargains of the <!--ERRTAG-RA-59122-->Chaos-master<!--/ERRTAG-RA-59122--> are in keeping with the law of Paradox: opposites and contradictions.</quote></p>
       <p><quote>There is no other way of saving Tanith,</quote> you reply, sadly. <quote>I must summon the <!--ERRTAG-RA-59122-->Chaos-master<!--/ERRTAG-RA-59122-->.</quote></p>

       <p>You work your way down the steps of the palace and enter the avenue of crystal that leads from the Singing City. Moving at a painfully slow pace, you finally reach the grove of trees where your flying machine is hidden. You drag the statue on board and turn to the controls. The Ethetron rises up into the air and, using the Gyronome to guide you once more, you soon feel the strange tingling sensation that indicates that you are crossing the realms of the Daziarn.</p>

       <p>As you regain control of the flying machine you begin to slow down. You make a rather bumpy landing in a field but both you and your craft survive it unharmed. You take out the Gyronome and its shrill call confirms that you are now in the Realm of the Singing City. Away to your left and in the distance the city glints beneath the warm sunlight. Suddenly you notice several figures heading in your direction, though they are still far off.</p>

       <p>You are led to a high-ceilinged chamber lit by a curious, pulsing light. The room is filled with strange, ornate machines of gleaming metal. Lights flicker and you hear a throbbing hum and a continual, metallic, mechanical ring. Several Academicians tend the machines, pushing buttons and pulling levers, though to what purpose you cannot guess.</p>
       <p><quote>Grey Star, Tanith&emdash;allow me to introduce you to Crabkey, one of our greatest and most ingenious inventors.</quote></p>

       <p>You recognize the shabby man who turns to greet you; he was the man who sat in the armchair when you first entered the chamber of the Academicians. In the strange lurid glow of the laboratory his shadowed, bulging eyes make him appear even more sinister than before. <quote>We meet again,</quote> you say uncomfortably.</p>
       <p>Crabkey stares at you without speaking. Spittlethrift breaks the silence: <quote>Mr <!--ERRTAG-RE-130648-->Crabkey is<!--/ERRTAG-RE-130648--> the inventor of the machine that will enable you to journey to the Realm of the Singing City, <!--ERRTAG-RE-134180-->aren&apos;t you, Crabkey<!--/ERRTAG-RE-134180-->, old chap?</quote> Crabkey continues to stare at you insolently. With a slow blink of his huge eyes, he makes an unintelligible sound in the back of his throat and nods.</p>
       <p><quote>Yes, yes,</quote> says Spittlethrift half to himself. <quote>Come now, young Wizard and pretty mistress Tanith, come see his wonderful creation.</quote> Mounted on a small dais in the centre of the laboratory is a most unusual machine. <quote>This,</quote> says Spittlethrift proudly, <quote>is the Ethetron, the flying machine that will carry young Grey Star through the realms of the Daziarn, and to the Singing City to fetch our prize.</quote></p>
       <p><quote>Grey Star,</quote> says Tanith suddenly, <quote>and what of me?</quote></p>
       <p>Spittlethrift falters and emits an <!--ERRTAG-RE-131603-->embarrassed<!--/ERRTAG-RE-131603--> cough, <quote>Ah, yes&ellips; <!--ERRTAG-RE-135637-->well&ellips;<!--/ERRTAG-RE-135637--></quote></p>
       <p><quote>Yes, what of Tanith?</quote> you demand angrily.</p>
       <p><quote>The girl stays here,</quote> says Crabkey, speaking for the first time in a harsh, rasping voice, <quote>to make sure you keep your part of the bargain and do not fail to return.</quote></p>
       <p><quote>She will be perfectly safe, I assure you,</quote> says Spittlethrift, apologetically. <quote>But surely you understand our position. What is to stop you flying away and never returning?</quote></p>
       <p><quote>And if I refuse?</quote> you snap at Spittlethrift.</p>
       <p><quote>We will not allow you to use the Ethetron or show you how to fly it,</quote> retorts Crabkey. <quote>You will be doomed to remain within the Neverness for all eternity. You will&emdash;</quote></p>
       <p><quote>You will, on the other hand,</quote> Spittlethrift interjects hastily, <quote>receive the Ethetron as a gift from us when you return&emdash;</quote></p>
       <p><quote>With the Threnogem,</quote> Crabkey interrupts once more, ignoring a glare of warning from Spittlethrift, who has now begun to sweat profusely. <quote>And we will return Mistress Tanith to you, of course,</quote> he finishes. Tanith clenches her fists and glares furiously at the two little men. Both step back a little from her fiery gaze. <quote>Know this, little man,</quote> she hisses, prodding Spittlethrift in the chest with one, long-nailed finger. <quote>I am not without power. If you seek to deceive us&ellips; I&apos;ll crush you like the toad that you are! I am a Shadakine Wytch, not a mere girl to be hoarded or bartered like a piece of spare luggage!</quote></p>
       <p><quote>Yes, yes, of course,</quote> says Spittlethrift, wiping his brow with the back of his shaking hand. <quote>I understand.</quote></p>
       <p>You smile quietly to yourself. Tanith&apos;s angry bluff has shaken both Spittlethrift and Crabkey. Though Tanith does possess many uncanny powers taught to her while in the service of Mother Magri, a powerful Wytch in the service of the Shadakine Empire, her skills lie chiefly in her mastery of animals and nature and in a bravery that surpasses many warriors of greater stature. Tanith turns to you, the fire dying in her wild, green eyes. <quote>Accept their offer, Grey Star,</quote> she says. <quote>I do not fear this over-fed worm, or that slinking weasel.</quote></p>
       <p>You sense that Tanith is far more afraid than she admits but the success of the quest is as important to her as it is to you and without the Ethetron it is unlikely that you will succeed. <quote>Very well,</quote> you say. <quote>Show me how the machine works. What must I do?</quote></p>
       <p>Sullenly, Crabkey shows you the machine. Spittlethrift, pale and perspiring, remains silent, his chubby hands fluttering nervously at his side.</p>

His was the music of dissonance; it could drive men insane or lure them and possess their minds. Long we laboured in his service. However, we sought the beauty of harmonious music, the melody of accord and we conceived of a plan to overthrow our lord. We created the Threnogem, a tool of silence, for without silence music has no meaning. Then, while he slumbered, we dropped the Threnogem into his open mouth and silenced him, robbing him of his power over us. He froze in the position you see him now, for the statue is Steth-Amon, mastered by the silence of the Threnogem. That you seek to take the statue from our realm is pleasing to us, for all our power has been devoted to giving life to the Threnogem and keeping Steth-Amon silent. If the Threnogem is removed from his mouth the demon will be released. All we ask is that you do not remove the Threnogem while you are in our domain. If you wish, we will help you carry the statue to your flying machine.</thought></p>

       <p>The Ethetron is quite unlike anything you have seen before. It has a railed platform, and is shaped like a saucer, except that its stern is pointed like a lizard&apos;s tail. It bears a large glass dome in its centre. Passing through the top of the dome is a single black shaft like the mast of a sailing ship. The single sail resembles a giant bat&apos;s wing and is made of a strange material that shimmers like water and looks like metal but is like fabric to the touch. A closer inspection of the glass dome reveals that it contains a swirling, grey-white mist.</p>

       <p><quote>It is the raw stuff of the Daziarn, unformed power for the craft,</quote> explains Crabkey. <quote>Without it, the craft would fall from the sky. To steer,</quote> he continues, <quote>you must operate this lever&emdash;pull to climb, push to dive, left and right as normal. To draw more power from the glass dome you must press this metal bar at your feet; to slow down, release it. If you apply no pressure, the craft will remain where it is; if you push the lever to the left or right without power, the craft will spin on its axis. Beware, these controls are very sensitive. You need apply very little pressure to make the craft change its course.</quote></p>
       <p>When Crabkey is satisfied that you understand the controls, he introduces you to another Academician, Slypate, who hands you a shining sphere of red and yellow metal. <quote>This is a Gyronome. There is no north, east, west or south in the plane of the Daziarn, nor is there time as you perceive it,</quote> says Slypate. <quote>The only way of finding the Singing City is with the aid of this device. When you draw it out, it will emit a sound if you are heading for the Singing City. The louder the note, the surer your course. To return to the Crystal Tower, the Gyronome must be absolutely silent. It is very accurate: I invented it myself,</quote> he says with pride. You take the Special Item and place it in your pocket. (Remember to mark the Gyronome on your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>.)</p>
       <p>Soon you are ready to leave. The Academicians offer you the choice of the following <!--ERRTAG-RA-148465-->items<!--/ERRTAG-RA-148465--> to aid you in your quest. (Remember that you may carry only <!--ERRTAG-RE-148584-->two Weapons<!--/ERRTAG-RE-148584--> and a maximum of eight <!--ERRTAG-RA-148465-->items<!--/ERRTAG-RA-148465--> in your Backpack.)</p>

       <p>As you climb into the Ethetron, the massive double windows of the laboratory are drawn open. The restraining ropes are untied and the glass dome of the flying machine glows with a ghostly light. You coax the Ethetron forwards and you glide gently through the open windows and out of the Crystal Tower. You look out across the bleak, featureless expanse of the Neverness with its strange, sunless sky and vast plane of unending cloud. You press lightly on the foot bar and the machine gathers speed. You take out the Gyronome. It is silent at first, then as your machine speeds away from the Crystal Tower it begins to emit a tone. You move the instrument around in the air and find, to your surprise, that its tone becomes louder when you point it towards your feet.</p>

       <p>You head across the cloud plane towards the hunched figure. The man turns and looks at you, apparently unsurprised by your sudden appearance. He is dressed in grey, tattered rags and, with a start, you see that the flesh of his hands and face is almost transparent, revealing the veins, bones, and tissue that lie beneath his skin.</p>

       <p>The raging wind helps the Ethetron to stay airborne without power and, while the Jahksa is in a trance state communing with the Elementals, you take up your Staff. It is difficult to take accurate aim because of the violent movements of the craft and yet, with remarkable calmness and precision, you fire a direct hit into the Jahksa&apos;s chest. He leaps back and, with magical flames still smouldering in the remains of his robe, he staggers towards you. Without hesitation, Tanith rushes at the Jahksa and thrusts him over the rail. She gives you a look of triumph and you cannot resist a cheer.</p>
       <p>The storm blows itself out and quickly you bring the Ethetron back on course. You soon reach the Moaning Mountain and locate the cavern. With some skilful manoeuvring, you line up the ship with the opening and enter.</p>

       <p>A sky-blue sea with foam-crested waves rolls where the sky should be. Green hills and fields ripple and undulate like an ebb tide and the Ethetron begins to rock violently. Mountains stand on their peaks and towns and cities float haphazardly in the air. Night becomes day and day becomes night in the blink of an eye. A huge fist rears up, poised to strike, then passes through you like a phantom. All around you is the sound of crazed and forlorn laughter.</p>

       <p><thought>This was once the realm of the Demon, Steth-Amon, Master of Sound. We, the Elessin, were created his slave singers, a choir of the damned, and long did we labour in his service. His was the music of dissonance, designed to drive his victims insane or to lure them with its enticements. Steth-Amon would sow seeds of discord and clamour in the realms of mortals so that they would join him and then be doomed to lives of misery under his dominion. But we, the Elessin, conceived of a plan to overthrow him, for we desire the beauty of music: harmony and the melody of accord. We created the Threnogem, a tool of silence, for without silence there can be no true music. While he slumbered we dropped the Threnogem into his open mouth and silenced him. Robbed of his power, the power of his mighty voice, he froze as you see him now.</thought></p>
       <p>He gestures towards the statue beneath the swirling pillar of light. <thought>We built this place to contain him and called it the Palace of the Screaming God. Each day we sing our song, giving force to the Threnogem so that the Screaming God should remain forever silent. All our power is dedicated to this single act, for his was a great evil. If the Threnogem is removed, the Screaming God will be released. Those who have sent you upon this quest know not of this, or else they do not care. Perhaps they desire to free the Screaming God, or wish your death. However, there is a way for you to fulfil your bargain and do us a great service, too.</thought></p>
       <p>Yet another bargain! <quote>What is it you wish me to do?</quote> you ask.</p>
       <p><thought>Take the statue with you,</thought> the Guardian replies. <thought>Take it in your flying machine and remove it from this realm. Give the statue, with the Threnogem inside it, to the Academicians. Let them guard it as we have done. It would be just.</thought></p>

       <p><quote>Who are you?</quote> you ask, still breathless.</p>
       <p><quote>I am Spittlethrift, scholar, professor and master of the Crystal Tower. Yes, yes&ellips; a tower of learning, a veritable pillar of wisdom and knowledge, ha, ha, indeed!</quote> He takes a pair of wire-framed spectacles and places them on the end of his smudge of a nose. <quote>You are not <!--ERRTAG-RE-264296-->alone, I<!--/ERRTAG-RE-264296--> see.</quote> He squints at Tanith. <quote>Most pleasing, enchanting&ellips; yes, yes, well done! You have passed the test; you will suffice.</quote> He turns towards the door and flutters his hands in an agitated manner. <quote>Come now, you must meet the rest of us. Oh yes, delightful, engaging, so wonderfully entertaining!</quote></p>
       <p>The excitable little man leaves the room, still chuckling to himself, and you follow close behind. Soon, he ushers you into a dim room, which is dusty and full of cobwebs. The air is stale and thick with tobacco smoke and seated opposite in a large armchair is a thin, straggling man, roughly Spittlethrift&apos;s height, with bulging, shadowy eyes. Reclining in various positions around the room are several others, all approximately Spittlethrift&apos;s height, and all similarly dressed.</p>
       <p><quote>Gentlemen, gentlemen, we have guests, brave adventurers who have solved the complications of our dark abode. May I <!--ERRTAG-RE-265340-->introduce&ellips;<!--/ERRTAG-RE-265340--></quote></p>
       <p>He casts a questioning glance in your direction and, hesitantly, you say, <quote>The Wizard, Grey <!--ERRTAG-RE-265518-->Star, and the<!--/ERRTAG-RE-265518--> lady, Tanith.</quote></p>
       <p><quote>Yes, yes, Grey Star and Tanith,</quote> Spittlethrift repeats, unnecessarily. He turns to face you. <quote>And we are the Academicians. Welcome.</quote> He bows politely, as do the remaining scholars in the dingy room. After shaking hands with more than twenty <!--ERRTAG-RE-265887-->Academicians, all<!--/ERRTAG-RE-265887--> with very curious <!--ERRTAG-RE-265963-->names, you<!--/ERRTAG-RE-265963--> are led from the room to Spittlethrift&apos;s study. There he explains to you the cryptic nature of the Crystal Tower and the <!--ERRTAG-RE-266156-->Academicians&apos;<!--/ERRTAG-RE-266156--> purpose on the Daziarn plane.</p>
       <p><quote>We are scholars, my dear boy,</quote> says Spittlethrift. <quote>Inventors, scientists, inquisitors of the unknown. Here, on the Daziarn plane, we have been able to turn our dreams, our ideas, our very thoughts into reality. It is the nature of this place. Time, space, the fundamental laws that govern existence in the material world&emdash;all can be adjusted, altered, ignored even! That is why we choose to live here. Others have changed their world within the Daziarn to suit their purpose. The demons and devils of good and evil reside here, creating their surroundings as best it suits them. There are gods and their ilk, and stranger forces beyond all imagining. Their thoughts, hopes, fears and intentions weave the fabric of their realms. We do not seek to dominate or master the realm we inhabit&emdash;we live only within our tower. The Neverness&emdash;the unformed cloud that surrounds us&emdash;is the fabric of the Daziarn, unclaimed and untainted. It is this that we use for our&ellips; experiments.</quote></p>
       <p><quote>You mean the black holes that surround the tower?</quote> you enquire.</p>
       <p><quote>Yes, yes,</quote> Spittlethrift replies.</p>
       <p><quote>But why is the tower so dangerous?</quote></p>
       <p><quote>Ah!</quote> says Spittlethrift. <quote>Let me assure you that it is not for our simple amusement, nor is it due to a malicious dislike for visitors, that our tower has been built to test the cunning, the wits, the wiles, and the bravery of those who dare to enter.</quote></p>
       <p><quote>And those who fail?</quote> asks Tanith, scornfully. <quote>What happens to them?</quote></p>
       <p>The little man clears his throat, uncomfortably, dismissing Tanith&apos;s question with a wave of his hand. <quote>No matter of importance. You have succeeded; you&apos;ve triumphed. You have proved yourselves capable of fulfilling a great quest.</quote></p>
       <p><quote>I am already upon a quest,</quote> you say. <quote>I have no time for another.</quote></p>
       <p><quote>That is what you <!--ERRTAG-RE-268334-->think, m&apos;boy<!--/ERRTAG-RE-268334-->,</quote> says Spittlethrift. <quote>But you&apos;ve yet to understand. You are in the Neverness. The Neverness leads nowhere, borders on nowhere, is nowhere. Without our help you will never leave it. Embark upon our quest and we will grant you the means to travel freely about the Daziarn. Refuse, and you will remain here, perhaps forever.</quote></p>
       <p><quote>You threaten me?</quote> you say menacingly, rising to your feet.</p>
       <p><quote>No, no!</quote> splutters the scholar, hastily. <quote>I merely state the facts. The Neverness is a wilderland between the realms of the Daziarn but it does not connect the realms as the mountains, seas and roads in your world do. We, however, have found a way to travel the realms and can grant you the means to do so if you will perform a simple task for us.</quote> You say <!--ERRTAG-RE-269228-->nothing, and<!--/ERRTAG-RE-269228--> Spittlethrift goes on. <quote>There is a place, a city of glass, called the Singing City, inhabited by a race called the Elessin. We wish you to journey to the Singing City and steal the Threnogem from them. It is a stone, said to emit music and control the emotions of all who hear its melody. The Elessin have put it to evil use; we merely wish to explore its powers. You will be helping the enslaved and furthering our search for knowledge. Please will you help <!--ERRTAG-RE-269749-->us, Grey<!--/ERRTAG-RE-269749--> Star?</quote></p>

Tanith radiates a happiness and gaiety that you have seldom seen before. You ask about the Gate that leads to the Realm of the <!--ERRTAG-RE-343220-->Moonstone, and<!--/ERRTAG-RE-343220--> the elders tell you of the Silver Lake.</p>

       <p>That night, you and Tanith are led up into the mountains to a large lake. They tell you to board the Ethetron and fly above the beautiful lake. Then, when the moon has climbed to its highest point in the sky you must fly into the water, for the lake is the Gateway to the Realm of the Moonstone and the light and power of the moon its key. You do as they <!--ERRTAG-RE-352392-->instruct, and with<!--/ERRTAG-RE-352392--> a wave, you dive towards the Silver Lake, but as you break the <!--ERRTAG-RE-343770-->surface, it<!--/ERRTAG-RE-343770--> is not water that washes over <!--ERRTAG-RE-352553-->you but<!--/ERRTAG-RE-352553--> awe and wonder.</p>

    <meta><title>Footnotes</title></meta>

    <data>
     <p>(<a idref="gamerulz">The Game Rules</a>) This section of the rules implies that you must re-pick all three scores&emdash;<typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ>, <typ class="attribute">WILLPOWER</typ>, and <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ>&emdash;even though you may have already completed a previous adventure. This is without precedent in other books and therefore appears to be a mistake. In order to preserve rule consistency among the books, you may choose to retain your <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> and <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> scores and only re-pick you <typ class="attribute">WILLPOWER</typ> score.</p>
     <p>(<a idref="gamerulz">The Game Rules</a>) If you have completed book two but not book one, it seems reasonable to add 25 to the number you picked.</p>
     <p>(<a idref="gamerulz">The Game Rules</a>) It is possible for your <typ class="attribute">WILLPOWER</typ> to fall below zero. For example, if you are the victim of an attack that drains your <typ class="attribute">WILLPOWER</typ>, your score may be forced below zero. If your <typ class="attribute">WILLPOWER</typ> falls to zero or below, you will not be able to cast spells or use your Wizard&apos;s Staff until your score is again above zero.</p>
     <p>(<a idref="powers">Magical Powers</a>) The wording of this section of the rules seems to indicate&emdash;if read literally&emdash;that you may choose your set of Powers again if you have completed a previous adventure. This is without precedent in other books. In order to preserve consistency with other books, you should not choose your Powers again. If you have have completed at least one previous adventure, you may choose one additional Power from the list. If you choose Alchemy as your new Magical Power, you also receive a Herb Pouch with contents, as detailed in the <a idref="equipmnt">Equipment</a> section.</p>
     <p>(<a idref="equipmnt">Equipment</a>) If you have completed a previous adventure, you keep all equipment you had at the end of that adventure. You do not receive any new equipment, unless you have just selected Alchemy as your sixth Magical Power, in which case you receive a Herb Pouch with contents as indicated in this section.</p>
     <p>(<a idref="equipmnt">Equipment</a>) If you have mastered the Lesser Magick of Alchemy and therefore have a Herb Pouch, you may choose to keep potions, vials, or ingredients in either the Herb Pouch or your Backpack. All other Backpack Items must be kept in your Backpack.</p>
     <p>(<a idref="sect106">Section 106</a>) You may only choose a Key that you have not already tried.</p>
     <p>(<a idref="sect107">Section 107</a>) If the Elessi leader has been holding your Wizard&apos;s Staff until now, you can now take it back.</p>
     <p>(<a idref="sect118">Section 118</a>) If you have already opened this door, you do not need to do it again. If you have opened the door but chosen <em>not</em> to step through it, you can now choose to do so (turn to <a idref="sect125">125</a>), or to walk back to the large stairway (turn to <a idref="sect239">239</a>). If you have both opened and ventured inside the door, you must turn to <a idref="sect239">239</a>.</p>
     <p>(<a idref="sect144">Section 144</a>) There is no choice that leads to this section of the book. This appears to be an oversight which is not easily correctable.</p>
     <p>(<a idref="sect150">Section 150</a>) You may only choose a Key that you have not already tried.</p>
     <p>(<a idref="sect177">Section 177</a>) You must choose whether to keep the individual buds or to mix potions from them. You may not do both.</p>
     <p>(<a idref="sect186">Section 186</a>) You may only choose a Key that you have not already tried.</p>
     <p>(<a idref="sect190">Section 190</a>) There is no choice that leads to this section of the book. This appears to be an oversight which is not easily correctable.</p>
     <p>(<a idref="sect197">Section 197</a>) You may only choose a Key that you have not already tried.</p>
     <p>(<a idref="sect240">Section 240</a>) You may keep any Keys that you have already noted on your Action Chart. You may also keep any Keys that you have not used. List all Keys to the Crystal Tower as a single Backpack Item on your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a> (noting which Keys are included). If you do not want to carry the Keys in your Backpack, you can let Tanith carry them, but you must then note down that you cannot access them if Tanith is not with you.</p>
     <p>(<a idref="sect242">Section 242</a>) You may only choose a Key that you have not already tried.</p>
     <p>(<a idref="sect252">Section 252</a>) You may only choose a Key that you have not already tried.</p>
     <p>(<a idref="sect278">Section 278</a>) If you left your Backpack in the Ethetron, you now regain access to it and all of the items therein.</p>
     <p>(<a idref="sect287">Section 287</a>) You may only choose a Key that you have not already tried.</p>
     <p>(<a idref="sect305">Section 305</a>) If you choose to keep them, note the Coins and a maximum of one Medallion as Special Items on your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>. If you choose to keep more than one Medallion, the rest must be carried in your Backpack where they take up one space each.</p>
     <p>(<a idref="sect344">Section 344</a>) Make a note on your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a> that you have left your Backpack and all Backpack Items in the Ethetron. You will not have access to them again until you return to the Ethetron.</p>
