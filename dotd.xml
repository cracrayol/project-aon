     <p>You are Grand Master Lone Wolf, last of the Kai Lords of Sommerlund and sole survivor of a massacre that wiped out the First Order of your &eacute;lite warrior caste.</p>
     <p>It is the year MS 5077 and twenty-seven years have passed since your brave kinsmen perished at the hands of the Darklords of Helgedad. These champions of evil, who were sent forth by Naar, the King of the Darkness, to destroy the fertile world of Magnamund, have themselves since been destroyed. You vowed to avenge the murder of the Kai and you kept your pledge, for it was you who brought about their downfall when alone you infiltrated their foul domain&emdash;the Darklands&emdash;and caused the destruction of their leader, Archlord Gnaag, and the seat of his power that was the infernal city of Helgedad.</p>
     <p>In the wake of their destruction, chaos befell the Darkland armies who, until then, had been poised to conquer all of Magnamund. Some factions which comprised this huge army, most notably the barbaric Drakkarim, began to fight with the others for control. This disorder quickly escalated into an all-out civil war, which allowed the Freeland armies of Magnamund time in which to recover and launch a counter-offensive. Skilfully their commanders exploited the chaos and secured a swift and total victory over an enemy far superior in numbers.</p>
     <p>For seven years now peace has reigned in Sommerlund. Under your direction, the once-ruined monastery of the Kai has been thoroughly rebuilt and restored to its former glory, and the task of teaching a Second Order of Kai warriors the skills and proud traditions of your ancestors is also well under way. The new generation of Kai recruits, all of whom were born during the era of war against the Darklords, possess latent Kai skills and show exceptional promise. These skills will be nurtured and honed to perfection during their time at the Monastery so that they may teach and inspire future generations, thereby ensuring the continued security of your homeland in future years.</p>
     <p>Your attainment of the rank of Kai Grand Master brought with it great rewards. Some, such as the restoration of the Kai and the undying gratitude of your fellow Sommlending, could have been anticipated. Yet there have also been rewards which you could not possibly have foreseen. The discovery that within you lay the potential to develop Kai Disciplines beyond those of the Magnakai, which, until now, were thought to be the ultimate that a Kai Master could aspire to, was truly a revelation. Your discovery has inspired you to set out upon a new and previously unknown path in search of the wisdom and power that no Kai Lord before you has ever possessed. In the name of your creator, the God Kai, and for the greater glory of Sommerlund and the Goddess Ishir, you have vowed to reach the very pinnacle of Kai perfection&emdash;to attain all of the Grand Master Disciplines and become the first Kai Supreme Master.</p>
     <p>With diligence and determination you set about the restoration of the Kai Monastery and organized the training of the Second Order recruits. Your efforts were soon rewarded and, within the space of two short years, the first raw recruits had graduated to become a cadre of gifted Kai Masters who, in turn, were able to commence the teaching of their skills to subsequent intakes of Kai novices. Readily the Kai Masters rose to their newfound responsibilities, leaving you free to devote more of your time to the pursuit and perfection of the Grand Master Disciplines. During this period you also received expert tutelage in the ways of magic from two of your most trusted friends and advisors: Guildmaster Banedon, leader of the Brotherhood of the Crystal Star, and Lord Rimoah, speaker for the High Council of the Elder Magi.</p>
     <p>In the deepest subterranean level of the Monastery, a hundred feet below the Tower of the Sun, you ordered the excavation and construction of a special vault. In this magnificent chamber wrought of granite and gold, you placed the seven Lorestones of Nyxator, the gems of Kai power which you had recovered during your quest for the Magnakai. It was here, bathed in the golden light of those radiant gems, that you spent countless hours in pursuit of perfection. Sometimes alone, sometimes in the company of your two able advisors&emdash;Banedon and Rimoah&emdash;you worked hard to develop your innate Grand Master Disciplines, and grasp the fundamental secrets of Left-handed and Old Kingdom magic. During this time you noticed many remarkable changes taking place within your body: you became physically and mentally stronger, your five primary senses sharpened beyond all that you had experienced before, and, perhaps most remarkably, your body began to age at a much slower rate. Now, for every five years that elapse you age but one year.</p>
     <p>At this time many changes were occurring beyond the borders of Sommerlund. In the regions to the northeast of Magador and the Maakengorge, the Elder Magi of Dessi and the Herbwardens of Bautar were working together in an effort to restore the dusty volcanic wasteland to its former fertile state. It was the first tentative step towards the reclamation of all the Darklands. However, their progress was painfully slow, and both parties were resigned to the fact that their efforts to undo the damage caused by the Darklords would take centuries to complete.</p>
     <p>Following the destruction of the Darklords of Helgedad, the Giaks, the most numerous of all Gnaag&apos;s troops, fled into the Darklands and sought refuge in the gigantic city-fortresses of Nadgazad, Aarnak, Gournen, Akagazad and Kaag. Within each of these hellish strongholds, fierce fighting broke out as remnants of the Xaghash (lesser Darklords) and the Nadziranim (evil practitioners of Right-handed magic who once aided individual Darklord masters) fought for control. It is widely believed that by the time the Elder Magi and the Herbwardens reach the walls of these strongholds they will encounter no resistance; the occupants will have long since brought about their own extinction.</p>
     <p>Elsewhere, throughout Northern Magnamund, peace reigns victorious and the peoples of the Free Kingdoms rejoice in the knowledge that the age of the Darklords has finally come to an end. Readily men have exchanged their swords for hoes and their shields for ploughs, and now the only marching they do is along the ruts of their freshly furrowed fields. Few are the watchful eyes that scan the distant horizon in fear of what may appear, although there are still those who maintain their vigilance, for the agents of Naar come in many guises and there are those in Magnamund who wait quietly in the shadows for the chance to do his evil bidding.</p>
     <p>Already your newfound skills have been tested against Naar&apos;s agents and you have, on each such occasion, acquitted yourself admirably. But your continuing victories against his minions have enraged the Dark God, and rarely has his lust for vengeance been greater than it is at present. Recently, Lord Rimoah has counselled you to be extra vigilant, for he fears that Naar is getting ready to strike at Sommerlund anew. The Elder Magi have received warnings from President Kadharian of Magador that something strange is taking place in the north of his country, in the mountainous territory which borders upon the Maakengorge. Freak storms and unseasonal weather have swept this remote region, and the night skies over Lake Vorndarol have, for several weeks now, been illuminated by eerie, inexplicable lights.</p>
     <p>Lord Rimoah fears that Naar is plotting to revive Vashna, the greatest of all the Darklords, whose spirit is trapped deep within the fathomless reaches of the Maakengorge. It has remained there, in uneasy entombment, ever since the day the Darklord was defeated in battle by King Ulnar I of Sommerlund. Vashna&apos;s body, along with those of his loathsome troops, was hurled into the abyss, hopefully never to be seen again. Legend has it that the Darklord&apos;s body was destroyed but his spirit still lives on. He is said to be awaiting the day when he shall be made to rise, at the head of a vast army of undead warriors, and set loose to wreak his revenge upon Sommerlund and the house of Ulnar.</p>
     <p><quote>If it is Naar&apos;s intention to resurrect Vashna and his army from the depths of the Maakengorge,</quote> said an anxious Lord Rimoah, as you and he discussed the situation in the secure privacy of your vault below the Kai Monastery, <quote>then no free realm upon the face of Magnamund will be safe. It has always been Sommerlund&apos;s misfortune that Ulnar&apos;s victory over Vashna was never total. I have always feared that the legacy of the Maakengorge would one day awaken and confront us&ellips; and I fear, unless we act swiftly, that that day is about to dawn.</quote></p>
     <p>For several hours, you and your learned advisor deliberated what could be done to prevent such a catastrophe. You decided that the exact nature of the threat had first to be determined if you were to combat it effectively. You were confident that your Grand Master Disciplines would enable you to unravel this mystery quickly, and so you volunteered to journey to northern Magador and investigate the strange incidents at first hand. After all, there could be a perfectly innocent explanation for them.</p>
     <p><quote>Let us hope it is so, Grand Master,</quote> said Lord Rimoah, earnestly, <quote>but, nevertheless, do not forget what could confront you there. I shall pray to Kai and Ishir to watch over and guide you on the journey ahead, Lone Wolf, and bring you home, swiftly, safely and victoriously.</quote></p>

     <p>You keep a record of your adventure on the <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
     <p>For more than six years, ever since the demise of the Darklords of Helgedad, you have devoted yourself to developing further your fighting prowess&emdash;<typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ>&emdash;and physical stamina&emdash;<typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ>. Before you begin your first Grand Master adventure you need to measure how effective your training has been. To do this take a pencil and, with your eyes closed, point with the blunt end of it on to the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a>. If you pick a 0 it counts as zero.</p>
     <p>The first number that you pick from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> in this way represents your <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ>. Add 25 to the number you picked and write the total in the <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> section of your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a> (i.e., if your pencil fell on the number 6 in the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> you would write in a <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> of 31). When you fight, your <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> will be pitted against that of your enemy. A high score in this section is therefore very desirable.</p>
     <p>The second number that you pick from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> represents your powers of <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ>. Add 30 to this number and write the total in the <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> section of your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a> (i.e., if your pencil fell on the number 7 on the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> you would have 37 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points).</p>
     <p>If you are wounded in combat you will lose <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points. If at any time your <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points fall to zero, you are dead and the adventure is over. Lost <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points can be regained during the course of the adventure, but your number of <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points can never rise above the number you have when you start an adventure.</p>
     <p>If you have successfully completed any of the previous adventures in the Lone Wolf series (Books 1&endash;15), you can carry your current scores of <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> and <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points over to Book 16. These scores may include Weaponmastery, Curing, and Psi-surge bonuses obtained upon completion of Lone Wolf Kai (Books 1&endash;5) or Magnakai (Books 6&endash;12) adventures.<a id="gamerulz-1" idref="gamerulz-1-foot" class="footnote" /> Only if you have completed these previous adventures will you benefit from the appropriate bonuses in the course of the Grand Master series. You may also carry over any Weapons and Backpack Items you had in your possession at the end of your last adventure, and these should be entered on your new Grand Master <a idref="action">Action Chart</a> (you are still limited to two Weapons, but you may now carry up to ten Backpack Items).</p>
     <p>However, only the following Special Items may be carried over from the Lone Wolf Kai (Books 1&endash;5) and Magnakai (Books 6&endash;12) series to the Lone Wolf Grand Master series (Books 13-onwards):<a id="gamerulz-2" idref="gamerulz-2-foot" class="footnote"/></p>

       <p>Now, through the pursuit of your new skills and the further development of your innate Kai abilities, you have set out upon a path of discovery that no other Kai Grand Master has ever attempted with success. Your determination to become the first Kai Supreme Master, by acquiring total proficiency in all twelve of the Grand Master Disciplines, is an awe-inspiring challenge. You will be venturing into the unknown, pushing back the boundaries of human limitation in the pursuit of greatness and the cause of Good. May the blessings of the Gods Kai and Ishir go with you as you begin your brave and noble quest.</p>
       <p>In the years following the demise of the Darklords you have reached the rank of Kai Grand Defender, which means that you have mastered <em>four</em> of the Grand Master Disciplines listed below. It is up to you to choose which four Disciplines these are. As all of the Grand Master Disciplines will be of use to you at some point during your adventure, pick your four skills with care. The correct use of a Grand Master Discipline at the right time could save your life.</p>
       <p>When you have chosen your four Disciplines, enter them in the Grand Master Disciplines section of your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>.</p>

           <p>In order to use a Bow you must possess a quiver and at least one Arrow. Each time the Bow is used, erase an Arrow from your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>.

      <p>There will be occasions during your adventure when you have to fight an enemy. The enemy&apos;s <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> and <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points are given in the text. Lone Wolf&apos;s aim in the combat is to kill the enemy by reducing his <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points to zero while losing as few <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points as possible himself.</p>
      <p>At the start of a combat, enter Lone Wolf&apos;s and the enemy&apos;s <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points in the appropriate boxes on the Combat Record section of your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>. The sequence for combat is as follows:</p>
      <ol class="paragraphed"> 
       <li><p>Add any extra points gained through your Grand Master Disciplines and Special Items to your current <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> total.</p></li>
       <li>
        <p>Subtract the <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> of your enemy from this total. The result is your Combat Ratio. Enter it on the <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
        <p>Example</p>
        <p>Lone Wolf (<typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> 27) is attacked by a pack of Doomwolves (<typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> 30). He is taken by surprise and is not given the opportunity of evading their attack. Lone Wolf has the Grand Master Discipline of Kai-surge to which the Doomwolves are not immune, so Lone Wolf adds 8 points to his <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ>, giving him a total <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> of 35.</p>
        <p>He subtracts the Doomwolf pack&apos;s <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> from his own, giving a Combat Ratio of +5. (35&minus;30 = +5). +5 is noted on the <a idref="action">Action Chart</a> as the Combat Ratio.</p>
       </li>
       <li><p><a id="stage3">When you have your Combat Ratio</a>, pick a number from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a>.</p></li>
       <li>
        <p>Turn to the <a idref="crtable">Combat Results Table</a>. Along the top of the chart are shown the Combat Ratio numbers. Find the number that is the same as your Combat Ratio and cross-reference it with the random number that you have picked (the random numbers appear on the side of the chart). You now have the number of <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points lost by both Lone Wolf and his enemy in this round of combat. (E represents points lost by the enemy; LW represents points lost by Lone Wolf.)</p>
        <p>Example</p>
        <p>The Combat Ratio between Lone Wolf and the Doomwolf Pack has been established as +5. If the number picked from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> is a 2, then the result of the first round of combat is:</p>
        <ul>
         <li>Lone Wolf loses 3 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points (plus an additional 1 point for using Kai-surge).</li>
         <li>Doomwolf Pack loses 7 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points.</li>
        </ul>
       </li>
       <li><p>On the <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>, mark the changes in <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points to the participants in the combat.</p></li>
       <li><p>Unless otherwise instructed, or unless you have an option to evade, the next round of combat now starts.</p></li>
       <li><p>Repeat the sequence from <a idref="stage3">Stage 3.</a></p></li>
      </ol>

      <p>This process of combat continues until <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points of either the enemy or Lone Wolf are reduced to zero, at which point the one with the zero score is declared dead. If Lone Wolf is dead, the adventure is over. If the enemy is dead, Lone Wolf proceeds but with his <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points reduced.</p>

            <li><spell>Halt Missile</spell>&emdash;This causes any projected or hurled missile (i.e. Arrows, axes, crossbow bolts etc.) which may pose an immediate threat to the life of a Sun Knight, to cease its flight and remain stationary in mid-air. The effect of the spell lasts for 2&endash;3 seconds, allowing the Sun Knight sufficient time to move away from its line of flight. Initially only one missile can be affected by this spell, but the number increases as a Grand Master rises in rank.</li>
            <li><spell>Strength</spell>&emdash;By casting this spell, a Sun Knight is able to greatly increase his or her physical strength for a short duration. It can be used to lift or move heavy objects, or to effect a temporary increase in <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> and <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> scores whilst fighting an enemy in unarmed combat.<a id="imprvdsc-1" idref="imprvdsc-1-foot" class="footnote" /></li>

        <p>If you are a Grand Master who has reached the rank of Sun Lord (7 Disciplines), you will now benefit from improvements to the following Grand Master Disciplines:</p>
        <dl class="paragraphed">
          <dt>Grand Weaponmastery</dt>
           <dd><p>Sun Lords with this Discipline are able to cause the metal edge of any non-magical weapon to ignite and burn fiercely. When a weapon thus affected is used in combat, it inflicts an additional 1 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> point loss upon an enemy in every successful round of combat. This ability cannot be used with a wholly wooden weapon such as a quarterstaff.</p></dd>
          <dt>Assimilance</dt>
           <dd><p>Sun Lords who possess this skill are able to cause the outline of their bodies to become blurred and indistinct. By so doing, they can greatly increase their chances of avoiding magical and/or non-magical missiles directed at them.</p></dd>
          <dt>Grand Huntmastery</dt>
           <dd><p>Kai Sun Lords with this skill are able to see, with acute accuracy, light in the infrared spectrum, i.e. they can see complex patterns generated by heat in near or total darkness. They can also see light in the ultraviolet spectrum.</p></dd>
          <dt>Kai-surge</dt>
           <dd><p>Sun Lords who possess mastery of this Discipline are able to launch a Kai-blast&emdash;a pulse of intense psychic energy which is capable of affecting both psychically active and inactive enemies. This form of psychic attack is very effective, more so than a usual Kai-surge, Psi-surge or Mindblast. It can cause an enemy to lose between 2 and 18 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points in one attack. A Kai Sun Lord using Kai-blast determines the damage inflicted on an enemy by picking two numbers from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a>. These numbers should be added together (a <quote>0</quote> = 1) and the resultant total equals the damage inflicted. However, use of a Kai-blast will reduce a Sun Lord&apos;s <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points total by 4. It cannot be used in conjunction with any other form of psychic attack.</p></dd>
          <dt>Telegnosis</dt>
           <dd><p>Sun Lords who possess this Discipline are able to alter their body weight in order to walk successfully upon different kinds of surfaces, e.g. water, mud, lava, and quicksand. Time duration and degree of surface difficulty increases as a Grand Master rises in rank.</p></dd>
          <dt>Magi-magic</dt>
           <dd>
            <p>Grand Masters who have reached the rank of Sun Lord are able to use the following battle-spells of the Elder Magi:</p>
            <ul>
             <li><spell>Penetrate</spell>&emdash;This increases the penetrative energy of any Arrow or Arrow-like missile, launched by a Sun Lord.</li>
             <li><spell>Energy Grasp</spell>&emdash;This spell enables a Sun Lord to discharge a powerful electrical force into anything he or she touches. It is similar in effect to the Brotherhood spell <spell>Lightning Hand</spell>, but differs in that it is easier to control and channel the resulting energy. It also requires the actual touching of an object or an enemy to effect the spell.</li>

     <p>Northern Magador, which borders upon the Maakengorge, is a notoriously wild and treacherous region. Be wary and on your guard at all times, for you can expect little help from the outlaws and fell creatures who dwell in this area.</p>
     <p>Some of the things that you will encounter during your mission will be of use to you in this and future Lone Wolf books, while others may be red herrings of no real value at all. If you discover any items, be selective in what you choose to keep.</p>
     <p>Pick your four Grand Master Disciplines with care, for a wise choice will enable any player to complete the mission, no matter how weak their initial <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> and <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> scores may be. Successful completion of previous Lone Wolf adventures, although an advantage, is not essential for the completion of this Grand Master adventure.</p>
     <p>May the light of Kai and Ishir be your guide as you venture into the unknown.</p>

She smiles and calls for Tym, her husband, as she ushers you into the dark warmth of the smithy. Tym the blacksmith welcomes you with a firm handshake. 'My word, Petrea, we're honoured to have a journeyman with us tonight,' he says to his wife.</p>
       <p>You enjoy a delicious supper, during which the blacksmith asks a favour of you. His nephew and niece, who are staying at the blacksmithy, are due to return home to their village in the morning. They live in Searsby, which lies to the south, where the road to the Kai Monastery branches off from the main highway. All he asks is that you accompany them home. You can hardly refuse the blacksmith's request, especially after enjoying his food and hospitality.</p>

     <p>(<a idref="gamerulz">The Game Rules</a>) The Discipline bonuses mentioned do not affect your permanent scores. If you have completed previous adventures, the Disciplines that you have mastered may still be beneficial. See the Grand Master Rules section of the <a href="&link.rh;">Rules Handbook</a> for details.</p>
     <p>(<a idref="gamerulz">The Game Rules</a>) Note that this list is not identical to the one used in <cite><a href="&link.13tplor;">The Plague Lords of Ruel</a></cite>: this list is missing the Silver Bracers and Korlinium Scabbard. These items are restored to the list of permissible items from the Kai and Magnakai series again in <cite><a href="&link.17tdoi;">The Deathlord of Ixia</a></cite>. Presumably, therefore, it should be permissible to leave the Silver Bracers and Korlinium Scabbard in safekeeping at the monastery during the intervening books and retrieve them at the outset of <cite><a href="&link.17tdoi;">The Deathlord of Ixia</a></cite>.</p>
     <p>(<a idref="discplnz">Grand Master Disciplines</a>) The rules of the books in the Magnakai series (6&endash;12) and the fact that the <quote>rank of Kai Grand Defender&ellips; means you are skilled in two&ellips; weapons</quote> imply that for each book that you complete of the Grand Master series (13&endash;20), you will gain mastery of an additional Kai weapon. E.g. if you complete <cite>The Plague Lords of Ruel</cite> and have the Grand Master Discipline of Grand Weaponmastery at the beginning of the next book, you can choose an additional Weapon from the list to have Mastery of.</p>
     <p>(<a idref="imprvdsc">Improved Grand Master Disciplines</a>) The <spell>Strength</spell> spell is, in practice, also used in armed combat contrary to what is indicated here.</p>
     <p>(<a idref="sect1">1</a>) Note this Scroll as a Special Item that doesn&apos;t take up any space on your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
     <p>(<a idref="sect6">6</a>) This is the correct answer to the crystal dais grid in <a idref="sect164">Section 164</a>.</p>
     <p>(<a idref="sect10">10</a>) This is the correct answer to Shamath&apos;s riddle in <a idref="sect189">Section 189</a>.</p>
     <p>(<a idref="sect21">21</a>) If you have already spent all of your money, you have a choice: you may either give her an item of comparable or greater value, or you may simply disregard this cost.</p>
     <p>(<a idref="sect36">36</a>) The originally published edition of this book instructed you to add 5 points to your <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> score. We believe that our alteration to specify restoration instead of addition is closer to the intent of the author. The original led to several questions. Would this additional score be a permanent increase of your maximum <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ>? Permanent alterations of basic scores in the middle of an adventure are rare making this option unlikely. Nor does the context support this conclusion. Then would this addition only be for the duration of the combat similar to the bonus to <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ>? This makes the bonus useless. If you were to complete the combat with fewer than 5 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points remaining and then removed the bonus after the combat was over, you would be just as dead as without the bonus. Another proposal was that you should remove the bonus from your score only if it leaves your score above the normal maximum after the combat. Although reasonable, this probably wasn&apos;t the intent of the author since he did not specify this procedure. We have opted for the simplest, most straightforward choice: that this is just a restorative effect.</p>
     <p>(<a idref="sect54">54</a>) There are strong indications that Arch Druid Cadak should be immune to both Mind Blast and Psi-surge but not Kai-surge. The Cener High Priest fought in <a href="&link.13tplor;">The Plague Lords of Ruel</a> Sections 156 and 212 is immune to these lesser psychic Disciplines, and <a idref="sect267">Section 267</a> of this book describes Arch Druid Cadak&apos;s inner mind as <quote>well-shielded</quote>.</p>

     <p>(<a idref="sect110">110</a>) This is the correct answer to second sequence of numbers on the crystal dais grid in <a idref="sect235">Section 235</a>.</p>
     <p>(<a idref="sect112">112</a>) You may also eat a single Meal and only lose 3 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points.</p>

     <p>(<a idref="sect142">142</a>) The originally published edition of this book instructed you to add 5 points to your <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> score.

     <p>(<a idref="sect143">143</a>) It is most likely that these Discipline bonuses are not intended to be cumulative.</p>
     <p>(<a idref="sect150">150</a>) It is most likely that these Discipline bonuses are not intended to be cumulative.</p>
     <p>(<a idref="sect164">164</a>) The section corresponding to the correct answer will have a footnote confirming that it is indeed correct. You have only one chance to guess at the correct answer. If you guess incorrectly, <a idref="sect235">turn immediately to 235</a>.</p>
     <p>(<a idref="sect189">189</a>) The correct method for finding the solution of this riddle has eluded readers ever since <cite>The Legacy of Vashna</cite> was published (as befits a riddle posed by an immortal demoness).

The section corresponding to the correct answer will have a footnote confirming that it is indeed correct. You have only one chance to guess at the correct answer. If you guess incorrectly, <a idref="sect216">turn immediately to 216</a>.</p>
     <p>(<a idref="sect229">229</a>) Since this attack is described as a <quote>Kai-blast</quote>, you should deduct 4 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points from your current score.</p>
     <p>(<a idref="sect229">229</a>) The originally published edition of this book instructed you to add 5 points to your <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> score.

     <p>(<a idref="sect267">267</a>) There are strong indications that Arch Druid Cadak should be immune to both Mind Blast and Psi-surge but not Kai-surge. The Cener High Priest fought in <a href="&link.13tplor;">The Plague Lords of Ruel</a> Sections 156 and 212 is immune to these lesser psychic Disciplines, and this Section describes Arch Druid Cadak&apos;s inner mind as <quote>well-shielded</quote>.</p>
     <p>(<a idref="sect293">293</a>) There is no indication whether or not the extra meals that you gather as you ride should also have a curative effect. If you decide that they do, record each on your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a> as <quote>Meal +3 <typ class="attribute">EP</typ></quote>.</p>
     <p>(<a idref="sect332">332</a>) If you have already spent all of your money, you have a choice: you may either give her an item of comparable or greater value, or you may simply disregard this cost.</p>
