   <p>The moment you draw the dagger from your belt, a blue flame courses the length of its twisted blade and the squealing flood of Crypt Spawn soar upward towards the roof in order to avoid you. They and their creator, Darklord Kraagensk<ch.ucirc/>l, recognize the power you wield and both are in awe and terror of it. Freed from the threat of his loathsome summonations, you now advance upon Kraagensk<ch.ucirc/>l with the dagger before you. He screams in anger and lunges at your head, his sword ablaze with tongues of black fire. You catch the blow on the tip of the dagger and both blades spark furiously as their terrible powers collide.<ch.ellips/></p>

     <p>You are the warrior, Lone Wolf, last of the Kai Masters of Sommerlund and sole survivor of the massacre that destroyed your kinsmen during a bitter war with your age-old enemies<ch.emdash/>the Darklords of Helgedad.</p>
     <p>Many centuries have passed since Sun Eagle, the first of your kind, established the Order of the Kai. Aided by the magicians of Dessi, he completed a perilous quest to find seven crystals of power known as the Lorestones of Nyxator, and upon their discovery he unlocked a wisdom and strength that lay within both the Lorestones and himself. He recorded the nature of his discoveries and his experiences in a great tome entitled The Book of the Magnakai. You found this lost Kai treasure and gave a solemn pledge to restore the Kai to their former glory, thereby ensuring the security of your land in the years to come. To fulfil your pledge, you embarked on the same quest that was undertaken by Sun Eagle over one thousand years ago: the search for the seven crystals of power that hold the power and wisdom of your ancestors.</p>
     <p>Your quest was to take you far from your northern homeland. Following in the footsteps of the first Kai Grand Master you journeyed to Dessi and sought the help of the Elder Magi, the magicians who aided Sun Eagle on his quest long ago. There you learned that for centuries the Elder Magi had awaited your coming. An ancient Dessi legend told of the birth and rise to greatness of two <foreign xml:lang="x-dessi">koura-tas-kai</foreign>, which means <quote>Sons of the Sun</quote>. One was named <foreign xml:lang="x-dessi">Ikar</foreign>, which means <quote>eagle</quote>, and the other was named <foreign xml:lang="x-dessi">Skarn</foreign>, which means <quote>wolf</quote>. A prophecy foretold that the <foreign xml:lang="x-dessi">Koura-tas-Kai</foreign> would each come from out of the north to seek the counsel of the Elder Magi in order that they might fulfil a great quest. Although separated by several centuries, they would share one spirit, one purpose and one destiny<ch.emdash/>to triumph over the champions of darkness in an age of great peril. The Elder Magi knew that you were <foreign xml:lang="x-dessi">Skarn</foreign>, the wolf of Dessi legend, and in keeping with their ancient vows they promised to help you complete the Magnakai quest.</p>
     <p>In Elzian, the capital of Dessi, you were tutored an the histories of Magnamund and received lessons in lore that you would have learned from the Kai masters if only they, like you, had survived the murderous Darklord attack on the Kai Monastery. You were eager to learn all that the Elder Magi could teach you in preparation for your quest, but war was to cut short your tuition. In the Darklands capital of Helgedad a struggle for power had been won by a Darklord called Gnaag. The other Darklords, fourteen in number, united behind their new leader and upon his command began to muster huge armies in preparation for the conquest of Magnamund. Swiftly their Giak legions grew in number, enabling Gnaag to launch a sweeping invasion that was to catch the Freelands unprepared. His legions advanced unchecked until, at the momentous Battle of Tahou, you turned the tide of the war decisively against Gnaag by defeating his powerful ally, Zakhan Kimah, in mortal combat.</p>
     <p>Victory at Tahou paved the way for the liberation of all the lands that Gnaag had taken by force. But the sweet taste of this victory was to turn sour when you discovered that he had captured the last three remaining Lorestones of Nyxator, and had vowed to avenge his defeat by destroying them and killing you. Alarmed by this news, the High Council of the Elder Magi helped you to formulate a plan of action. They had received news from allies in the west that the Lorestones were being held in the city-fortress of Torgar, where Gnaag<ch.apos/>s sorcerers<ch.emdash/>the Nadziranim<ch.emdash/>were searching for a means of destroying them. Fearing that they might achieve their goal, the Elder Magi made preparations for your secret passage to Torgar and, after a long and perilous journey, you arrived to find it besieged by the allied armies of Talestria and Palmyrion. During the many months of the Darklord invasion, hundreds of Talestrians were enslaved and sent to labour in the dungeons and sulphur mines deep within the bowels of Torgar. Their plight had seemed hopeless until the allied armies, under the command of Lord Adamas of Garthen, finally arrived to liberate them. Due in part your bravery and skill during the assault, Lord Adamas<ch.apos/>s troops were able to breach the great Torgar gate and storm its citadel. During this fierce battle you gained entry to the chamber at the heart of the citadel where the Nadziranim were attempting to destroy the Lorestones. Above a circular black pit the three radiant gems hung suspended in a fireball of negative energy, the focal point of several beams of power arising from crystals set around the edge of the pit. By means of a gantry you were able to climb above these energy beams and retrieve one of the three Lorestones. But, as you reached out for the remaining two, the terrible voice of Darklord Gnaag filled the chamber. <quote>Vengeance is mine!</quote> he rasped, and in the next instant a bolt of blue lightning leapt from a crystal that he held in his fly-like hand. It sheared through the rusty iron gantry, creating a shock wave that sent the Lorestones tumbling Into the black pit. A second bolt ripped the gantry in two, and, with the ghastly laugh of Darklord Gnaag ringing in your ears, you fell headlong into a portal of total darkness<ch.emdash/>a Shadow Gate<ch.emdash/>which led to the twilight world of the Daziarn Plane.</p>
     <p>When first you looked upon the desolate wastelands of the Daziarn, you recalled what little you had heard tell of this alien world. The magicians of Sommerlund believe it to be an astral corridor, connecting and binding the planet Magnamund to other planes of existence. By passing through a Shadow Gate<ch.emdash/>one of which is situated below their Guildhall in the city of Toran<ch.emdash/>a person could gain entry to the Daziarn. However, all those who had ever passed through the Shadow Gate of Toran had never been seen again, prompting the magicians to believe that the journey could only be made in one direction. It was said that from the Daziarn there was no escape.</p>
     <p>Your vow to restore the Kai, and your stubborn will to survive against all odds, made you even more determined to recover the last two Lorestones and find a way of returning to your home world. In the course of your search you discovered that your fight against the forces of darkness was the focus of a greater conflict raging throughout all the planes of existence, and that the time had come when the actions of one individual would shape the future of every living thing. It came as a great revelation to discover that you were that individual.</p>
     <p>Part of your destiny was fulfilled when you fought and defeated the Chaos-master, the leader of the evil force that threatened to conquer the Daziarn. You recovered one of the Lorestones and, with the help of a god-like creature called Serocca, you were able to find the location of a Shadow Gate that would return you to your own world. Here your quest culminated in a battle with your old enemy, Vonotar the Traitor, who had found the last Lorestone and who controlled the city wherein lay the Shadow Gate. He had intended to use the power of the Lorestone to enable him to return to Magnamund, but your bravery and determination put paid to his plans. In a desperate fight, on the very threshold of the Shadow Gate itself, you slew him and retrieved the last Lorestone, thereby completing the Magnakai Quest. Instantly an overwhelming wave of power was transfused into your being, lifting you to a level of consciousness that transcended your mortal frame. You surrendered to this power and, under its guidance, you were drawn inexorably towards the Shadow Gate. Willingly you stepped into the icy darkness and began your triumphant return to the world where you were born.</p>

     <p>You keep a record of your adventure on the <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
     <p>During your training as a Kai Master you have developed fighting prowess<ch.emdash/><typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> and physical stamina<ch.emdash/><typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ>. Before you set off on your adventure you need to measure how effective your training has been. To do this take a pencil and, with your eyes closed, point with the blunt end of it on to the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a>. If you pick 0 it counts as zero.</p>
     <p>The first number that you pick from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> in this way represents your <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ>. Add 10 to the number you picked and write the total in the <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> section of your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>. (i.e. if your pencil fell on the number 4 in the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> you would write in a <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> of 14.) When you fight, your <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> will be pitted against that of your enemy. A high score in this section is therefore very desirable.</p>
     <p>The second number that you pick from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> represents your powers of <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ>. Add 20 to this number and write the total in the <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> section of your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>. (i.e. if your pencil fell on the number 6 on the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> you would have 26 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points.)</p>
     <p>If you are wounded in combat you will lose <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points. If at any time your <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points fall to zero or below, you are dead and the adventure is over. Lost <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points can be regained during the course of the adventure, but your number of <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points can never rise above the number you started with.</p>
     <p><strong>If you have successfully completed any of the previous adventures in the <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> series</strong>, you can carry your current scores of <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> and <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points over to Book 12. You may also carry over any Weapons and Special Items you have in your possession at the end of your last adventure, and these should be entered on your new <a idref="action">Action Chart</a> (you are still limited to two Weapons and eight Backpack Items).</p>
     <p>You many choose one bonus <a idref="discplnz">Magnakai Discipline</a> to add to your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a> for every <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> Magnakai adventure you successfully complete (Books 6<ch.endash/>12).</p>

       <p>During your training as a Kai Lord, and in the course of the adventures that led to the discovery of <cite>The Book of the Magnakai</cite>, you have mastered all ten of the basic warrior skills known as the Kai Disciplines.</p>
       <p>After studying <cite>The Book of the Magnakai</cite>, you have also reached the rank of Kai Master Superior, which means that you have learnt <em>three</em> of the Magnakai Disciplines listed below. It is up to you to choose which three skills these are. As all of the Magnakai Disciplines will be of use to you at some point on your adventure, pick your three with care. The correct use of a Magnakai Discipline at the right time can save your life.</p>
       <p>The Magnakai skills are divided into groups, each of which is governed by a separate school of training. These groups are called <quote>Lore-circles</quote>. By mastering all of the Magnakai Disciplines in a particular Lore-circle, you can gain an increase in your <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> and <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points score. (See the section <quote><a idref="lorecrcl">Lore-circles of the Magnakai</a></quote> for details of these bonuses.)</p>
       <p>When you have chosen your three Magnakai Disciplines, enter them in the Magnakai Disciplines section of your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>.</p>

         <p>This Magnakai Discipline enables a Kai Master to become proficient in the use of all types of weapon. When you enter combat with a weapon you have mastered, you add 3 points to your <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ>. The rank of Kai Master Superior, with which you begin the Magnakai series, means you are skilled in <em>three</em> of the weapons in the list below.</p>

       <p>Before you leave Toran and begin your fateful mission, Banedon gives you a <a idref="map">map</a> of the Darklands and a pouch of gold. To find out how much gold is in the pouch, pick a number from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a>. Add 10 to the number you have picked.

       <p>Banedon also makes available a choice of equipment to help you survive in the hostile enemy heartland. For the voyage into the cold waters of the Kaltesee, you are given special fur-lined clothing, sturdy boots, and a hooded cape made from waterproof Kalkoth hide. You may also take six items from the following list, to add to any you may already possess. However, remember that you can carry a maximum of two Weapons and eight Backpack Items.</p>

       <p>There will be occasions during your adventure when you have to fight an enemy. The enemy<ch.apos/>s <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> and <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points are given in the text. Lone Wolf<ch.apos/>s aim in the combat is to kill the enemy by reducing his <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points to zero while losing as few <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points as possible himself.</p>
       <p>At the start of a combat, enter Lone Wolf<ch.apos/>s and the enemy<ch.apos/>s <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points in the appropriate boxes on the Combat Record section of your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
       <p>The sequence for combat is as follows:</p>
       <ol class="paragraphed">
        <li><p>Add any extra points gained through your Magnakai Disciplines and Special Items to your current <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> total.</p></li>
        <li>
         <p>Subtract the <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> of your enemy from this total. The result is your Combat Ratio. Enter it on the <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
         <p>Example</p>
         <p>Lone Wolf (<typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> 15) is attacked by a Nightstalker (<typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> 22). He is not given the opportunity to evade combat but must stand and fight as the creature leaps on him. Lone Wolf has the Magnakai Discipline of Psi-surge to which the Nightstalker is not immune, so Lone Wolf adds 4 points to his <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ>, giving a total <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> of 19.</p>
         <p>He subtracts the Nightstalker<ch.apos/>s <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> from his own, giving a Combat Ratio of <ch.minus/>3. (19 <ch.minus/> 22 = <ch.minus/>3). <ch.minus/>3 is noted on the <a idref="action">Action Chart</a> as the Combat Ratio.</p>
        </li>
        <li><p><a id="stage3">When you have your Combat Ratio</a>, pick a number from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a>.</p></li>
        <li>
         <p>Turn to the <a idref="crtable">Combat Results Table</a>. Along the top of the chart are shown the Combat Ratio numbers. Find the number that is the same as your Combat Ratio and cross-reference it with the random number that you have picked (the random numbers appear on the side of the chart). You now have the number of <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points lost by both Lone Wolf and his enemy in this round of combat. (E represents points lost by the enemy; LW represents points lost by Lone Wolf.)</p>
         <p>Example</p>
         <p>The Combat Ratio between Lone Wolf and the Nightstalker has been established as <ch.minus/>3. If the number taken from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> is a 6, then the result of the first round of combat is:</p>
         <ul>
          <li>Lone Wolf loses 3 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points (plus an additional 2 points for using Psi-surge)</li>
          <li>Nightstalker loses 6 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points</li>
         </ul>
        </li>
        <li><p>On the <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>, mark the changes in <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points to the participants in the combat.</p></li>
        <li><p>Unless otherwise instructed, or unless you have an option to evade, the next round of combat now starts.</p></li>
        <li><p>Repeat the sequence from <a idref="stage3">Stage 3</a>.</p></li>
       </ol>
       <p>This process of combat continues until the <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points of either the enemy or Lone Wolf are reduced to zero or below, at which point the one with the zero score is declared dead. If Lone Wolf is dead, the adventure is over. If the enemy is dead, Lone Wolf proceeds but with his <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points possibly reduced.</p>

       <p>In the years before their massacre, the Kai Masters of Sommerlund devoted themselves to the study of the Magnakai. These skills were divided into four schools of training called <quote>Lore-circles</quote>. By mastering all of the Magnakai Disciplines of a Lore-circle, the Kai Masters developed their fighting prowess (<typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ>), and their physical and mental stamina (<typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ>) to a level far higher than any mortal warrior could otherwise attain.</p>
       <p>Listed below are the four Lore-circles of the Magnakai and the skills that must be mastered in order to complete them.</p>
       <dl>
        <dt>Circle of Fire</dt>

       <p>As you rise through the higher levels of Magnakai training you will find that some of your skills will steadily improve. If you have reached the rank of Primate (four skills), Tutelary (five skills), Principalin (six skills), Mentora (seven skills), Scion-kai (eight skills) or Archmaster (nine skills), you will now benefit from improvements to the following Magnakai Disciplines:</p>

           <dd>Primates with this skill have the ability to delay the effects of poisons, including venoms, that they may come into contact with. Although a Kai Primate with this skill is not able to neutralize a poison he is able to slow its effect, giving him more time to find an antidote or cure.</dd>
          <dt>Huntmastery</dt>
           <dd>Primates with this skill have a greatly increased agility and be able to climb without the use of climbing aids, such as ropes, etc.</dd>

           <dd>Scion-kai are able to leave their body in a state of suspended animation and, in spirit form, explore their immediate surroundings unhindered by physical limitations. This ability is called <quote>spirit walking</quote>. The length of time a Kai Master can spirit walk increases as he rises in rank. When the spirit is separated from the body in this fashion, the body remains inanimate and vulnerable to attack. If a Kai Master<ch.apos/>s body is killed whilst he is spirit walking, his spiritual self will also cease to exist, and vice versa.</dd>

     <p>Your mission to destroy Darklord Gnaag will be fraught with awesome dangers. Be secretive and be on your guard at all times, for the creatures of the Darklands will stop at nothing to destroy you should your return to Magnamund become known to them.</p>
     <p>Some of the things that you will find during your mission will be of use to you, and some may be red herrings of no real value at all, so be selective in what you decide to keep.</p>
     <p>If this is your first Magnakai adventure be sure to choose your three Magnakai Disciplines with care, for a wise choice enables any player to complete the quest, no matter how weak their initial <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> and <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points scores. Successful completion of previous <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> adventures, although an advantage, is not essential for the completion of this Magnakai adventure.</p>
     <p>At last the chance to avenge the massacre of the Kai is within your grasp. The restoration of your warrior brotherhood and the future of Magnamund depend on your success. May the spirit of your ancestors and the wisdom of the great God Kai guide you to victory and the fulfilment of your destiny.</p>

       <p>Upon entering the Shadow Gate you are submerged in total darkness and fall into a lightless void. Relentlessly you are buffeted and numbed by an intense coldness that drains the strength from your body and fills your mind with strange, dream-like images. It is as if you are being sucked into the heart of a swirling black abyss, and, as your senses fade, you pray that you have enough strength to survive your return to Magnamund.</p>
       <p>Barely a flicker of consciousness remains when the sensation of warmth returns to your frozen limbs. It revives you and slowly you become aware of a fluorescent mist and a pinpoint of light in the far distance. The sensation of falling is replaced by a smooth forward movement, as if you are gliding to a halt at the end of a steep slide. Rapidly the tiny light grows larger until suddenly you emerge from the darkness and find yourself standing in a place that you recognize immediately.</p>
       <p>Pick a number from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> (if you pick a 0 it counts as 10). The number you have picked represents the number of <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points you have lost during your passage through the Shadow Gate.

Darkness engulfs your vision and your ears are filled with a ghastly sound<ch.emdash/>the mocking laughter of Darklord Gnaag.

He is a Drakkarim marine armed with a stiletto dagger, whose needle-thin blade glows wetly crimson in the flickering light of the fire.

It hits with terrific force but, to your utter amazement, it fails to penetrate his flesh; the shaft shatters into a dozen harmless shards.

Immediately, he strikes again, swinging his blade back in a vicious arc that is aimed at your throat. You block the blow but it costs you your bow, chopped almost in half as it stops the blade barely inches from your chin (remember to delete this Weapon from your <a idref="action">Weapons List</a>).

       <p>You pull away from your adversary and retreat towards the middle of the ship. There, a group of Kirlundins have drawn up in a circle and are holding their ground behind a wall of shields. You join them and take command as a second wave of Drakkarim clamber over the side and come howling across the deck. With a noise like thunder they fall upon the group, their swords and axes drawing sparks as they rain down upon the shield-wall with numbing force. The shock of their impact drives the Kirlundins back, opening gaps in their defence through which the strongest Drakkarim hurl themselves recklessly. One breaks through close to where you stand and stabs at your neck with his blunted sword.</p>

       <p>The day is but an hour old when suddenly it begins to get darker. A ceiling of black cloud spreads across the sky, fed by billowing plumes of noxious gases that pour from the cracks and craters of the southern wastes. Violent electrical storms rage in these plumes and a thunderous rumbling, like the growling of an angry giant disturbed from sleep, echoes in the bowels of the lifeless earth.</p>
       <p>A redness in the clouds grows stronger as the Zlanbeast flies westwards. It fills the horizon, setting your pulse racing as you sense that Nengud-kor-Adez, the chasm of fire that surrounds Helgedad, is the source of the scarlet glow. You correct your course, steering the Zlanbeast away to the north, and within minutes you catch your first glimpse of Aarnak.</p>
       <p>It is a grim spectacle, a mass of huge steel buildings grouped haphazardly around the mouth of a frigid estuary, surrounded in turn by a defensive ring of spike-topped earthworks. Everything appears to be eaten by rust, aggravated by clouds of corrosive steam that arise from rivulets of black water criss-crossing the ground. It strikes you as an uninhabitable place, yet its murky thoroughfares are teeming with thousands of grey-skinned creatures all pulling or pushing great iron carts filled with ore. As the Zlanbeast speeds towards the city, you search for somewhere suitable to land.</p>

       <p>Using your Kai skill, you will the Zlanbeast to cease its incessant caw. Immediately it obeys your psychic command and shuffles to the end of its perch, its head bowed and its eyes half closed. The Death Knight starts to turn away from the parapet, but his movements are slow and relaxed, and he is totally unprepared to receive your attack. Like a striking viper you lash out at his chest with deadly effect.</p>

       <p>The tide bears you swiftly towards a shingle beach, which is littered with huge, sea-smoothed boulders. The hissing surf and the screech of the loathsome sea-scavengers echo all along this barren coastline. It is an unwelcoming sound<ch.emdash/>cold and hostile<ch.emdash/>a fitting reflection of the land itself.</p>
       <p>Ten yards from the stony beach you slip into the thigh-deep foam and wade ashore. Night has fallen swiftly, but there is a full moon by which to see. It pierces the darkness and bathes the landscape in its ghostly ashen light. Crouching low, you scurry up the beach, using the boulders as cover as you head towards the base of a sheer cliff wall. You are nearing your goal when the sounds of footsteps and gruff voices stop you dead in your tracks: it is a patrol of Giak soldiers. Drawn from their clifftop encampment, having witnessed the battle at sea, they are searching the water<ch.apos/>s edge for survivors. The tips of their spears glint wetly crimson in the moonlight, alerting you to the fate that has befallen those of Davan<ch.apos/>s crew who managed to swim ashore.</p>

They plan to murder you in retaliation for the death of one of their own, who was poisoned by Ghanesh<ch.apos/>s minions.</p>
       <p>You watch them out of the corner of your eye, and, as soon as they turn away their heads, you hurry into a tunnel that has been avoided by the other passengers. The speed of your action catches the group by surprise; none of them sees which tunnel you take and you escape with ease.</p>

       <p>You hit the water with a mighty splash and sink like a stone beneath the icy waves, yet the shock serves to electrify your senses and you quickly strike out for the surface. You emerge from the depths, coughing and gasping for air, in time to see the enemy ironclad come steaming alongside the blazing <cite>Intrepid</cite>. Its great steel hull passes within a few yards of where you are treading water. Fearful that you could be drowned in its wake, you swim towards it and latch on to the bow as it moves past. The heads of the rivets, which secure its steel skin, offer a handhold for your fingers and enable you to drag yourself on to its deck.</p>
       <p>You have had barely enough time to draw breath when a Drakkar sailor, armed with a billhook, rushes forwards and aims a blow at your head.</p>

       <p>From the crow<ch.apos/>s nest there comes a scream of abject horror. It echoes down the rigging, alerting all to a great scaly head that has broken through the surface twenty yards off the port bow. <quote>Xargath!</quote> The lookout<ch.apos/>s cry is taken up by the crew as, one by one, they glimpse the fearful sight of this legendary terror of the Kaltesee.</p>
       <p><quote>Ishir preserve us!</quote> gasps Captain Borse, as the beast opens its jaws revealing the glitter of its jagged, razor-sharp fangs. For a moment he is stunned by the terrifying sight, but quickly he recovers and begins shouting urgent orders to his awestruck crew. <quote>Man the ballistas! Break out the billhooks! All hands stand by to defend the ship!</quote></p>

       <p>The Xargath observes the commotion in silence, its hooded eyes aglow with baleful green fire as calmly it considers the moment to attack. Then, with an awful suddenness, it rises from the sea, roaring and hissing angrily, and lunges forward. Captain Borse gives the order to fire and a volley of ballista bolts sink into the monster<ch.apos/>s scaly throat. Undeterred, it presses its attack and falls upon the port beam with devastating effect. Tortured timbers bend and crack asunder. In seconds the deck is torn apart by huge claws, each as long as a mammoth<ch.apos/>s tusk. Then the cavernous, fang-filled mouth sweeps down through the fog to snap shut upon the forecastle. Screams of pain and terror fill the air as it withdraws, soaring upward above the masts, jaws bulging with a dozen wriggling bodies. You take cover behind the ship<ch.apos/>s longboat with the captain and prepare to defend yourself as the Xargath returns for a second strike.</p>

       <p>Having completed their task, the engineers pack away their tools and climb down from the work platform that surrounds the orange tank. Patiently, you watch them leave the dry dock before climbing the platform ladder and planting your Crystal Explosive beneath the tank. You prime the device and turn to leave, taking care not to appear anxious or in a hurry, but as you reach the bottom of the ladder you are confronted by three Drakkarim guards, accompanied by a figure dressed in a hooded red robe. Your stomach churns when you glimpse his skeletal face, for the creature is not human<ch.emdash/>you are staring into the ghastly eyes of a Vordak!</p>
       <p>The undead being begins to probe your mind with its psychic power and it shrieks in terror when it discovers who you really are. Instantly, you spring into action, drawing your weapon and striking out at them before they can do likewise. The Vordak drops with its skull shattered and a Drakkar staggers back, clutching desperately at his torn throat. The remaining two, having drawn their blades, now lunge at your chest in unison. You parry their attack with ease and send them both to their doom with one sweeping slice. With the explosive set to detonate at any minute, you run towards the exit, barging aside any who cross your path. You are within ten yards of the dock gates when an alarm bell wails and a troop of Death Knights appear in a line before you. <foreign xml:lang="x-giak"><quote>Koga!</quote></foreign> they command, and raise their spears.</p>
       <p>At that moment there is a blinding flash of white light and suddenly everything seems to be happening in slow motion. You see the Death Knights falling backwards, their cloaks and leather armour sprouting tongues of flame. Buckled steel plates, twisted girders, and the bodies of screaming slaves cartwheel past you, trailing sparks as they tumble like fiery meteors. The heat and the shock of the explosion tears into your back and plunges you head-first into a black, unfeeling oblivion. Your act of sabotage has completely destroyed the ironclad juggernaut, and half of Argazad harbour, but it has cost you your life and sealed the doom of Magnamund.</p>

Apart from the armour (which you need not record on your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>), you discover a number of items that may be of use to you on the road ahead:</p>
       <ul>
        <li>Sword</li>
        <li>Dagger</li>
        <li>Bow</li>
        <li>Quiver</li>
        <li>4 Arrows</li>
        <li>30 Kika (equivalent to 3 Gold Crowns)</li>
       </ul>
       <p>If you decide to keep any of these items, remember to record them on your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
       <p>The dead warrior<ch.apos/>s horse is standing nearby, pawing the ground nervously. Using your innate Kai skill of animal kinship, you succeed in claiming him and making him obey your commands. Slowly he approaches and allows you to climb into the saddle. Once you are sure that you have control you flick your heels and head off at a canter along the trail to Argazad.</p>

       <p>Your Kai senses tell you that he speaks the truth: he is the Slavemaster of Aarnak, and he has recognized the words that identify you as a fellow-agent of the Elder Magi. But the many years he has spent as a servant of the Darklords has taught him to be wary of their subterfuge, and not until you remove your battle-mask and he looks upon your unmistakably Sommlending features does he accept you as genuine. <quote>Long have I waited for this moment,</quote> he says, quietly. <quote>I know why you have come and I will help you all I can.</quote></p>
       <p><quote>But why?</quote> you reply, now suspicious of his true motives. <quote>Why do you desire to betray your masters? Have they not given you the power you crave?</quote></p>
       <p><quote>Aye! That they have, but at a grievous price. Since the war began, they have demanded that the foundries and ore pits of Aarnak produce ever-increasing supplies of black steel. The quotas are impossible and I fear that the day is close when I will be of no more use to them. Ultimately, the Darklords destroy everything over which they have control<ch.emdash/>cities, land, races, even their own kind. The Elder Magi have promised me sanctuary in return for my help, and help I shall, for my life is dependent on your success.</quote> He smiles, amused by the irony of his situation, then he bids you follow him to an adjoining chamber. <quote>Come, you must prepare for your journey to the Black City.</quote></p>

       <p>Cautiously you peer into the abyss, your weapon held ready in case another of the fearsome Ictakko should surge from the depths and attack. But in this instance your caution proves unnecessary, for your senses soon tell you that a colony of cave bats are the only creatures that now occupy the dark and silent crevasse.</p>
       <p>With ease, you leap across the crevasse at its narrowest point and leave the cavern by the tunnel in the opposite wall. Here, too, the walls are encrusted with light-emitting bacteria, enabling you to progress quickly through a series of interconnecting halls and chambers. The cobwebbed remains of broken mining equipment litter many of these places, revealing why the Darklords constructed this labyrinth of tunnels. After an hour of exploration you find the main exit from the mine. Darkness greets your return to the surface, but your senses inform you that you have emerged in the pass that traverses the mountain range.</p>

       <p>With your heart pounding in anticipation, you cast your gaze around the grey granite walls of a subterranean vault: your journey through the Shadow Gate has returned you to the land of your birth. You are standing in the Externment Chamber, a room located deep below the Guildhall of the Crystal Star in Toran. Facing you, and illuminated by the glow of several tall candles, is a line of throne-like seats. Two men, both attired in silken robes, are seated at the centre of the row, their heads bowed and their hands clasped in silent prayer. The sound of your footsteps stirs them from their meditations and, as they raise their heads, you recognize the face of your friend, Banedon, and your tutor, Lord Rimoah, speaker for the High Council of the Elder Magi.</p>

       <p><quote>The gods be praised!</quote> breathes Rimoah, his eyes wide with astonishment. <quote><foreign xml:lang="x-dessi">Skarn</foreign> has returned. The prophecy is fulfilled.</quote></p>
       <p>Slowly they rise and step forward to greet you, their movements hesitant and uncertain, scarcely able to believe that you are alive. Calmly you assure them that they are not dreaming, that you have indeed survived your exile to the Daziarn Plane and have returned, more determined than ever to avenge yourself upon Darklord Gnaag.</p>
       <p>Eagerly Rimoah and Banedon listen as you recount your experiences in the Daziarn and, when you have finished, they tell you what has befallen Magnamund during your absence. Although it seemed that you spent little more than a few days in the Daziarn, more than eight years have passed since Gnaag caused you to fall into the Shadow Gate of Torgar. <quote>He was quick to proclaim your death,</quote> says Banedon, unfurling a map of Northern Magnamund upon the floor of the chamber. <quote>The news came as a terrible blow to us all.</quote></p>
       <p>Lord Rimoah kneels and points at the map, indicating the city of Torgar with the tip of a slender crystal rod. <quote>After your disappearance, Lord Adamas was killed, and the allied armies were quickly ejected from Torgar. Gnaag declared himself invincible, and in the wake of his victory the Darkland defeats were soon halted throughout central Magnamund. A terrible sense of hopelessness befell the allies, which was exploited to the full by the malevolent Gnaag. His sorcerers, the Nadziranim, created devices they call <quote>Tanoz-tukor</quote> to enable each of the Darklords to survive in territories outside their accursed realm. Previously they had been unable to survive beyond the Darklands for any great length of time and, during these rare, brief excursions, their powers were greatly reduced. Now they are able to lead their armies in battle personally, and they have been eager to exercise their newfound freedom.</quote></p>
       <p><quote>The war against the Darklords is all but lost,</quote> continues Banedon, his eyes cast down at the map, which is covered with black markers indicating the frightening number of countries Gnaag has added to his empire. <quote>With the help of our allies in Durenor, Sommerlund has so far resisted his attempts at invasion, but now we find ourselves cut off from Durenor<ch.apos/>s aid by a blockade of Darklord warships. Here,</quote> he says, pointing to the Gulf of Helenag, <quote>is where Gnaag has constructed a huge naval base. It is called Argazad, and it is from here that he launches his fleet of ironclad warships to blockade our coast. The Sommlending navy is no match for these monstrous sea machines, and without the troops, food, and weapons we have been receiving by sea from Durenor, our days are numbered.</quote></p>
       <p>Lord Rimoah rises to his feet and stares fixedly into your eyes. <quote>Your skill, bravery, and your vow to avenge the death of the Kai are the keys to our salvation. Only you, Lone Wolf, can save us now. You are our only hope in this hour of darkness.</quote></p>

At his command the crew spring into action, breaking their backs to coax every last knot of speed from their battered ship, but the winds are against them and the enemy, not reliant on sails for their propulsion, are soon closing the gap.</p>
       <p><quote>Prepare to repel boarders!</quote> shouts Davan, as an ironclad draws alongside. Hastily they abandon their attempt to outrun the enemy, and draw weapons in readiness to receive a unit of leather-clad Drakkarim marines who are poised to spring aboard the very moment the two vessels collide. Then, with a resounding crash, the ironclad smashes into the side of the <cite>Intrepid</cite> and the enemy come scrambling over the rail, screaming and howling like a pack of demons.</p>

       <p>Guided by your instructions, Captain Borse commands his helmsman to steer <quote>hard a<ch.apos/> port</quote>, a manoeuvre that will take the <cite>Intrepid</cite> clear of the enemy line. Swiftly the ship changes course. You watch the Darkland ironclads looming larger with each passing minute, and note the formidable array of weapons aboard their steel-skinned decks. Huge, black funnels protrude from the middle of each craft, which emit clouds of choking, sulphurous smoke. As the <cite>Intrepid</cite> rounds the last ironclad in the line, this acrid smoke wafts across the water and engulfs the crew, causing them to cough and retch violently. The sound of their coughing alerts the enemy lookouts who immediately raise the alarm.</p>

At a junction with two other tunnels your eye is drawn to a large emblem that has been chiselled skilfully out of the granite wall. It is a depiction of a snake<ch.apos/>s skull with two fly-like eyes, surrounded by a circle of fire. At once you recognize this carving: it is the personal emblem of Darklord Gnaag. You study the sign: it must mark the start of a tunnel that leads to the Imperial Sector of the city.</p>
       <p>With your pulse racing, you set off along the torchlit tunnel.

       <p>In daylight, the trail is steep and treacherous, but in the cold, starlit darkness it is doubly so. Chunks of rock crumble underfoot and in many places there is simply no trail at all. Progress can only be made by inching yourself painfully across the sheer drops, using your fingers and what little of the ledge that remains. Eventually you reach the dark opening and enter with trepidation. A smooth, semicircular tunnel descends through the rock. The passage is lit faintly by an eerie ochre light, which is cast by clumps of bacteria that seem to thrive on the damp tunnel walls.</p>

       <p>At once you recognize the pungent aroma of Adgana leaves. Adgana is a powerful narcotic that increases strength and sharpens reflexes; it enhances fighting prowess when swallowed immediately prior to combat. There is sufficient Adgana in this pouch for one dose, which would be enough to increase your <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> by 6 points for the duration of a fight.</p>
       <p>But be warned! Adgana is shunned by most warriors and its use is outlawed in Sommerlund because it is highly addictive. If you choose to keep and use this Dose of Adgana prior to combat, there is a chance that you could become addicted. As soon as combat is resolved, you must pick a number from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a>. If the number you pick is 0 or 1, you have become addicted and your <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> score must be reduced by 4 points immediately. <a id="sect145-1" idref="sect145-1-foot" class="footnote"/> If you have ever used Adgana in a previous <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> adventure, the risks of addiction are doubled should you decide to use this dose (you will become addicted if you pick a 0, 1, 2, or 3 on the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a>). Also, the effects of the narcotic when used on a second or subsequent occasion are halved. You will be able to add only 3 points to your <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ>, instead of 6). If you decide to keep this Dose of Adgana, note the hazardous side effects of its use in the margin of your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
       <p>Sure that you have not overlooked any other items that could aid your perilous mission, you decide the time has come to leave.</p>

       <p><quote>Davan! Quick, have your men cut the grappling lines!</quote> you shout. Immediately he urges his men to carry out your command. Anxiously you watch as the second ironclad bears down on the stern with unnerving speed. The lines are soon severed and you feel the ship swing about, yet the enemy craft is almost upon you, its deck crammed with more troops, poised to leap aboard. Suddenly it hits the rear quarter, and you are knocked down by the shock. The screech of tortured metal and the crack of splintering wood fill the air, yet the deck soon rights itself and you are able to regain control of the helm. Despite the shock of impact and the fearful noise, the enemy craft has only glanced the bow, its steel-tipped ram missing the rudder by just a few feet. It scrapes alongside before veering away amid a cloud of foul, yellow smoke.</p>
       <p>The crew cheer and the Drakkarim marines falter as they watch their vessels slipping away to the stern.

You pull your warm cape close about your shoulders and set off towards a ridge that is peppered with dark hollows. You pray that one of them will offer some shelter from the coming storm.</p>

       <p>Shortly after dawn, a howling wind awakens you from your dreamless slumber. It sweeps along the pass from the west, carrying with it the briny smell of the sea. Resolutely you continue your trek, following the roadway through the pass until, at midday, you emerge from the mountains at a point that commands a clear view over the land beyond. There you stop and stare at an expanse of rocky terrain so fragmented that it might have been smashed by a giant hammer. It slopes down to the shores of a wide inlet<ch.emdash/>the Gulf of Helenag<ch.emdash/>where a line of Darkland ironclads are steaming northwards on their way to join the blockade. From where you are, they appear no larger than tiny black specks dotting the steel-grey sea, but the clouds of yellow smoke that pour from their funnels clearly identify them as enemy ships.</p>
       <p>The track continues, snaking southwards across the barren landscape on its way to Argazad. For three hours you tread its uneven surface until you arrive at what appears to be the ruins of an ancient tower.</p>

       <p><quote>Three months ago, on the day that you Sommlending celebrate your Feast of Fehmarn, I foresaw in a dream your return to this world, the place and the hour of your coming,</quote> says Rimoah, reverently. <quote>I, and all my brothers, held this dream to be a sign from the God Kai that you had not died at Torgar, and since that day we have prepared for your return so that we may help you fulfil your vow and deliver us all from the tyranny of the Darklords. With the aid of Guildmaster Banedon we have conceived a plan that can secure a lasting victory. Defeat of the Darklords on the field of battle is now impossible; the allied armies are greatly outnumbered and are hard-pressed to protect what little remains of the Freelands. The only way in which we can rid ourselves of this evil is by destroying Gnaag and the Transfusor<ch.emdash/>the device that transmits power to the Tanoz-tukor. Both of them are in Helgedad.</quote></p>
       <p>To hear the name of that foul city spoken aloud is enough to send a shiver down your spine, and the thought of daring to venture there to destroy its ruler fills you with cold dread. <quote>It is a daunting task that we ask you to attempt, Lone Wolf,</quote> says Banedon, sensing your anxiety, <quote>but only you have any hope of succeeding in this desperate mission. It may be of some comfort to learn that, with the Darklords leading their armies in the field, the defences of the Black City are now at their weakest. Only Gnaag and his second-in-command, Darklord Taktaal, reside there at present.</quote></p>
       <p><quote>You spoke of a plan?</quote> you say, returning your gaze to the wise face of Lord Rimoah. Without replying, he bends down and pulls out a leather sack from beneath the chair on which he sat when you entered the chamber. It contains what appears to be a mass of triangular crystals that are fused together. At once you recognize its purpose. It is a powerful charge, similar to the one which Lord Adamas used to destroy the Torgar Gate.</p>
       <p><quote>This will put paid to the Transfusor,</quote> says Rimoah, holding up the crystal explosive. He points to a shard that is longer than the others and informs you that the device is activated by withdrawing and re-inserting it tip-first into the core. <quote>It must be placed beneath the Transfusor and it will detonate exactly fifteen minutes after it is primed.</quote> Carefully he replaces the explosive into the sack and offers it to you.</p>
       <p><quote>But how am I to gain entry to Helgedad?</quote> you ask, as you accept the deadly package tentatively.</p>
       <p><quote>We have made preparations,</quote> answers Banedon, pointing once more to the map. <quote>A caravel is anchored in Toran harbour. Under cover of darkness it will run the blockade, then head east to deceive the enemy into thinking that it is bound for Durenor. When safe to do so it will turn about and steer a course for Dejkaata. The shallows there are free of pack-ice at this time of the year and the captain should be able to land you on the coast close to the Aarnak Estuary. From there you must make your way on foot to the stronghold of Aarnak and seek out the Slavemaster. He is one of our agents and can be trusted. Make yourself known to him by saying the words, <quote>Sommerlund is burning</quote>. He alone knows where in Helgedad the Transfusor is located, and he can arrange for your safe and secret passage into the city. Once inside, you must destroy Gnaag and the Transfusor as quickly as possible.</quote></p>
       <p><quote>And once the task is complete, how then do I effect an escape?</quote> you ask.</p>
       <p><quote>You must make your way back to Aarnak. The demise of the Darklords will announce the success of your mission and we shall then mount an expedition to bring you safely home. But until then, no one must know your true identity, or the reason for your journey to Helgedad.</quote></p>
       <p>Silently you contemplate the awesomeness of this mission, its dangers, and the terrible consequences that will befall Magnamund should you fail. At length you raise your eyes from the map and force a smile. <quote>When must I leave?</quote> you ask, bravely.</p>
       <p><quote>Tomorrow night,</quote> Banedon replies. <quote>An hour after sunset.</quote></p>
       <p>Mark the Crystal Explosive on your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a> as a Special hem that you carry strapped to your Backpack. If you already carry the maximum number of Special Items, you must discard one in favour of the Crystal Explosive.</p>

       <p>The tunnel grows darker and dirtier the further down it you venture. You are beginning to suspect that you have entered an abandoned passage when the unmistakable stench of decaying meat wafts past you on a sulphurous breeze. Then two misshapen creatures loom out of the darkness, and your stomach churns at the sight of their hideously swollen faces. Their eyes are slits, the lids sewn down against the putrid flesh of their cheeks by lengths of coarse, black thread. They stagger towards you, their hooked claws scrabbling the air and their long, snake-like tongues flickering from their lipless mouths as hungrily they savour the scent of your flesh.</p>

       <p>Night has fallen swiftly, but there is a full moon by which to see. It pierces the darkness and bathes the landscape in its ghostly, ashen light. The tide bears you swiftly towards a shingle beach that is littered with huge, sea-smoothed boulders. The crashing surf and the screech of predatory seabirds echo all along this barren coastline. It is an unwelcoming sound, cold and hostile, a fitting reflection of the land itself.</p>
       <p>Ten yards from the stony beach, you slip into the thigh-deep foam and wade ashore. Although you can see no sign of enemy patrols, you keep your head low as you scurry up the beach towards the base of a sheer cliff wall. By chance you happen upon a narrow path that clings precariously to the side of the cliff-face as it zigzags its way to the top. The climb is long and arduous, and by the time you reach the summit the weather has taken a turn for the worse. An icy, rain-laden wind whips inland from the sea. Its chilling bite is accompanied by sheet lightning that illuminates the landscape before you. The blue-white flashes reveal a vast, dead world of pitted spurs and crags, where every tree is petrified and every rock looks like a dead man<ch.apos/>s skull. You pull your cape close about your shoulders and set off towards a ridge that is peppered with dark hollows, hoping that one of them will offer some shelter from the coming storm.</p>
       <p>Upon reaching the ridge, you discover that most of the hollows are merely patches of dark earth sandwiched between the honeycombed rock. The rain has become torrential, and you are beginning to abandon all hope of finding dry shelter, when suddenly your tracking instincts alert you to a cave-like opening at the far end of the ridge. You investigate and discover that it is indeed the entrance to a cave, one that is both wind and water tight and, to your relief, quite empty. You are now very hungry and must eat a Meal or lose 3 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points.</p>

Billowing black storm clouds mask the moon and plunge the land into an inky darkness that makes your search for shelter increasingly difficult. Only the steady flash of sheet lightning affords you any assistance. After three hours of fruitless search you resign yourself to spending a cold, wet, and thoroughly miserable night crouching at the bottom of a shallow gully, with your cape pulled tent-like over your head to fend off the relentless rain. Owing to the cold, your fatigue and lack of sleep, your night in the open costs you 4 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points.</p>

       <p>As you follow the sycophantic creature along the corridor and up a flight of iron stairs to the deck level above, you ponder the name he called you<ch.emdash/>Cagath. No doubt it was the name of the Liganim whose identity you have taken on as a disguise. (Make a note of this name in the margin of your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>. It could prove useful at a later stage of your adventure.)</p>
       <p>A strange scene awaits you in the large, cylindrical chamber that is the gallery. At the centre of this steel hall, used by the Lajakeka<ch.apos/>s passengers as a meeting place and gambling den, there is a square pit some fifteen feet deep. On tiered seats that encircle the pit sit a motley group of creatures, some of whose features you recognize: Liganim, Nadziranim, Giak ore-masters, and a dozen or so whose origins are a mystery to you. They are all cheering or bawling obscenities at two bulky pit fighters, who are locked in hand-to-hand combat below. The fight ends abruptly with the beheading of one combatant, and the pit is cleared quickly whilst old bets are claimed and new ones are laid on the next bout. Into the gore-stained pit step two new fighters: an orange-skinned reptilian armed with a spiked club, and a blue-skinned humanoid wielding a ball and chain. Giak crew pass along the tiers collecting bets. One of them appears at your side and tugs your sleeve. <foreign xml:lang="x-giak"><quote>Ak nart gug?</quote></foreign> he growls, waving a wad of orange and blue slips of hide, as he tries to tempt you to place a bet.</p>

       <p>The limb wavers; then, hesitantly, it falls back to the edge of the abyss. With an arrow drawn to your lips you watch it retreat, your eye focused along the shaft at a point near the middle of the velvety black tendril. It continues to withdraw, then, as the tip is about to disappear from sight, there is a deafening screech. Suddenly a huge shape explodes from the crevasse, rising at such speed that its features are a blur. Instinctively you aim at the centre of this bulbous black form, and send your shaft whistling to meet its lightning-fast attack. The arrow strikes, and the creature screeches again<ch.emdash/>this time in pain.</p>
       <p>You dive to the floor to avoid being hit by this howling horror, but it skims your scalp before slamming into the cavern wall. You glance back, expecting to see it slumped lifelessly on the floor, but to your surprise you see that it is still moving. Like a punctured balloon, it rebounds from the wall, then soars in a spiral towards the roof. There it is impaled on a cluster of stalactites that crack and give way under the impact of its vast weight. For a fleeting second you glimpse its ghastly features<ch.emdash/>its pear-shaped horny head and bulb-tipped antennae<ch.emdash/>before it plummets for the last time into the coal-black depths of the crevasse.</p>

As your vision clears, to your horror you see Kraagensk<ch.ucirc/>l bending over a bowl that rests on a plinth beside his throne. It is filled with a silvery liquid, and at once you recognize its purpose: it is a communicator, a device through which he can converse with his leader, Darklord Gnaag. The Sommerswerd has betrayed your identity, and Kraagensk<ch.ucirc/>l is warning Gnaag of your presence here in Argazad.</p>

       <p>The track and the stream wind their way towards a narrow gap in the Durncrag Range. Fixedly you stare at this gap. The longer you gaze, the more certain you are that it is a mountain pass, allowing the path to continue through to Argazad. You decide to press on and traverse the pass. Hopefully, the track will lead to the naval base where you can attempt to steal, or stow away on, some means of transport that will carry you to Aarnak. The naval base must receive equipment from a Darkland city-fortress, and it is likely that Aarnak is one such source of supply.</p>
       <p>It is nearly dusk when the stony path reaches the narrow, boulder-strewn approach to the pass. It has been a long and tiring trek, yet in spite of your fatigue your senses warn you in good time of the danger that lies ahead. The pass is blocked by a wall and a stone watchtower, both guarded by Giak soldiers. Carefully you leave the path and creep along the bank of the stream, remaining hidden from view as slowly you edge your way nearer to the Giak outpost. An iron-banded gate in the centre of the wall allows traffic to use the pass, but it is closed and guarded by sentries. As dusk turns to darkness, you continue to observe every detail of the outpost and the surrounding mountains, in the hope of finding a way through.</p>

In the middle of each one is a pyramid of stone, festooned with chains, to which are manacled a dozen wretched creatures.

       <p>It is nearing the hour of sunset when you set eyes on the naval base of Argazad. <a id="sect200-1" idref="sect200-1-foot" class="footnote"/> It nestles in the curve of a cliff<ch.emdash/>a natural harbour, protected from the pounding waters of the Helenag by a long promontory of rock. This wall-like barrier serves as a quay for more than fifty ironclad warships, the evil armada that is slowly strangling your country. Along the quay, huddled in the shadow of the surrounding cliffs, are a host of grim grey buildings, newly constructed from iron and stone. Their greasy windows flare with the orange light of fires that roar within, warming the Drakkarim sailors and marines who crew the Darklands<ch.apos/> fleet.</p>
       <p>Before entering the base, the trail joins a highway that approaches Argazad from the south. You stop to consult your <a idref="map">map</a> and discover that this road leads to the city-fortresses of Kaag and Aarnak. You consider avoiding the naval base and riding to Aarnak, but soon dismiss the idea. The journey would take you across the Naogizaga, one of the most desolate wastelands in all of Magnamund. Even if you could survive the heat, the dust, and the hellish creatures that dominate that grey desert, your mount would be sure to perish for lack of food and water.</p>

You fight valiantly, and slay many before you are eventually overwhelmed and taken in chains before Darklord Gnaag.

       <p>On a throne of hewn granite, ringed by seven pillars of fire, sits a being whose form radiates pure evil. A loose grey robe shrouds his skeletal frame. It is drawn closely about a stringy throat that swells and shrinks repulsively as he sucks the sulphurous air. With a claw-like finger, he scrapes nervously at the blistered flesh that is stretched tightly across the swollen left side of his face, attempting in vain to hook the head of a snake-like parasite that has burrowed into his jaw. His eyes, deep-sunken and red-rimmed with the unbearable pain of his affliction, burn with sick fanaticism as he listens impatiently to the pleas and excuses being offered by two who stand before him<ch.emdash/>the man in red and one other, both humbly bowed.</p>
       <p>The luckless mortals plead their case, speaking in the Vassagonian tongue<ch.emdash/>a language that you mastered long ago. They speak of delays in the construction of a mighty battleship, of shortages of material and of too little time in which to finish their work. Their words anger the seated one.

       <p>Fired by his own rage, the corpse-like Darklord Kraagensk<ch.ucirc/>l, rises from his throne and draws the sword that hangs sheathed at his side. The blade is unlike any that you have seen. It is wholly black, a black so dense that it appears entirely separate from the hilt, like a tear through which you glimpse the nightmare depths of space. He levels the sword at the cowering men to reinforce his threat, but the blade rebels. It twists in his hand and points accusingly at the place where you are hiding. The Darklord narrows his feral eyes and a wave of psychic shock buffets your mind.</p>

       <p>While you languish in the cell, the Death Knight sergeant conveys your equipment to his commander, Darklord Kraagensk<ch.ucirc/>l. At once he recognizes their origins and deduces your true identity. Word is sent to Gnaag, and within the space of four short hours he journeys to the naval base from the city of Helgedad. He orders you to be executed at the earliest opportunity and demands, on pain of death, that the task be accomplished successfully.</p>
       <p>It is Darklord Kraagensk<ch.ucirc/>l who suggests the method for your execution, and the irony of it appeals greatly to his master. At dawn, the Crystal Explosive that you had intended to use in Helgedad, is placed next to the door of the cell. The barracks are evacuated and the explosive is primed. Fifteen minutes later, your life and your mission are brought to an abrupt and final end.</p>

You see a wagon laden with barrels and boxes, and drawn by six ox-like creatures. Two Giaks are sitting on top of the wagon: the driver, who is lashing the team with a whip, and a guard, who appears to be fast asleep. Behind the wagon are four horsemen<ch.emdash/>Drakkarim escorts, judging by their size and the cut of their black leather armour.</p>
       <p>Their route will take them close to where you are sheltering. Mindful of the Giak ability to see in the dark, you decide to stay in hiding and wait for them to pass.</p>

       <p>All the bets are quickly placed and the pit-master prepares to start the proceedings, but the fight is over almost as soon as it begins. Without waiting for the pit-master to hammer the gong that signifies the start of combat, the orange-skinned fighter springs across the pit and buries its spiked club between the startled eyes of its opponent, killing him instantly. The crowd hoots with glee at the beast<ch.apos/>s display of low cunning, and, despite some loud protests by those who bet on the humanoid, the pit-master reluctantly declares the reptilian the winner.</p>
       <p>Bets are about to be placed on the next round of combat when a loud, intermittent whistle interrupts the preliminaries: it is the signal that Helgedad has been sighted by the lookout. Some of the crowd leave their seats in order to view the Black City through the tiny portholes that line the walls of the gallery. With your heart pounding at the thought of seeing the Darkland<ch.apos/>s most infamous stronghold for the first time, you leave the pit and join them.</p>

He takes you to the outskirts of Aarnak in his personal chariot, to a vast, open-cast quarry. The means of your transportation to Helgedad waits at the edge of the quarry<ch.apos/>s vast crater. Your jaw opens in amazement when you set eyes on the vehicle, for it is gigantic, by far the largest vehicle you have ever seen on dry land.</p>

       <p>As if in answer to your plea, the pain disappears. But your fear remains and grows deeper as you stare into the merciless eyes of Darklord Kraagensk<ch.ucirc/>l.</p>

A large, low-ceiling room lies beyond, filled with colossal tanks of glass that bubble and seethe with all manner of sorcerous fluids. Glass tubes loop and contort in curious shapes, connecting the tanks and enabling their contents to flow from one to another. The air is heavy with the stench of acids and harsh chemicals, and the walls are lined from ceiling to floor with stoppered jars, each one filled with a brightly coloured powder, liquid or gas.</p>

       <p>As you enter the harbour square, you pass a line of wagons laden with heavy machinery, which are queueing to enter a dry dock. There, illuminated by the glare of huge oil lamps, is the largest ship you have ever seen<ch.emdash/>a monstrous ironclad juggernaut bristling with awesome weaponry. You stop to stare at this terrifying vessel, and overhear two Drakkarim engineers talking about their work. Your blood runs cold when you hear one of them reveal why this juggernaut is being built. It is to be used to destroy Holmgard, your country<ch.apos/>s capital city.</p>

       <p>Having satisfied yourself that you have overlooked no items of use, you decide to make your way to the heart of Aarnak. Your trek takes you into a maze of garbage-choked streets lined with rusting tenements and squalid huts. Hordes of slaves move to and fro, their backs bent by years of heavy labour. As you turn a corner you are confronted by a procession of these sad creatures, led by a squad of Giaks.</p>
       <p>The leader, a squat Giak sergeant wearing a doomwolf pelt, commands you to halt. Drakkarim are rare visitors to Aarnak, the human constitution being ill-suited to the hostile atmosphere, so the sight of you walking unescorted through the city streets, clad in Drakkarim armour, stirs his deepest suspicions. You continue walking, and immediately he raises his clawed hand<ch.emdash/>it is a signal to his squad to advance and surround you. You turn to run, but when you see that all the Giak soldiers are armed with bows, discretion prompts you to try a different tactic. Boldly you demand that the sergeant take you to the Slavemaster and, to your relief, he agrees.</p>
       <p>The sergeant, and a handful of his troops, take you towards the centre of the city, to a solitary tower standing in the middle of an open square. It is a curious building, tall and unbent, its surface free from any sign of decay. The sergeant speaks with another who guards its open entrance and immediately he stands aside, allowing you to enter the tower<ch.apos/>s gloomy ground floor.</p>

The rain has ceased but the cold wind still blows strongly, bringing patches of frost that whiten the stony soil. You check your equipment and take stock of your provisions before setting off towards a distant line of hills.

       <p>It is nearly noon when finally you reach the top of the ridge and stare down at the valley that lies beyond. It is a barren landscape of endless pits and crags, jagged boulders and scree. A rough, foot-worn track follows a stream that winds its way back to its source, deep among a towering range of mountains that dominates the horizon. Using your <a idref="map">map</a> and your Kai tracking and hunting skills, you conclude that the mountains are the northwestern tip of the Durncrag Range. Beyond them must lie the Gulf of Helenag and the Darklord naval base of Argazad. A feeling of dread overwhelms you as you realize that more than 300 miles of hostile terrain lie between you and Aarnak, the stronghold where you are to rendezvous with the Slavemaster. Silently you stare at the forbidding mountains and rack your brains for a solution to your predicament. At length, you formulate a new plan of action.</p>

       <p>Fortunately, because they are deep inside their own territory, the Drakkarim do not bother to inspect their surroundings and your presence goes undetected. You listen intently to their conversations but discover little useful information except that they are from Argazad and are on their way to the outpost at the mouth of the Durncrag Pass. After eating, they settle down to a session of gambling. They have been playing for only a few minutes when one of the Drakkarim is accused of cheating. A violent argument breaks out and bloodshed is averted only when their commander, a sergeant, steps in to break it up. He finds a fistful of cards wedged up the accused Drakkar<ch.apos/>s sleeve. Angrily, he denounces the cheat and orders him to return to Argazad at first light. The game is brought to a close, and, as the disgruntled Drakkarim get ready to sleep, a bold plan springs into your mind that could make your journey through the Darklands and your entry into Argazad much easier.</p>

       <p>The tales and legends of the northern seas tell of the Xargath, a fearsome breed of giant reptilian sea creature that inhabits the black depths of the Kaltesee. Once, a century ago, the fishermen of Sommerlund trawled these waters and grew rich on the fruits of their labours, for the sea carp were plentiful and the markets of Sommerlund and Durenor paid highly for their catch. Trade thrived until the Xargath appeared and began to attack their boats. So devastating were the attacks, and so terrifying were the descriptions of the Xargath by those fortunate few who survived them, that all fishing in these waters was abandoned and has never been resumed.</p>
       <p>A swarm of sea carp, as huge as that which now surrounds the <cite>Intrepid</cite>, is sure to attract a hungry Xargath. You turn to look for the captain, to warn him of the danger his ship is in, when suddenly the shoal cease their thrashing and fall silent and still.</p>

       <p>The Death Knight, silhouetted by the glow of the harbour lights, presents you with an easy target. Silently, you draw an arrow to your lips and send it burrowing deep between the plates of black steel that protect his spine. He stiffens, then collapses in a heap by the parapet wall.

       <p>Three times you struck a blow and three times a Giak heart beat its last. Now, without pausing even to catch your breath, you take off along the trail and begin the steep climb towards the cliff top. Angry shouts and curses echo in your wake, alerting another party of Giaks on the cliffs above to your presence. They race to the end of the trail and await your appearance, determined to catch you and then kill you at their leisure. You sense the danger and leave the steep trail at the first opportunity. You wait for your pursuers to pass, then double back to the beach. By the time the Giaks realize that you are no longer climbing the trail, it is too late for them to catch up; you are on the beach, more than a mile away to the north.</p>

He falls, yet as he does so, his withered frame vanishes before your eyes. A tattered grey robe and a flickering black sword are all that mark the place where his doom was sealed.</p>
       <p>Quickly you leave the chamber by a stair that leads to the roof. The Zlanbeast, Kraagensk<ch.ucirc/>l<ch.apos/>s personal winged mount, sniffs the air and shuffles along its perch with a nervous, rolling gait. It senses that you are its natural enemy and it is determined to resist your attempts to subdue it. More than an hour elapses before you have control over the creature, and can climb into the saddle without it trying frantically to hook and gouge you with its great curved claws. You pull on the reins and urge the beast skywards, eager to leave this port of evil, but no sooner has it cleared the roof than you are engulfed by a squadron of screeching Kraan swooping down from the night sky. They have flown all the way from Kaag, a Darkland fortress to the south, after being alerted to your presence here by Darklord Gnaag. Valiantly you fight to defend your life, but the odds are overwhelmingly against you. The Kraan drag you from your saddle and you meet your doom upon the hard, unyielding cobblestones of Argazad harbour.</p>

A passage at the far end of the hall takes you past a barracks-like room where Nadziranim sorcerers are busily engaged in the testing of new psychic weapons upon a group of grey-skinned slaves, mindless Grolth from the swamps of the Tadatizaga. Their pitiful screams of agony make your blood run cold, yet you dare not intervene to prevent their torture for fear of jeopardizing your mission. Hurriedly you climb a staircase that emerges at the foot of a monstrous tower, as black as death itself. Two fireballs split open the rolling black clouds and in the brilliance of their explosions you see a huge metallic flag flying from the tower<ch.apos/>s crystal spire. It is emblazoned with the emblem of Darklord Gnaag, and at once you know that you have found what you are looking for: the Tower of the Damned.</p>

       <p>As your eyes move down the tower, you notice a large oval platform jutting out from the black steel wall. Perched on this platform is an Imperial Zlanbeast, similar to the one that bore you to Aarnak. It, too, bears Gnaag<ch.apos/>s sign, branded deep in its leathery hide. Its presence suggests that its master is in residence, and as you cross the courtyard and walk towards the tower door, your senses tingle in anticipation of the confrontation that awaits you within.</p>
       <p>As you climb the steps that lead to the door, it slides open to reveal the outline of a guard silhouetted against a background of scarlet fire. In a claw-tipped hand he holds several slivers of crystal, each a different colour, and, as you reach the top of the steps, he draws a silvery-grey one and points it at your face. <quote>State your name, minion of Ghanesh!</quote> he commands, <quote>or begone from the Tower of the Damned.</quote></p>
       <p>You sense that the guard does not suspect you of being an impostor, he is merely performing a routine check on all who visit the tower. To have come this far into the Imperial Sector means that you have passed through several checkpoints already, and so the guard does not regard you as a threat to his master<ch.apos/>s safety. In order to be allowed to pass, you must state the name of the Liganim whose identity and robe you are using as a disguise.</p>

The demise of the Shianti heralded the rise of the Darklords in Northern Magnamund, and the beginning of the War of Desecration in which the Nebora, and many other races, were exterminated. This ruined tower is all that remains of the wondrous city of Neboran where, in the year MS3250, the entire Nebora race were trapped and slaughtered by the Darklords of Helgedad.</p>

       <p>With trepidation, you peer through the thick and grimy glass of a hull porthole and gaze upon the awesome spectacle that is Helgedad. Perched upon an isle of granite at the centre of a vast, fiery chasm stands the mighty city-fortress, the very core of a cancer that threatens to infect and destroy all that is good in Magnamund. Great walls of black steel encircle it, giving rise to a thousand spiky towers and turrets which harbour the masters and the minions of darkness. Above the city hovers a seething pall of black smoke that keeps it forever in shadow. Fed by the fumes from the volcanic craters of the Naogizaga, this cloud is made all the more noisome by the foul discharges of the Nadziranim laboratories, the weapon furnaces, and the hellish breeding pits at the base of the chasm.</p>

They spin and soar above the city like demonic meteors, before exploding or simply melting away in a rain of sparks. A bridge of twisted black steel joins Helgedad to the wastelands beyond, and as the Lajakeka slowly grinds its way across this span, you look down into the fiery depths of the Nengud-kor-Adez, the Lake of Blood, and your courage quails at the terrible sight that meets your gaze.</p>

With the port side still holed and storms a constant threat in the open reaches of the Kaltesee, it has been decided that the safest course to steer is towards the coast. Then, should a sudden squall threaten, or a gale arise, the ship could run to shelter in one of the hundreds of coves that indent the rugged shore east of Point Vashna. However, to sail along this stretch of coastline is to risk hazards that could prove as dangerous as any storm. Darkland ironclads, unstable in high seas, favour the coast when venturing to and from their base at Argazad, and the cliffs and shores themselves are peppered with watchtowers and Giak encampments.</p>
       <p>By early afternoon the fog has cleared and the <cite>Intrepid</cite> is making good headway through the cold, sparkling waves. League after glittering league fall away to the stern until, an hour or two before sunset, the lookout catches sight of the coast. <quote>Land ahoy!</quote> he calls. <quote>Land afore the bow!</quote> The crew are cheered by the news, feeling safer now that they are within sight of land, but their spirits are soon dampened when the lookout calls out again, this time in alarm. <quote>Enemy off the starboard bow!</quote></p>

       <p>Your lightning reactions save you from being hit by the heavy boom but you cannot avoid the burning canvas. In a matter of seconds you are completely engulfed in an envelope of fire and smoke. Instinctively, you fight to free yourself, then suddenly you realize that your clothes are unaffected by the blaze, and that the tongues of fire licking your hands and face cause you no pain whatsoever. Without haste or urgency you cast aside the blazing sailcloth and emerge completely unscathed.</p>

       <p>Once the creature accepts you as its new master, it becomes totally obedient to your commands.

       <p>A great cloud of dust and debris billows from the gaping hole, and as it slowly begins to clear, you see that most of the enemy warriors have been swallowed up by the collapsing deck. Beyond the hole you glimpse Davan, with a handful of the crew, defending the stern deck against an attacking swarm of Drakkarim, who outnumber them by at least two to one. Then you realize the enemy plan: if they can capture the helm they will be able to steer the <cite>Intrepid</cite> towards the coast and beach her in the shallows.</p>
       <p>Quickly you climb into the rigging and swing across to the stern deck by means of a trailing rope. Davan sees you and gives a cheer as you jump from the rope and land among the enemy. You unsheathe your weapon and begin cleaving a path towards your beleaguered allies, who shout encouragement as you draw nearer. <quote>For Sommerlund!</quote> you cry, and they take up your battle call.

       <p>The Giak groans and clutches at his wounds as he staggers backwards and crashes down upon the barrels and cases. Curious to discover what they are transporting, you roll his body aside, prise open the largest crate, and rummage through the contents. It is filled with Giak and Drakkarim uniforms, enough to dress a hundred troops. The other cases contain an assortment of weapons and other military equipment, and the barrels are full of a wine too foul to even think of tasting. Then an idea springs to mind, an idea that could make your passage through the Darklands much easier and greatly increase the chances for your mission<ch.apos/>s success.</p>

With a chilling caw, it darts towards you, determined to exact its revenge for the death of its mate.</p>

       <p>Only a circle of fire-scorched steel marks the spot where Darklord Gnaag finally met his doom. You look upon this patch of twisted metal and your spirits soar with the realization that you have defeated your arch-enemy in mortal combat. But your mission is yet to be completed. Quickly you remove the Crystal Explosive from your Backpack and approach the Transfusor. You place it in position, next to a shaft connected to the Lake of Blood from which the device draws its power. Once the crystal is primed, you hurry out of the chamber through the archway by which Gnaag entered. Guided by your instincts, you find your way around the tower to the oval landing platform, and to the means of escape from the Black City which awaits you there<ch.emdash/>Gnaag<ch.apos/>s Imperial Zlanbeast.</p>
       <p>You are high above the city, steering the reluctant Zlanbeast eastwards to Aarnak, when the crystal detonates. Within moments it starts a chain reaction, which destroys the Transfusor, reduces Helgedad to a fiery holocaust of shattered granite and twisted steel, and brings about the rapid demise of the Darklords and their armies scattered throughout Magnamund.</p>
       <p>Your victory is total. At last you have fulfilled your destiny to avenge the Kai and rid your land of the evil that has threatened her for thousands of years. You return to Sommerlund a conquering hero, and, as Kai Grand Master, you begin the task of restoring the Kai to their former glory. The chronicle of your struggle against the Darklords will pass into legend, inspiring future generations of Kai warriors to keep alive your ideals of bravery, skill and selfless courage. Yet the saga that is the story of your life does not end here. In future times the chronicle will tell of the adventures you undertook during your Kai Grand Mastership. Until the time comes for their telling, may the Gods Ishir and Kai watch over you, Grand Master Lone Wolf, hero and saviour of Sommerlund.<a id="sect350-1" idref="sect350-1-foot" class="footnote" /></p>

     <p>(<a idref="sect5">Section 5</a>) Be aware that these choices originally read <quote>three rounds or less<ch.ellips/></quote> and <quote>longer than four rounds<ch.ellips/></quote>. We<ch.apos/>ve arbitrarily changed the first choice to read <quote>four rounds or less<ch.ellips/></quote>, erring in the reader<ch.apos/>s favour.</p>
     <p>(<a idref="sect61">Section 61</a>) Crowns or Lune may not be used in lieu of Kika in this instance.</p>
     <p>(<a idref="sect75">Section 75</a>) <cite>Lone Wolf Club Newsletter</cite> clarifies: <quote>Although the Sommerswerd has been drawn and used within the Darklands, you were able to use it to destroy Kraagensk<ch.ucirc/>l before he could make use of the communicator to inform Gnaag of your presence. The port of Argazad is on the fringe of the Darklands and, because of its remote location, your unsheathing of the Sommerswerd did not directly alert Gnaag in Helgedad. The Sommerswerd combat with Kraagensk<ch.ucirc/>l was true to Rimoah<ch.apos/>s warning (<a idref="sect282">Section 282</a>); it did alert him to your presence and betrayed your true identity.</quote></p>
     <p>(<a idref="sect145">Section 145</a>)This loss of <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> is permanent (cf. <bookref series="lw" book="07cd"><cite>Castle Death</cite></bookref> <bookref series="lw" book="07cd" section="sect129">Section 129</bookref>).</p>
     <p>(<a idref="sect159">Section 159</a>) The Bronin Vest may be worn with a Padded Leather Waistcoat, but not with a Chainmail Waistcoat.</p>
     <p>(<a idref="sect162">Section 162</a>) Crowns or Lune may not be used in lieu of Kika in this instance.</p>
     <p>(<a idref="sect179">Section 179</a>) You may still risk taking the Black Cube if you wish.</p>
     <p>(<a idref="sect184">Section 184</a>) Crowns or Lune may not be used in lieu of Kika in this instance.</p>
     <p>(<a idref="sect187">Section 187</a>) The Zejar-dulaga occupies the same space in your Quiver as a normal Arrow. If you have 6 Arrows, you may discard one in favour of the Zejar-dulaga.</p>
     <p>(<a idref="sect200">Section 200</a>) If you only possess the Kai Discipline of Hunting<ch.emdash/>not Huntmastery<ch.emdash/>you may no longer hunt for food as you venture deeper into the Darklands.</p>
     <p>(<a idref="sect221">Section 221</a>) Crowns or Lune may not be used in lieu of Kika in this instance.</p>
     <p>(<a idref="sect268">Section 268</a>) It is possible that your permanent <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> score might fall to zero or below due to the Sea-scavenger<ch.apos/>s attack, but you may be wearing a piece of armour that gives you an <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> point bonus. This would leave you with a permanent <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> score of 0 with a current <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> score still above zero. If your basic <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> score is reduced to zero or below, you are dead and your adventure is over.</p>
     <p>(<a idref="sect350">Section 350</a>) The next book in the <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> series is entitled <bookref series="lw" book="13tplor"><cite>The Plague Lords of Ruel</cite></bookref>.</p>
     <p>(<a idref="crsumary">Combat Rules Summary</a>) Replaced <quote>cross reference</quote> with <quote>cross-reference</quote>, <quote>top of chart</quote> with <quote>top of the chart</quote> and <quote>fall to 0</quote> with <quote>falls to 0 or below</quote>. Replaced <quote>Kai Disciplines</quote> with <quote>Magnakai Disciplines</quote>.</p>
