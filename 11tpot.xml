  <p>Swiftly you draw the broadsword over your head and take aim at the Chaos-master<ch.apos/>s heart, yet even as you make your lunge he catches sight of you and twists to avoid your thrust. The sharp blade opens a fearful gash in his side but it misses its vital target. With a roar of agony the evil god staggers back, dropping his club as he clasps his side. Pain swiftly turns to a rage that fills him with a lust for vengeance and, with a hideous scream, he lunges at you with his gore-stained hands.<ch.ellips/></p>

    <p>You are the warrior, Lone Wolf, last of the Kai masters of Sommerlund and sole survivor of the massacre that destroyed your kinsmen during a bitter war with your age-old enemies<ch.emdash/>the Darklords of Helgedad.</p>
    <p> Many centuries have passed since Sun Eagle, the first of your kind, established the Order of the Kai. Aided by the magicians of Dessi, he completed a perilous quest to find seven crystals of power known as the Lorestones of Nyxator, and upon their discovery he unlocked a wisdom and strength that lay within both the Lorestones and himself. He recorded the nature of his discoveries and his experiences in a great tome entitled The Book of the Magnakai. You have discovered this lost Kai treasure and have given a solemn pledge to restore the Kai to their former glory, thereby ensuring the security of your land in the years to come. However, your diligent study of this ancient book has enabled you to master only three of the ten Magnakai Disciplines. To fulfil your pledge, you must complete the quest first undertaken by Sun Eagle over a thousand years ago. By doing so successfully, you, too, will acquire the power and wisdom of the Magnakai, which is held within the Lorestones<ch.apos/> crystal forms.</p>
    <p>Already your quest has taken you far from your northern homeland. Following in the footsteps of the first Kai Grand Master, you journeyed to Dessi and sought the help of the Elder Magi, the magicians who aided Sun Eagle on his quest long ago. There you learned that for centuries the Elder Magi had awaited your coming. An ancient Dessi legend tells of the birth and rise to greatness of two <foreign xml:lang="x-dessi">koura-tas-kai</foreign>, which means <quote>sons of the sun</quote>. One was named <foreign xml:lang="x-dessi">Ikar</foreign>, which means <quote>eagle</quote>, and the other was named <foreign xml:lang="x-dessi">Skarn</foreign>, which means <quote>wolf</quote>. A prophecy foretold that the <foreign xml:lang="x-dessi">koura-tas-kai</foreign> would each come from the north to seek the counsel of the Elder Magi in order that they might fulfil a great quest. Although separated by several centuries, they would share one spirit, one purpose and one destiny<ch.emdash/>to triumph over the champions of darkness in an age of great peril. The Elder Magi knew that you were <foreign xml:lang="x-dessi">Skarn</foreign><ch.emdash/>the wolf of Dessi legend<ch.emdash/>and in keeping with their ancient vows they promised to help you complete the Magnakai quest.</p>
    <p>In Elzian, the capital of Dessi, you were tutored in the histories of Magnamund and received lessons in lore that you would have learned from the Kai masters if only they, like you, had survived the murderous Darklord attack on the Kai Monastery twelve years ago. You were eager to learn all that your tutor, Lord Rimoah, could teach you in preparation for the next stage of your quest, but grim news from the Darklands cut short your tuition. In the Darklord city of Helgedad a civil war had erupted, following your defeat of Haakon, Archlord of the Black City. After five years, the battle for the throne of Helgedad had finally been won by a Darklord called Gnaag. The other Darklords, now united behind this new leader, were ordered to amass huge armies in preparation for the conquest of Magnamund. Swiftly their Giak legions grew in number, enabling Gnaag to launch a sweeping invasion that was to catch the freelands unprepared. Many countries were completely overrun by Darklord armies; others surrendered without fighting, and sadly there were those who chose to betray former friends and allies by joining the Darklord cause, in the misguided hope that they would share in the spoils of victory, following the triumph of Darklord Gnaag. One such land was Vassagonia, a powerful desert realm to the north of Dessi. It mobilized its formidable army and marched west to join Gnaag<ch.apos/>s horde as it steamrollered across central Magnamund. They were destined to meet at the city of Tahou where, beneath the ancient streets, lay hidden one of the seven Lorestones of Nyxator. You set off in haste for Tahou and arrived barely hours ahead of the enemy. Successfully you made your descent and discovered the object of your quest, but on returning to the surface you found Tahou transformed into a blazing inferno. Darklord Gnaag and Zakhan Kimah, the cruel ruler of Vassagonia, had learnt of your presence and were determined to destroy you at all costs. For days their engines of war had hurled fire and rock across the walls of Tahou with devastating effect. Then a massive assault, led by the Zakhan himself, breached the city gate and gained entry to the burning capital. Armed with a weapon of awesome power, the evil Zakhan sought you out and challenged you to a fight to the death. The struggle was desperate but you emerged victorious and led the Anarians in a counterattack that cleared the city of the invading foe. The allies of Anari arrived to raise the siege and in the ensuing battle the demoralized armies of Gnaag and Kimah were smashed and routed.</p>
    <p> Your defeat of Zakhan Kimah turned the tide of war decisively against the Darklord armies and paved the way for the liberation of the lands they had taken by force. But the sweet taste of victory turned sour when you discovered that Darklord Gnaag had captured the last three remaining Lorestones of Nyxator, and had vowed to avenge his defeat by destroying them and killing you. Alarmed by this, the High Council of the Elder Magi joined you in Tahou to help formulate a plan of action. They had already received word from Prince Graygor, the ruler of Eru, that three radiant gems filled with golden light had been transported to the fortress of Torgar from the Darklord city of Mozg<ch.ocirc/>ar. Unable to tolerate the goodly power of the Lorestones within his own domain, Gnaag had been forced to move them to Torgar where his sorcerers<ch.emdash/>the Nadziranim<ch.emdash/>set about searching for a means to destroy them. Fearing that they might achieve their task, the Elder Magi made preparations for your secret journey to Eru and, in order to safeguard your true identity, you adopted the guise of a Pathfinder<ch.emdash/>one of Prince Graygor<ch.apos/>s <ch.eacute/>lite woodland scouts.</p>
    <p>After a long and perilous journey you arrived at Torgar to find it besieged by the armies of Talestria and Palmyrion. During the early months of the Darklord invasion, hundreds of Talestrians were enslaved and sent to labour in the dungeons and sulphur mines deep within the bowels of this grim city-fortress. Their plight seemed hopeless until the allied armies, under the command of Lord Adamas of Garthen, finally arrived to liberate them. Due in part to your bravery and skill during the assault, Lord Adamas<ch.apos/>s troops were able to breach the great Torgar gate and storm its citadel. During this fierce battle you gained entry to the chamber at the heart of the citadel where the Nadziranim were attempting to destroy the Lorestones. They were hung above a circular black pit and suspended in a fireball of negative energy, the focal point of several beams of power emanating from crystals set around the edge of the pit. By means of a gantry you were able to climb above these energy beams and retrieve one of the Lorestones. But, as you reached out for the remaining two, a terrible voice filled the chamber.</p>
    <p><quote>Vengeance is mine, Lone Wolf!</quote> Terror struck deep in your heart as you turned and saw the ghastly form of Darklord Gnaag. A rasping laugh echoed from his fly-like head as he raised a black crystal and pointed it at the gantry. <quote>The vow I gave at Tahou shall be fulfilled. Now I shall destroy you and the Lorestones!</quote> he gloated.</p>
    <p>There was a deafening crack and a bolt of blue lightning leapt from the stone towards the rusty iron gantry. As the shock wave hit the fireball the two remaining Lorestones were sent tumbling into the black abyss. A second bolt ripped the gantry in two and, with the ghastly laugh of Darklord Gnaag ringing in your ears, you fell headlong into a portal of total darkness, a Shadow Gate which leads to the twilight world of the Daziarn Plane.</p>

    <p>You keep a record of your adventure on the <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
    <p>During your training as a Kai Master you have developed fighting prowess<ch.emdash/><typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> and physical stamina<ch.emdash/><typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ>. Before you set off on your adventure you need to measure how effective your training has been. To do this take a pencil and, with your eyes closed, point with the blunt end of it on to the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a>. If you pick 0 it counts as zero.</p>
    <p>The first number that you pick from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> in this way represents your <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ>. Add 10 to the number you picked and write the total in the <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> section of your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>. (i.e. if your pencil fell on the number 4 in the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> you would write in a <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> of 14.) When you fight, your <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> will be pitted against that of your enemy. A high score in this section is therefore very desirable.</p>
    <p>The second number that you pick from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> represents your powers of <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ>. Add 20 to this number and write the total in the <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> section of your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>. (i.e. if your pencil fell on the number 6 on the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> you would have 26 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points.)</p>
    <p>If you are wounded in combat you will lose <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points. If at any time your <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points fall to zero or below, you are dead and the adventure is over. Lost <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points can be regained during the course of the adventure, but your number of <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points can never rise above the number you started with.</p>
    <p><strong>If you have successfully completed any of the previous adventures in the <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> series</strong>, you can carry your current scores of <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> and <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points over to Book 11. You may also carry over any Weapons and Special Items you have in your possession at the end of your last adventure, and these should be entered on your new <a idref="action">Action Chart</a> (you are still limited to two Weapons and eight Backpack Items).</p>
    <p>You many choose one bonus <a idref="discplnz">Magnakai Discipline</a> to add to your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a> for every <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> Magnakai adventure you successfully complete (Books 6<ch.endash/>12).</p>

      <p>During your training as a Kai Lord, and in the course of the adventures that led to the discovery of <cite>The Book of the Magnakai</cite>, you have mastered all ten of the basic warrior skills known as the Kai Disciplines.</p>
      <p>After studying <cite>The Book of the Magnakai</cite>, you have also reached the rank of Kai Master Superior, which means that you have learnt <em>three</em> of the Magnakai Disciplines listed below. It is up to you to choose which three skills these are. As all of the Magnakai Disciplines will be of use to you at some point on your adventure, pick your three with care. The correct use of a Magnakai Discipline at the right time can save your life.</p>
      <p>The Magnakai skills are divided into groups, each of which is governed by a separate school of training. These groups are called <quote>Lore-circles</quote>. By mastering all of the Magnakai Disciplines in a particular Lore-circle, you can gain an increase in your <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> and <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points score. (See the section <quote><a idref="lorecrcl">Lore-circles of the Magnakai</a></quote> for details of these bonuses.)</p>
      <p>When you have chosen your three Magnakai Disciplines, enter them in the Magnakai Disciplines section of your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>.</p>

When you enter combat with a weapon you have mastered, you add 3 points to your <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ>. The rank of Kai Master Superior, with which you begin the Magnakai series, means you are skilled in <em>three</em> of the weapons in the list below.</p>

        <p>It is a powerful Discipline, but it is also a costly one. For every round of combat in which you use Psi-surge, you must deduct 2 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points. A weaker form of Psi-surge called Mindblast can be used against an enemy without losing any <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points, but it will add only 2 extra points to your <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ>.

      <p><strong>If you successfully complete the mission as set in Book 11 of the <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> series</strong>, you may add a further Magnakai Discipline of your choice to your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a> in Book 12. This additional skill, together with your other Magnakai skills and any Special Items that you have found and been able to keep during your adventures may then be used in the next adventure in the <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> Magnakai series, which is called <bookref series="lw" book="12tmod"><cite>The Masters of Darkness</cite></bookref>.</p>

      <p><strong>If you have successfully completed any of the previous <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> adventures</strong> you will already possess equipment and Special Items, which you may now use during your adventure in the Daziarn (pass over this section and turn instead to the <a idref="imprvdsc">Improved Disciplines</a> section). However, if this is your first <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> adventure, you will need to equip yourself with weapons and provisions in order to help you survive the perils ahead.</p>

      <p>You are dressed in the grey tunic of an Eruan Pathfinder. You possess a Backpack containing 2 Meals (note these in the <quote>Meals</quote> section of your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>) and a leather pouch containing Gold Crowns. To find out how much gold is in the pouch, pick a number from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a>. Add 10 to the number you have picked. The total equals the number of Gold Crowns inside the pouch, and you should now enter this number in the <quote>Gold Crowns</quote> section of your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>. In addition you may take six items from the list below:</p>
      <ul class="paragraphed">
       <li><p>Sword (Weapons)</p></li>
       <li><p>Bow (Weapons)</p></li>

      <p>There will be occasions during your adventure when you have to fight an enemy. The enemy<ch.apos/>s <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> and <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points are given in the text. Lone Wolf<ch.apos/>s aim in the combat is to kill the enemy by reducing his <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points to zero while losing as few <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points as possible himself.</p>
      <p>At the start of a combat, enter Lone Wolf<ch.apos/>s and the enemy<ch.apos/>s <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points in the appropriate boxes on the Combat Record section of your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
      <p>The sequence for combat is as follows:</p>
      <ol class="paragraphed">
       <li><p>Add any extra points gained through your Magnakai Disciplines and Special Items to your current <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> total.</p></li>
       <li>
        <p>Subtract the <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> of your enemy from this total. The result is your Combat Ratio. Enter it on the <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
        <p>Example</p>
        <p>Lone Wolf (<typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> 15) is attacked by a Nightstalker (<typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> 22). He is not given the opportunity to evade combat but must stand and fight as the creature leaps on him. Lone Wolf has the Magnakai Discipline of Psi-surge to which the Nightstalker is not immune, so Lone Wolf adds 4 points to his <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ>, giving a total <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> of 19.</p>
        <p>He subtracts the Nightstalker<ch.apos/>s <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> from his own, giving a Combat Ratio of <ch.minus/>3. (19 <ch.minus/> 22 = <ch.minus/>3). <ch.minus/>3 is noted on the <a idref="action">Action Chart</a> as the Combat Ratio.</p>
       </li>
       <li><p><a id="stage3">When you have your Combat Ratio</a>, pick a number from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a>.</p></li>
       <li>
        <p>Turn to the <a idref="crtable">Combat Results Table</a>. Along the top of the chart are shown the Combat Ratio numbers. Find the number that is the same as your Combat Ratio and cross-reference it with the random number that you have picked (the random numbers appear on the side of the chart). You now have the number of <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points lost by both Lone Wolf and his enemy in this round of combat. (E represents points lost by the enemy; LW represents points lost by Lone Wolf.)</p>
        <p>Example</p>
        <p>The Combat Ratio between Lone Wolf and the Nightstalker has been established as <ch.minus/>3. If the number taken from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> is a 6, then the result of the first round of combat is:</p>
        <ul>
         <li>Lone Wolf loses 3 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points (plus an additional 2 points for using Psi-surge)</li>
         <li>Nightstalker loses 6 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points</li>
        </ul>
       </li>
       <li><p>On the <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>, mark the changes in <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points to the participants in the combat.</p></li>
       <li><p>Unless otherwise instructed, or unless you have an option to evade, the next round of combat now starts.</p></li>
       <li><p>Repeat the sequence from <a idref="stage3">Stage 3</a>.</p></li>
      </ol>
      <p>This process of combat continues until the <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points of either the enemy or Lone Wolf are reduced to zero or below, at which point the one with the zero score is declared dead. If Lone Wolf is dead, the adventure is over. If the enemy is dead, Lone Wolf proceeds but with his <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points possibly reduced.</p>

All points lost by the enemy as a result of that round are ignored, and you make your escape. Only Lone Wolf may lose <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points during that round, but then that is the risk of running away!

      <p>In the years before their massacre, the Kai Masters of Sommerlund devoted themselves to the study of the Magnakai. These skills were divided into four schools of training called <quote>Lore-circles</quote>. By mastering all of the Magnakai Disciplines of a Lore-circle, the Kai Masters developed their fighting prowess (<typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ>), and their physical and mental stamina (<typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ>) to a level far higher than any mortal warrior could otherwise attain.</p>
      <p>Listed below are the four Lore-circles of the Magnakai and the skills that must be mastered in order to complete them.</p>
      <dl>
      <dt>Circle of Fire</dt>
       <dd>Weaponmastery <ch.ampersand/> Huntmastery</dd>

      <dt>Circle of the Spirit</dt>
       <dd>Psi-surge, Psi-screen, Nexus <ch.ampersand/> Divination</dd>
      </dl>
      <p>By completing a Lore-circle, you may add to your <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> and <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> the extra bonus points that are shown below.</p>

    <p>Your visit to the twilight world of the Daziarn will be fraught with supernatural dangers. As you search for the two remaining Lorestones be on your guard at all times, for here even the laws of nature are strange and unstable. Make notes as you progress through this story for they will be of great help, both in this quest and in the ultimate Magnakai adventure which follows it.</p>
    <p>Many things that you find will help you during your mission. Some Special Items will be of use in this and future <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> books, while others may be red herrings of no real value at all, so be selective in what you decide to keep. If this is your first Magnakai adventure be sure to choose your three Magnakai Disciplines with care, for a wise choice enables any player to complete the quest, no matter how weak their initial <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> and <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points scores. Successful completion of previous <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> adventures, although an advantage, is not essential for the completion of this Magnakai adventure.<a id="kaiwisdm-1" idref="kaiwisdm-1-foot" class="footnote" /></p>
    <p> The future of Magnamund and the restoration of your warrior <ch.eacute/>lite depend on the success of your Daziarn quest. May the spirit of your ancestors and the wisdom of the great God Kai guide your journey along the path of the Magnakai.</p>

      <p>All sense of time and space is lost as you plunge headlong into the whirling black throat of the abyss. Only a numbing chill and a mournful sound, like a million voices crying in despair, accompany you on your descent into the unknown. Gradually your mind is filled with fearful visions, nightmare shapes that reach out of the darkness to claw and bite and scream at your passing. They grow in menace until they are swiftly dispelled by diamond-shaped motes of light, which streak past at incredible speeds. The tiny lights engulf you in a cone of fiery brilliance and a metallic smell of ozone, sharp and pungent, assails your nostrils. A sensation of warmth surges through your frozen limbs. Then, an instant later, you strike solid ground with such a suddenness that you are left stunned and panting for breath.</p>

Now they screech and squeal and rip each other to pieces in their panic to avoid the searing flames. The Fireseed has saved you from their initial attack but you sense that it is just a temporary reprieve. The whole area is saturated with hundreds of their kind and if you stay here you will be overwhelmed by sheer weight of numbers.

You stare across this alien landscape and a feeling of helplessness grips your senses as you realize where you have emerged. This is the twilight world of the Daziarn Plane.</p>
      <p>A knot of fear tightens in your stomach as you recall what little you have heard about this world. The magicians of Sommerlund believe it to be an astral corridor that connects Magnamund with other planes of existence. So, by passing through a Shadow Gate, one of which is situated below the Guildhall in Toran, a person can gain entry to the Daziarn. However, those who have passed through the Shadow Gate in Toran have never been seen again and the magicians believe that the journey can be made in only one direction. They say there is no escape from the Daziarn.</p>
      <p>Your vow to restore the Kai and your stubborn will to survive against all odds refuse to let you believe that there is no way back to your home world. You cast aside your fear and steel yourself for the task of finding a means of escaping from this desolate place. But firstly you must recover the two Lorestones that fell into the Shadow Gate shortly before you.</p>

You strike again and this time he parries your blow and turns it back with such strength that you are sent reeling to the edge of the roof.</p>

      <p>As you look down from the parapet you are greeted by a stirring sight. Lorkon Ironheart<ch.apos/>s army is surging into Tolakos, transforming the chaos-choked grounds into a raging battlefield. At their head you see Lorkon, his silver armour and scarlet cloak tarnished with black blood, striking at the enemy with blurring speed and deadly accuracy. He leads a massive wedge of Meledorian warriors whose faces and armour are painted with magical runes to ward off the creatures of chaos. The Agtah melt before them, like ice before a fire, and flee in panic to the dark safety of the Nahgoth. The Meledorians give a rousing cheer of victory to speed the enemy<ch.apos/>s retreat. But their jubilant cries are soon stifled when, from the depths of the forest, they are answered by a thunderous roar.</p>

      <p>Something huge and deadly is striding towards Tolakos. The ground trembles beneath its step and the air is filled with sounds of great destruction. The crack and groan of sundered trees and the thunderous growls of a gigantic beast grow steadily louder, driving many of Lorkon<ch.apos/>s soldiers to the brink of despair. Desperately he tries to rally them but his voice is lost in the deafening noise.</p>
      <p>Suddenly a gap appears at the forest<ch.apos/>s edge as, effortlessly, a pair of stout trees are pushed apart by monstrous hands. Morbid terror grips the Meledorians and few stand their ground when they see the awesome visage of the Chaos-master looming thirty feet above. You look upon his massive, naked body and feel sickened by what you see. His features are in a constant state of flux, dissolving, merging, and melting into new and ever more hideous shapes. Only Lorkon appears unmoved by the dreadful sight; he raises his sword and challenges the evil being to single combat, but his brave words are met with a howl of derision.</p>

      <p>With terrifying ease the Chaos-master uproots a tree, pares away the branches with the edge of his hand, then wields it like a gigantic club. He strides forward, pursuing Lorkon in a grim game of cat and mouse that leaves a trail of destruction wherever they go. The Meledorian relies on luck and fleetness of foot to avoid the crushing blows, but his luck and skill do not last indefinitely. He slips and falls near the wall of the crypt on the roof of which you are crouching. The Chaos-master bellows with glee and strides forward, his club raised to crush Lorkon to an unrecognizable pulp. His loathsome shoulders draw level with the parapet and, as he steadies himself for the coup de grace, he comes within an arm<ch.apos/>s length of your position.</p>

Angered by his laugh, and your failure, you shoulder your bow and draw a hand weapon as you rush forward, determined to prevent his escape.</p>

      <p>The shining City of Yanis lies before you, rising in circular levels around a turreted citadel of sparkling crystal which dominates the vast, alien metropolis. Constructed out of sheeted platinum, silver, glass and mirrored steel, it reflects the light in a thousand colours from its walls, windows and huge, conical towers, giving it the appearance and splendour of a glowing sun. As the dragonmount glides over the outer walls, you feast your eyes upon a network of broad avenues lined with fragrant, tree-like plants, squares with fountains, and huge, silver, bell-shaped dwellings.</p>

      <p>The vision of your maker shatters with breathtaking suddenness and, without any warning, you fall forwards and plummet into thick, swirling cloud. The scary sensation of this rapid descent leaves you gasping, but the initial shock is soon replaced by the calm certainty that your fall is being controlled by unseen hands. Then, as if awaking from a dream, you become aware that the cloud has faded and the welcome feel of firm ground has returned beneath your feet.</p>

Perched at the top of the cliff is a walled city, whose grim outline and dragon gate you recognize immediately: it is Haagadar, the forgotten city of the Sandai. You stare up at the stronghold, pondering the near-impossible climb to its gate, and try to suppress your mounting fears. Nearby you see a stinking stream of foul water. You follow it to its source and discover that it pours from a grille set into the cliff wall. It must be a sewage channel that services the city above.</p>

      <p>Cautiously you pass through the opening and follow Serocca into a tall, domed chamber that is supported by a circle of huge, rose-veined marble pillars. At its centre stands a large table and, from the ceiling directly above, a flood of light pours down, reflecting and refracting upon its crystal mosaic surface and bathing the chamber walls in spectral colours. She bids you take a seat at the table and, as she lowers herself elegantly into a seat opposite, you cannot but admire her beauty. Her face has the feline characteristics of a young lioness, yet her eyes and her youthful body are distinctly human, save for the soft, velvety nap which covers her flesh. She bears an aura that is powerful and confident, and yet at the same time she seems vulnerable and sad.</p>

      <p><quote>You cannot refuse,</quote> she says, softly. <quote>For everything you do is bound up with your destiny. Your vow to complete the Magnakai quest and restore the Kai, will you give that up? Will you forsake your country and its future security? Will you abandon Magnamund to the evil of the Darklords? No, by your very nature<ch.emdash/>because of your honour and your courage<ch.emdash/>you will act out your part.</quote></p>

      <p><quote>You must do what you have always done.

The light dims and patterns take shape among the tiny squares of crystal. <quote>Observe and learn,</quote> she says. <quote>For the images will impart knowledge that will aid your quest for the Lorestones of your ancestors.</quote></p>

The dimly lit street ends at a central square, where you witness two encouraging sights. Roped to a stone monolith at the centre of the square is a huge, black bird<ch.emdash/>the scarlet warrior<ch.apos/>s winged steed. Behind it, rising in flat-topped tiers is the Temple of the Sandai. Two armour-clad creatures stand guard at the entrance, their rusty helmets crudely adapted to hold their face pads in position. You sense that the Lorestone is here, within the temple, and you scan every inch of it in the hope of finding an unguarded entrance. There are no other doors, but a circular, chimney-like vent protrudes from the middle of the highest tier.</p>

      <p>A sudden sound makes you spin on your heel and instinctively you crouch down ready for combat. A small group of people, dressed in costumes that look vaguely familiar, are marching along the corridor towards the balcony. To avoid them, you hurry down a narrow stair that leads to the hall below and take cover behind the overladen table. From your hiding place you observe the group make their entrance. There are six of them: four men, one woman, and one other who walks with a stoop at the centre of the group and whom you cannot see clearly. You concentrate on their clothing, for there is something about its cut and style that is definitely familiar, yet you cannot pinpoint what it is. Then suddenly you recognize it, and the shock makes you draw breath: they are wearing Sommlending costumes. The five visible faces are now all too familiar to you: Luvias Kort, the Poisoner of Tyso; Falco, highwayman and cut-throat; Aieta Nematah, the Wytch of the Kirlundin Isles; Porgron, murderer; and Gardor Vezh, Chief Druid of Malis Mound, necromancer and cannibal. These are five of Sommerlund<ch.apos/>s most notorious criminals, all of whom were sentenced to be thrown into the Shadow Gate of Toran for their crimes.</p>
      <p>Five pairs of startled eyes glare at the table, alerted by your gasp, and the slick sound of blades leaving oiled scabbards soon follows. The four men and the woman, Aieta, raise their swords and step forward to challenge you. As they move apart you see the sixth member of their group clearly and an icy chill runs down your spine. Slowly you shake your head in disbelief as your stare is returned by the cold, malicious eyes of Vonotar the Traitor.</p>

      <p>Silhouetted against the blazing horizon are six black shapes. They resemble dragons with snaky necks and ragged, bat-like wings, and upon their backs they carry golden-skinned creatures, vaguely human in appearance save for their lack of hair and their massive size. From their flight formation you can tell that they are hunting something on the ground, but it is not until you climb to the top of the cairn that you are able to see their prey. A brace of huge, lizard-like creatures are thundering across the plateau, darting this way and that to avoid the shadows cast by their winged pursuers. They reach the top of a rock-strewn ridge and one of the crimson reptilians comes pounding across the sand towards the cairn. The leading flyer sees you. He banks his dragon mount towards the cairn and the others follow closely in his wake. You fear that they are about to attack but at the last moment they veer away and circle the cairn before landing nearby.</p>

      <p>The warrior shrieks his death-cry and falls backwards, his arms outstretched and his fingers clawing blindly at the air. By chance they become tangled in the rope ladder and his body is lifted into the air as the giant black bird takes to the sky. A wave of panic engulfs you. In desperation you leap up and aim a blow at the small sack in an attempt to cut it loose. Your blow slices open the velvet and one of the two Lorestones tumbles into the graveyard below, coming to rest close to the door of the Sepulchre. Angry and crestfallen, you watch as the bird and its precious cargo rise above the trees and listen helplessly as the muffled flap of its wings fades into the distance.</p>

In three of the four quarters there are etched symbols, but the fourth quarter, which is formed of a soft, clay-like substance, remains blank.

By inscribing the correct symbols in the soft surface of the blank square, you will cause the portal to open. Study the sequence carefully:</p>

The creature gives a gurgling scream and scrambles through the hole, driven by pain and its blind lust for revenge.</p>

Its brilliant light illuminates some strange equipment standing against the walls and cluttering the tables, but little of its heat radiates into the room. You pass on until you come to another gallery which is floored with shining steel like a gigantic mirror. The domed roof is lost in the dim shadows, but at its centre you notice a tiny, disc-shaped portal.

      <p>After snatching a few hours<ch.apos/> sleep you bid Lorkon and his warriors farewell and set off into the Nahgoth Forest. Guided by the map given to you by Serocca, you follow an old timberland path that has never before felt the tread of a man. This track leads to a place where the trees are twisted and gnarled into every conceivable shape. Some look like bent old men; others have straight trunks and curly branches; yet others are coal-black and petrified like fossils.</p>

      <p>There is a moment of cold fear when you first set eyes on the burial grounds of Tolakos. An eerie blue glow, cast by clumps of bacterial fungi, illuminates a mist that seeps from the tombs and crypts of this ancient necropolis. The swirling vapour is contained by a wall which encircles the graveyard, although it is broken in many places where trees have displaced the mouldering stonework. With a weapon at the ready you follow Odel towards one such gap in the wall, which is overshadowed by a great mausoleum.</p>
      <p><quote>This is the Vault of Sedron,</quote> whispers Odel, as he clambers over the rubble and crouches beside its damp grey wall. <quote>Old King Kalon sleeps here.</quote> He removes a throwing knife from his boot and with its tip he points to the other funereal landmarks of Tolakos and identifies them one by one. <quote>That<ch.apos/>s the Crypt of Juilor. Over there are the Graves of the Faithful, and there<ch.apos/>s Baylon<ch.apos/>s Tomb. The Chaos-master and his minions have kept us away from here for nearly a generation, but Lorkon is determined to wrest it from him and restore it to its past glory. Over there, near the centre, is the Grand Sepulchre. That<ch.apos/>s where the bloodline of the Ironheart clan are laid to rest.</quote></p>
      <p>You stare at this macabre building and a powerful feeling electrifies your body. The Sepulchre is an imposing sight, yet it is not the grim splendour of its design that exhilarates you. You are ablaze with the realization that somewhere here, in the Grand Sepulchre of the Ironhearts, lie the last two Lorestones of Nyxator: the objects of your quest.</p>

      <p>A walled city of low, pyramid-shaped dwellings lies spread along the centre of a narrow, wooded valley. Near the middle, rising high above the other buildings, stands a citadel, its colour identical to the drab grey of the sky. Admiringly you observe the intricate carvings which adorn its surface, but your enthusiasm is soon dampened when you see that the streets are teeming with the creatures you encountered at the monolith. You turn to leave but a strange compulsion draws your eyes back to the citadel: it is your Kai sixth sense and it is telling you that Serocca, the one who can aid you in your search for the Lorestones, resides here in this tower of stone.</p>
      <p>The path leads down to an open gate in the city wall where two of its ape-like inhabitants stand guard.</p>

At one end stands a massive table cluttered with artefacts, scrolls, and many strange potions and powders that hint at the practice of alchemy. At the opposite end of the hall is a towering arch, its surface sculptured with all manner of creatures, many of which stir a deep loathing within you. Beneath the arch is a complete darkness: no light at all penetrates or reflects in this inky abyss, for this is the Shadow Gate of Sandai, the doorway back to your home world.</p>

His head is crowned by an elaborate helmet, its visor formed in the shape of a roaring dragon with jewelled eyes and fiery breath. The tangled branches prevent the bird from landing, but a rope ladder hangs from its saddle and the warrior uses it to climb down on to the roof. He leaps the last few feet and his landing disturbs the dense mist that carpets the surface, rolling it back to reveal two glowing golden spheres of crystal, each filled with fire, lying close to where he now stands. He crouches down and your stomach churns with dread as you see him reach out to grab the golden Lorestones.</p>

Twice you lapse into sleep, for how long you cannot guess, yet each time you wake the arrow-shaped flight formation of the dragonmounts remains unchanged and the Yoacor themselves show not the slightest sign of fatigue.</p>
      <p>At length the featureless wastes give way to thick, violet-coloured grasslands dotted with scab-like patches of marsh and bog. The air becomes humid and the faint smell of rotting vegetation conjures up memories of time spent in the Danarg. Gradually the lowlands rise and you soar above high valleys and rock-strewn meadows, broken hills and weather-worn crags. As you approach a narrow cleft between two mountainous peaks the leader raises his hand. Upon this signal the others close into single file. An immense crater lies beyond the pass and at its heart stands a city, the most beautiful city you have ever seen.</p>

      <p>Seated before you at a desk lit by tall candles, one set at each corner, are two pale-skinned Meledorian nobles. The flickering yellow flame glints on the fine antique workmanship of their armour and exaggerates the shadows that play on their faces as they argue their strategies for an impending battle.</p>
      <p>On seeing you enter, the conference is brought to an abrupt close. One of the officers bows and takes his leave; the other beckons a scout to approach the desk and make his report. Briefly the scout tells of how they met you and what has become of your Ookor escort. He shows the officer the Obsidian Seal given to you by Serocca before leaving the city of Thas. The officer clasps the pyramidal stone in the palm of his hand then stares directly into your eyes. A tingle of surprise prickles your skin when you return his gaze, for you notice that his eyes are misty blue, without whites or any obvious pupil.</p>

      <p>Serocca raises her eyes from the table and smiles. <quote>Power is the key, and the power is now within your grasp. The two Lorestones of Nyxator are the power<ch.emdash/>they are the key to your escape from the Daziarn. You must retrieve them from Tolakos, in the Nahgoth Forest, then go to Haagadar. The Shadow Gate is to be found in the Temple of the Sandai at the centre of the city. I can help you reach Tolakos but beyond the Nahgoth my powers of vision grow dim. You must let your skills and this map be your guide there.</quote></p>

You kneel to close his sightless eyes and immediately sense that the Lorestone is close at hand. Guided by instinct you race towards the Lorestone but, as you are running past the entrance to a crypt, you are set upon by a pair of snarling Chaos-creatures.</p>

      <p>The vision of the Nahgoth Forest dissolves and a new one takes its place. It is of a city, perched atop a rocky cliff, surrounded by a wall fortified with towers and grim bastions. Red flames glare from a row of tiny windows and its huge stone gate is emblazoned with the symbol of a fiery dragon.</p>

      <p><quote>This is Haagadar,</quote> says Serocca, cheerlessly. <quote>Once it was the home of the Sandai, the rulers of the Great Plains that stretched to the very edge of the strongholds of Earth. They were the first to fall to chaos and now their plains are dead and empty wastelands of sterile rock and poisoned sand. Haagadar was claimed by the Chaos-master and it became his abode but, as his foul empire expanded, he grew tired of it and abandoned it for other, less remote, cities. It lay deserted for an age before outlaws and refugees from Guakor sought sanctuary there from the creatures of chaos. It is now a forgotten city, yet within its heart there lies a secret that even the Chaos-master failed to discover: the Sandai were the guardians of a Shadow Gate. Long had they kept hidden this portal whilst they searched for a means to enter it, for unlike the Shadow Gates of your world, those of the Daziarn are closed. Only those who possess a key can pass from this realm into the universe of Aon.</quote></p>

      <p>Your shaft penetrates his chainmail at an angle, ripping through his padded underjacket and cutting across his chest. The force of the arrow stuns him momentarily and he cries out in pain. But the pain does not prevent him from scooping the Lorestones into a small velvet sack tied to his sword belt. Quickly you shoulder your bow in favour of a hand weapon as you rush forward to prevent his escape.</p>

      <p>The storm died down while you slept and the plateau is now becalmed. From the rim of the gully you can see six black shapes silhouetted on the blazing horizon. They resemble dragons with snaky necks and ragged bat-like wings. Upon their backs they carry gold-skinned creatures, human in appearance save for their lack of hair and their massive size.</p>
      <p>The leader sees you: he banks his dragonmount towards the gully and the others follow closely in his wake. You fear they are about to attack, but at the last moment they veer away and circle the gully before landing nearby. With practised ease the leader and two of his brothers dismount from their winged steeds. They each dwarf you by an arm<ch.apos/>s length, and, although their heavy muscular bodies seem incapable of stealth, they approach like lions stalking their prey. <foreign><quote>Zeeu klo-ka n<ch.apos/>ra?</quote></foreign> speaks the leader, his voice deep and resonant. <foreign><quote>Ryl<ch.apos/>aan noorna?</quote></foreign> says another, impatiently.</p>

Fatigue dulls your senses and you cannot recall the exact moment you entered the Neverness; like a dream, it is as if you have always been here. Clouds swirl beneath your feet yet they support your weight. You float in a sea and sky of grey light without horizon or boundary, a limitless eternity of space. There are distant sounds, like muffled voices, but when you strive to understand them they fade and you cannot catch the words.</p>
      <p>Time passes, yet time is meaningless, for you cannot tell the order in which events are taking place. From out of the swirling wisps of cloud three globes of darkness arise. They swim closer, hovering to and fro, evolving into the forms of black-hooded riders on demon steeds. Leering skulls peer from the shadow of their cloaks and you see your own eyes reflected in their bony sockets.</p>

      <p>The swirling light draws into focus upon the mirrored floor and you find yourself surrounded by a spectacular cosmic image. At the centre spins a shadow, as dark as deep space, populated with suns and stars and the myriad planets that revolve about them. This microscopic universe is in turn surrounded by a ring of total darkness, and beyond that radiate four beams of differing colour, like the spokes of a gigantic wheel. Between these beams are many areas of light and shade, some running parallel and some in isolation, but all of them connected by a pale, shimmering mist. <quote>What you see before you is a tableau of our worlds, a light-painting that depicts the universe of Aon and the Daziarn Plane,</quote> says the Beholder, as his servant carries him to the dark centre of the floor. <quote>Here, among the suns and stars of Aon, is the planet you know as Magnamund, and beyond it lies the Shadow Gate through which you fell into the Daziarn.</quote> Slowly the Yoacor moves towards you, bearing his master with care as he continues his monologue proudly. <quote>And here, balanced between the elemental strongholds of Fire and Water, lies the Abaxial of Czenos.

He loved me and wished for the union of our realms, but, alas, his love was unrequited; the joining of Guakor and Vhozada was not to be. To win my love and restore his injured pride, Sinay struck a bargain with the Chaos-master, for in keeping with the paradoxical nature of that god, he is obliged to indulge in the granting of wishes to those who would dare demand them of him. The Chaos-master wove a spell to enchant me and Sinay was granted his wish: I became enamoured of him. But the bargains of the Chaos-master are in keeping with his nature<ch.emdash/>they are cruel and fickle. Upon the hour of our wedding he appeared and demanded that Sinay pay for his wish by ceding him half his realm. He was refused, and in retribution he imprisoned me here in this tower and wrought upon Sinay such physical mutation that he fled Guakor and hid himself in shame.</quote></p>

At length the narrow fissure widens and, as your eyes become accustomed to the gloom, you are able to detect that a small cavern lies ahead. Just at this moment a rumbling cacophony surges along the fissure and the floor shudders and heaves beneath your feet. Then a great blast of dust and debris knocks you off balance as it is sucked out of the cavern by the whirlwind now raging directly above. The turmoil soon subsides but, as you drag yourself to your feet, you notice that you are not alone.</p>

He has a youthful face, with high cheek-bones, narrow jaw and a thin, chiselled, aristocratic nose.

But it is his eyes that fascinate you most, for they are filled with knowledge and ancient wisdom.</p>

      <p>Together with six attendant guards, the leader escorts you from the watchtower, across an open courtyard paved with polished steel, and into the entrance hall of the crystal citadel.

A bell is rung and while you catch your breath and wait for the massive door to open you speculate on who the Beholder could be.

      <p>You draw back your golden blade and take aim at the Chaos-master<ch.apos/>s heart. But the closeness of your goodly blade screams a warning at this evil god and quickly he turns to face you. You strike a blow which wounds his side but misses its vital target. With a roar of pain the Chaos-master drops his club and clasps his side.

      <p>Serocca blinks away her tears and forces herself to concentrate on the matter in hand. Again the image fades from the table and a new one takes its place: a picture of forested hills and steep-sided valleys. <quote>This is where the Lorestones emerged from the Shadow Gate,</quote> she says, her voice now calm and controlled. <quote>I detected their presence immediately, for the power they radiate is extraordinary.</quote></p>
      <p><quote>Where is this place?</quote> you ask.</p>
      <p><quote>It is the Nahgoth Forest, close to the border with Meledor. I estimate that the Lorestones lie within a few hundred yards of Tolakos, the ancient burial ground of the Meledorians,</quote> she replies, but with caution in her voice.</p>
      <p><quote>Is this not good news?</quote> you ask, relieved to know at last where the objects of your quest are situated.</p>
      <p><quote>Yes, it is, but for the struggle now taking place in the region. The Meledorians are locked in battle against the forces of the Chaos-master, who is determined to claim all of the Nahgoth for himself. Tolakos is but a few leagues from where the fighting is fiercest.</quote></p>

      <p>You grab the jewelled hilt and are about to hurl it away when you notice that its curvy blade is engraved with a spectacular fiery dragon. At once you recognize the design and your hopes of retrieving the last Lorestone are suddenly revived. It is identical to the symbol you first saw in the Table of Visions: the mark that emblazoned the stone gate of Haagadar.</p>
      <p>You focus your Kai skills on the blade and they confirm your suspicions. The scarlet warrior came from Haagadar, and it is to that distant city that his black-winged mount is now returning with the last Lorestone of the Kai.</p>

      <p>Vonotar lies dead on the black marble floor, his torn body oozing a blood that is thin and vile, like poisonous venom. You roll his corpse aside and take up the Lorestone in your trembling hands. Instantly an overwhelming wave of power is transfused into your being and you feel lifted, in mind and body, to a level of consciousness that transcends your mortal frame. You surrender to its power and under its guidance you are drawn inexorably towards the arch of the Shadow Gate. Willingly you step into the darkness and begin your triumphant return to the world where you were born.</p>

    <p>(<a idref="equipmnt">Equipment</a>) You have no opportunity to use safekeeping at the Monastery or Dessi at the beginning of this adventure. It is therefore inappropriate for you to store surplus items in safekeeping or likewise to retrieve any. Items that may already be stored there will be safe, but you may not add any more at the beginning of this adventure.</p>
    <p>(<a idref="equipmnt">Equipment</a>) You have no opportunity to use safekeeping at the Monastery or Dessi at the beginning of this adventure. It is therefore inappropriate for you to store surplus items in safekeeping or likewise to retrieve any. Items that may already be stored there will be safe, but you may not add any more at the beginning of this adventure.</p>
    <p>(<a idref="kaiwisdm">Magnakai Wisdom</a>) Due to several unavoidable, difficult combats in this book, it is practically impossible for a new or average character to complete this adventure successfully. Even a character with optimal choices of equipment and Disciplines and the highest possible scores for <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> and <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> will have a difficult time with this adventure.</p>
    <p>(<a idref="sect5">5</a>) You do not need to erase a Meal from your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a> when sharing with Arke.</p>
    <p>(<a idref="sect34">34</a>) Unless you possess the Magnakai Discipline of Curing and have reached the Kai rank of Mentora or higher, add 2 to any <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> point losses you sustain during this combat, owing to the poisonous lash of their tentacles. (cf. <a idref="sect298">Section 298</a>)</p>
    <p>(<a idref="sect62">62</a>) If you possess both Disciplines, add only 4 to your number from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a>.</p>
    <p>(<a idref="sect95">95</a>) If you possess both Disciplines, add only 4 to your number from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a>.</p>
    <p>(<a idref="sect198">198</a>) Delete your Backpack as well as its contents. You may not acquire any Backpack Items until your Backpack has been replaced.</p>
    <p>(<a idref="sect201">201</a>) Depending on your interpretation of the rules, you may not be able to benefit from the use of a Shield during this combat.</p>
    <p>(<a idref="sect210">210</a>) If you already possess the maximum number of Special Items, you must discard one in favour of the Obsidian Seal.</p>
    <p>(<a idref="sect261">261</a>) Restore 4 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points to reflect the effects of the draught you have just drunk.</p>
    <p>(<a idref="sect270">270</a>) The <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> bonus for using a Shield does not apply here, nor do those for using Alether or weapon-like Special Items such as the Sommerswerd. Depending on your interpretation of the rules, the bonus granted by the Silver Helm may still be applicable, as it appears to be magical in nature. Also, any bonuses to <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> due to armour should not be applied during this combat.</p>
    <p>(<a idref="sect298">298</a>) You may not evade combat if you have already visited Baylon<ch.apos/>s Tomb. If so, you must stay and fight.</p>
    <p>(<a idref="sect349">349</a>) These bonuses are not cumulative<ch.emdash/>if you possess both Disciplines, you may only add 4 to the number you pick from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a>.</p>
