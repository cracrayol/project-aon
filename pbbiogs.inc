   <p>Paul Bonner is the illustrator of the World of Lone Wolf series of gamebooks. His childhood love of <quote>folk-tales, fairy-stories, <cite>The Hobbit</cite>, Scandanavian tales, myths, and sagas</quote> led Paul Bonner to spend four years at Harrow, a London art school, on an illustrating course. His artwork for the <cite>World of Lone Wolf</cite> series is among his earliest professional work. He subsequently started freelancing for Games Workshop and later accepted a full-time position. He stayed for a few years before moving on to produce full-colour artwork which Games Workshop had not required from him. He moved to Copenhagen, Denmark and again began to work as a freelance illustrator. He currently maintains a <a href="&link.paul.bonner.website;">website</a> with examples of his artwork.</p>
