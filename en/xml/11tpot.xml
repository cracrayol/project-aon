    <p>You are the warrior, Lone Wolf, last of the Kai masters of Sommerlund and sole survivor of the massacre that destroyed your kinsmen during a bitter war with your age-old enemies<ch.emdash/>the Darklords of Helgedad.</p>
    <p> Many centuries have passed since Sun Eagle, the first of your kind, established the Order of the Kai. Aided by the magicians of Dessi, he completed a perilous quest to find seven crystals of power known as the Lorestones of Nyxator, and upon their discovery he unlocked a wisdom and strength that lay within both the Lorestones and himself. He recorded the nature of his discoveries and his experiences in a great tome entitled The Book of the Magnakai. You have discovered this lost Kai treasure and have given a solemn pledge to restore the Kai to their former glory, thereby ensuring the security of your land in the years to come. However, your diligent study of this ancient book has enabled you to master only three of the ten Magnakai Disciplines. To fulfil your pledge, you must complete the quest first undertaken by Sun Eagle over a thousand years ago. By doing so successfully, you, too, will acquire the power and wisdom of the Magnakai, which is held within the Lorestones<ch.apos/> crystal forms.</p>
    <p>Already your quest has taken you far from your northern homeland. Following in the footsteps of the first Kai Grand Master, you journeyed to Dessi and sought the help of the Elder Magi, the magicians who aided Sun Eagle on his quest long ago. There you learned that for centuries the Elder Magi had awaited your coming. An ancient Dessi legend tells of the birth and rise to greatness of two <foreign xml:lang="x-dessi">koura-tas-kai</foreign>, which means <quote>sons of the sun</quote>. One was named <foreign xml:lang="x-dessi">Ikar</foreign>, which means <quote>eagle</quote>, and the other was named <foreign xml:lang="x-dessi">Skarn</foreign>, which means <quote>wolf</quote>. A prophecy foretold that the <foreign xml:lang="x-dessi">koura-tas-kai</foreign> would each come from the north to seek the counsel of the Elder Magi in order that they might fulfil a great quest. Although separated by several centuries, they would share one spirit, one purpose, and one destiny<ch.emdash/>to triumph over the champions of darkness in an age of great peril. The Elder Magi knew that you were <foreign xml:lang="x-dessi">Skarn</foreign><ch.emdash/>the wolf of Dessi legend<ch.emdash/>and in keeping with their ancient vows they promised to help you complete the Magnakai quest.</p>
    <p>In Elzian, the capital of Dessi, you were tutored in the histories of Magnamund and received lessons in lore that you would have learned from the Kai masters if only they, like you, had survived the murderous Darklord attack on the Kai Monastery twelve years ago. You were eager to learn all that your tutor, Lord Rimoah, could teach you in preparation for the next stage of your quest, but grim news from the Darklands cut short your tuition. In the Darklord city of Helgedad a civil war had erupted, following your defeat of Haakon, Archlord of the Black City. After five years, the battle for the throne of Helgedad had finally been won by a Darklord called Gnaag. The other Darklords, now united behind this new leader, were ordered to amass huge armies in preparation for the conquest of Magnamund. Swiftly their Giak legions grew in number, enabling Gnaag to launch a sweeping invasion that was to catch the freelands unprepared. Many countries were completely overrun by Darkland armies; others surrendered without fighting, and sadly there were those who chose to betray former friends and allies by joining the Darklord cause, in the misguided hope that they would share in the spoils of victory, following the triumph of Darklord Gnaag. One such land was Vassagonia, a powerful desert realm to the north of Dessi. It mobilized its formidable army and marched west to join Gnaag<ch.apos/>s horde as it steamrollered across central Magnamund. They were destined to meet at the city of Tahou where, beneath the ancient streets, lay hidden one of the seven Lorestones of Nyxator. You set off in haste for Tahou and arrived barely hours ahead of the enemy. Successfully you made your descent and discovered the object of your quest, but on returning to the surface you found Tahou transformed into a blazing inferno. Darklord Gnaag and Zakhan Kimah, the cruel ruler of Vassagonia, had learnt of your presence and were determined to destroy you at all costs. For days their engines of war had hurled fire and rock across the walls of Tahou with devastating effect. Then a massive assault, led by the Zakhan himself, breached the city gate and gained entry to the burning capital. Armed with a weapon of awesome power, the evil Zakhan sought you out and challenged you to a fight to the death. The struggle was desperate but you emerged victorious and led the Anarians in a counterattack that cleared the city of the invading foe. The allies of Anari arrived to raise the siege and in the ensuing battle the demoralized armies of Gnaag and Kimah were smashed and routed.</p>
    <p> Your defeat of Zakhan Kimah turned the tide of war decisively against the Darkland armies and paved the way for the liberation of the lands they had taken by force. But the sweet taste of victory turned sour when you discovered that Darklord Gnaag had captured the last three remaining Lorestones of Nyxator, and had vowed to avenge his defeat by destroying them and killing you. Alarmed by this, the High Council of the Elder Magi joined you in Tahou to help formulate a plan of action. They had already received word from Prince Graygor, the ruler of Eru, that three radiant gems filled with golden light had been transported to the fortress of Torgar from the Darklord city of Mozg<ch.ocirc/>ar. Unable to tolerate the goodly power of the Lorestones within his own domain, Gnaag had been forced to move them to Torgar where his sorcerers<ch.emdash/>the Nadziranim<ch.emdash/>set about searching for a means to destroy them. Fearing that they might achieve their task, the Elder Magi made preparations for your secret journey to Eru and, in order to safeguard your true identity, you adopted the guise of a Pathfinder<ch.emdash/>one of Prince Graygor<ch.apos/>s <ch.eacute/>lite woodland scouts.</p>
    <p>After a long and perilous journey you arrived at Torgar to find it besieged by the armies of Talestria and Palmyrion. During the early months of the Darklord invasion, hundreds of Talestrians were enslaved and sent to labour in the dungeons and sulphur mines deep within the bowels of this grim city-fortress. Their plight seemed hopeless until the allied armies, under the command of Lord Adamas of Garthen, finally arrived to liberate them. Due in part to your bravery and skill during the assault, Lord Adamas<ch.apos/> troops were able to breach the great Torgar gate and storm its citadel. During this fierce battle you gained entry to the chamber at the heart of the citadel where the Nadziranim were attempting to destroy the Lorestones. They were hung above a circular black pit and suspended in a fireball of negative energy, the focal point of several beams of power emanating from crystals set around the edge of the pit. By means of a gantry you were able to climb above these energy beams and retrieve one of the Lorestones. But, as you reached out for the remaining two, a terrible voice filled the chamber.</p>
    <p><quote>Vengeance is mine, Lone Wolf!</quote> Terror struck deep in your heart as you turned and saw the ghastly form of Darklord Gnaag. A rasping laugh echoed from his fly-like head as he raised a black crystal and pointed it at the gantry. <quote>The vow I gave at Tahou shall be fulfilled. Now I shall destroy you and the Lorestones!</quote> he gloated.</p>
    <p>There was a deafening crack and a bolt of blue lightning leapt from the stone towards the rusty iron gantry. As the shock wave hit the fireball the two remaining Lorestones were sent tumbling into the black abyss. A second bolt ripped the gantry in two and, with the ghastly laugh of Darklord Gnaag ringing in your ears, you fell headlong into a portal of total darkness, a Shadow Gate which leads to the twilight world of the Daziarn Plane.</p>

   <data>
    <p>You keep a record of your adventure on the <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
    <p>During your training as a Kai Master you have developed fighting prowess<ch.emdash/><typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> and physical stamina<ch.emdash/><typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ>. Before you set off on your adventure you need to measure how effective your training has been. To do this take a pencil and, with your eyes closed, point with the blunt end of it onto the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a>. If you pick 0 it counts as zero.</p>
    <p>The first number that you pick from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> in this way represents your <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ>. Add 10 to the number you picked and write the total in the <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> section of your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a> (i.e. if your pencil fell on the number 4 in the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> you would write in a <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> of 14). When you fight, your <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> will be pitted against that of your enemy. A high score in this section is therefore very desirable.</p>
    <p>The second number that you pick from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> represents your powers of <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ>. Add 20 to this number and write the total in the <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> section of your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a> (i.e. if your pencil fell on the number 6 on the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> you would have 26 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points).</p>
    <p>If you are wounded in combat you will lose <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points. If at any time your <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points fall to zero or below, you are dead and the adventure is over. Lost <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points can be regained during the course of the adventure, but your number of <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points can never rise above the number you started with.</p>
    <p><strong>If you have successfully completed any of the previous adventures in the <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> series</strong>, you can carry your current scores of <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> and <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points over to Book 11. You may also carry over any Weapons and Special Items you have in your possession at the end of your last adventure, and these should be entered on your new <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>. (You are still limited to two Weapons and eight Backpack Items.)</p>
    <p>You many choose one bonus <a idref="discplnz">Magnakai Discipline</a> to add to your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a> for every <cite>Lone Wolf Magnakai</cite> adventure you successfully complete (Books 6<ch.endash/>12).</p>

      <p>During your training as a Kai Lord, and in the course of the adventures that led to the discovery of <cite>The Book of the Magnakai</cite>, you have mastered all ten of the basic warrior skills known as the Kai Disciplines.</p>
      <p>After studying <cite>The Book of the Magnakai</cite>, you have also reached the rank of Kai Master Superior, which means that you have learnt <em>three</em> of the Magnakai Disciplines listed below. It is up to you to choose which three skills these are. As all of the Magnakai Disciplines may be of use to you at some point on your adventure, pick your three with care. The correct use of a Magnakai Discipline at the right time can save your life.</p>
      <p>The Magnakai skills are divided into groups, each of which is governed by a separate school of training. These groups are called <quote>Lore-circles</quote>. By mastering all of the Magnakai Disciplines in a particular Lore-circle, you can gain an increase in your <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> and <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points score. (See the section <quote><a idref="lorecrcl">Lore-circles of the Magnakai</a></quote> for details of these bonuses.)</p>
      <p>When you have chosen your three Magnakai Disciplines, enter them in the Magnakai Disciplines section of your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>.</p>

        <p>This Magnakai Discipline enables a Kai Master to become proficient in the use of all types of weapon. When you enter combat with a weapon you have mastered, you add 3 points to your <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ>. If you have the Magnakai Discipline of Weaponmastery with Bow, you may add 3 to any number that you choose from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a>, when using the Bow. The rank of Kai Master Superior, with which you begin the Magnakai series, means you are skilled in <em>three</em> of the weapons in the list below.</p>

        <p>The fact that you are skilled with three Weapons does not mean that you begin the adventure carrying any of them.

        <p>If you choose this skill, write <quote>Weaponmastery: <ch.plus/>3 <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> points</quote> on your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>, and tick your chosen weapons on the <a idref="action">Weapons List</a>. You cannot carry more than two Weapons.</p>

        <p>It is a powerful Discipline, but it is also a costly one. For every round of combat in which you use Psi-surge, you must deduct 2 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points. A weaker form of Psi-surge called Mindblast can be used against an enemy without losing any <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points, but it will add only 2 extra points to your <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ>. (Psi-surge and Mindblast cannot be used simultaneously.) Psi-surge cannot be used if your <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> falls to 6 points or below, and not all of the creatures encountered on your adventure will be affected by it; you will be told if a creature is immune.</p>

However, if this is your first <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> adventure, you will need to equip yourself with weapons and provisions in order to help you survive the perils ahead.</p>

      <p>You are dressed in the grey tunic of an Eruan Pathfinder. You possess a Backpack containing 2 Meals (note these in the <quote>Meals</quote> section of your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>) and a leather pouch containing Gold Crowns. To find out how much gold is in the pouch, pick a number from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a>. Add 10 to the number you have picked. The total equals the number of Gold Crowns inside the pouch, and you should now enter this number in the <quote>Gold Crowns</quote> section of your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>.

      <p>There will be occasions during your adventure when you have to fight an enemy. The enemy<ch.apos/>s <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> and <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points are given in the text. Lone Wolf<ch.apos/>s aim in the combat is to kill the enemy by reducing his <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points to zero while losing as few <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points as possible himself.</p>
      <p>At the start of a combat, enter Lone Wolf<ch.apos/>s and the enemy<ch.apos/>s <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points in the appropriate boxes on the Combat Record section of your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
      <p>The sequence for combat is as follows:</p>
      <ol class="paragraphed">
       <li><p>Add any extra points gained through your Magnakai Disciplines and Special Items to your current <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> total.</p></li>
       <li>
        <p>Subtract the <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> of your enemy from this total. The result is your Combat Ratio. Enter it on the <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
        <p>Example</p>
        <p>Lone Wolf (<typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> 15) is attacked by a Nightstalker (<typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> 22). He is not given the opportunity to evade combat but must stand and fight as the creature leaps on him. Lone Wolf has the Magnakai Discipline of Psi-surge to which the Nightstalker is not immune, so Lone Wolf adds 4 points to his <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ>, giving a total <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> of 19.</p>
        <p>He subtracts the Nightstalker<ch.apos/>s <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> from his own, giving a Combat Ratio of <ch.minus/>3. (19 <ch.minus/> 22 = <ch.minus/>3). <ch.minus/>3 is noted on the <a idref="action">Action Chart</a> as the Combat Ratio.</p>
       </li>
       <li><p><a id="stage3">When you have your Combat Ratio</a>, pick a number from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a>.</p></li>
       <li>
        <p>Turn to the <a idref="crtable">Combat Results Table</a>. Along the top of the chart are shown the Combat Ratio numbers. Find the number that is the same as your Combat Ratio and cross-reference it with the random number that you have picked (the random numbers appear on the side of the chart). You now have the number of <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points lost by both Lone Wolf and his enemy in this round of combat. (E represents points lost by the enemy; LW represents points lost by Lone Wolf.)</p>
        <p>Example</p>
        <p>The Combat Ratio between Lone Wolf and the Nightstalker has been established as <ch.minus/>3. If the number taken from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> is a 6, then the result of the first round of combat is:</p>
        <ul>
         <li>Lone Wolf loses 3 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points (plus an additional 2 points for using Psi-surge)</li>
         <li>Nightstalker loses 6 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points</li>
        </ul>
       </li>
       <li><p>On the <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>, mark the changes in <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points to the participants in the combat.</p></li>
       <li><p>Unless otherwise instructed, or unless you have an option to evade, the next round of combat now starts.</p></li>
       <li><p>Repeat the sequence from <a idref="stage3">Stage 3</a>.</p></li>
      </ol>
      <p>This process of combat continues until the <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points of either the enemy or Lone Wolf are reduced to zero or below, at which point that combatant is declared dead. If Lone Wolf is dead, the adventure is over. If the enemy is dead, Lone Wolf proceeds but with his <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points possibly reduced.</p>

      <p>In the years before their massacre, the Kai Masters of Sommerlund devoted themselves to the study of the Magnakai. These skills were divided into four schools of training called <quote>Lore-circles</quote>. By mastering all of the Magnakai Disciplines of a Lore-circle, the Kai Masters developed their fighting prowess (<typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ>), and their physical and mental stamina (<typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ>) to a level far higher than any mortal warrior could otherwise attain.</p>
      <p>Listed below are the four Lore-circles of the Magnakai and the skills that must be mastered in order to complete them.</p>
      <dl>
      <dt>Circle of Fire</dt>
       <dd>Weaponmastery <ch.ampersand/> Huntmastery</dd>

      <p>As you rise through the higher levels of Magnakai training you will find that some of your skills will steadily improve. If you have reached the rank of Primate (four skills), Tutelary (five skills), Principalin (six skills), Mentora (seven skills) or Scion-kai (eight skills), you will now benefit from improvements to the following Magnakai Disciplines:</p>

         <dt>Curing</dt>
          <dd>Primates with this skill have the ability to delay the effects of poisons, including venoms, that they may come into contact with.

         <dt>Psi-surge</dt>
          <dd>Primates with the Magnakai Discipline of Psi-surge will, by concentrating their psychic powers upon an object, be able to set up vibrations that may lead to the disruption or destruction of the object.</dd>

          <dd>Scion-kai are able to leave their body in a state of suspended animation and, in spirit form, explore their immediate surroundings unhindered by physical limitations. This ability is called <quote>spirit walking</quote>. The length of time a Kai Master can spirit walk increases as he rises in rank. When the spirit is separated from the body in this fashion, the body remains inanimate and vulnerable to attack. If a Kai Master<ch.apos/>s body is killed whilst he is spirit walking, his spiritual self will also cease to exist, and vice versa.</dd>

     <p>Due to several unavoidable, difficult combats in this book, it is practically impossible for a new or average character to complete this adventure successfully.

    <p>Your visit to the twilight world of the Daziarn will be fraught with supernatural dangers. As you search for the two remaining Lorestones be on your guard at all times, for here even the laws of nature are strange and unstable. Make notes as you progress through this story for they will be of great help, both in this quest and in the ultimate Magnakai adventure which follows it.</p>
    <p>Many things that you find will help you during your mission. Some Special Items will be of use in this and future <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> books, while others may be red herrings of no real value at all, so be selective in what you decide to keep. If this is your first Magnakai adventure be sure to choose your three Magnakai Disciplines with care, for a wise choice enables any player to complete the quest, no matter how weak their initial <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> and <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points scores. Successful completion of previous <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> adventures, although an advantage, is not essential for the completion of this Magnakai adventure.<footref id="kaiwisdm-1" idref="kaiwisdm-1-foot"/></p>
    <p> The future of Magnamund and the restoration of your warrior <ch.eacute/>lite depend on the success of your Daziarn quest. May the spirit of your ancestors and the wisdom of the great God Kai guide your journey along the path of the Magnakai.</p>

      <p>All sense of time and space is lost as you plunge headlong into the whirling black throat of the abyss. Only a numbing chill and a mournful sound, like a million voices crying in despair, accompany you on your descent into the unknown. Gradually your mind is filled with fearful visions, nightmare shapes that reach out of the darkness to claw and bite and scream at your passing. They grow in menace until they are swiftly dispelled by diamond-shaped motes of light, which streak past at incredible speeds. The tiny lights engulf you in a cone of fiery brilliance and a metallic smell of ozone, sharp and pungent, assails your nostrils. A sensation of warmth surges through your frozen limbs. Then, an instant later, you strike solid ground with such a suddenness that you are left stunned and panting for breath.</p>

      <p>You throw the Fireseed against the wall of the tomb and it bursts into flame, showering the Chaos-creatures with splinters of stone and motes of red fire. Now they screech and squeal and rip each other to pieces in their panic to avoid the searing flames. The Fireseed has saved you from their initial attack but you sense that it is just a temporary reprieve. The whole area is saturated with hundreds of their kind and if you stay here you will be overwhelmed by sheer weight of numbers. Reluctantly you are forced back to the Grand Sepulchre and the three tentacled horrors that command its entrance.</p>

Three gleaming bronze chariots, each drawn by a team of strange, horse-like creatures called onipa, are ready and waiting to take you to Tolakos. With the Ookor captain you climb aboard the leading chariot and grab the hand-rail as its driver cracks his whip. The onipa surge forward and, in a cloud of thick dust, the chariots race out of the city and along a stony road that cuts through the centre of the valley beyond.</p>

      <p>Desperately he tries to avoid your Arrow but it penetrates his armour and lodges in the side of his neck. He screams at the sudden pain and tears the offending shaft from his flesh, hurling it back at you contemptuously. Such fortitude is impressive but you can tell that he has suffered a serious wound. Feverishly he scoops the Lorestones into a small velvet sack which hangs from his sword belt, and you shoulder your Bow in favour of a hand weapon as you run forward to prevent his escape.</p>

      <p>With dread anticipation you stagger to your feet to survey your new surroundings. A bleak and desolate plateau, seemingly devoid of life, stretches into the distance on all sides. Jagged boulders litter a desert of crimson sand, which is stirred to restless motion by fierce and scorching winds. Neither sun nor moon hang in the amber skies above, yet their absence does not leave this world in darkness, for all along the horizon blazes a fire which glows brighter than a thousand sunsets. You stare across this alien landscape and a feeling of helplessness grips your senses as you realize where you have emerged. This is the twilight world of the Daziarn Plane.</p>
      <p>A knot of fear tightens in your stomach as you recall what little you have heard about this world. The magicians of Sommerlund believe it to be an astral corridor that connects Magnamund with other planes of existence. So, by passing through a Shadow Gate, one of which is situated below the Guildhall in Toran, a person can gain entry to the Daziarn. However, those who have passed through the Shadow Gate in Toran have never been seen again and the magicians believe that the journey can be made in only one direction. They say there is no escape from the Daziarn.</p>
      <p>Your vow to restore the Kai and your stubborn will to survive against all odds refuse to let you believe that there is no way back to your home world. You cast aside your fear and steel yourself for the task of finding a means of escaping from this desolate place. But firstly you must recover the two Lorestones that fell into the Shadow Gate shortly before you.</p>

Lorkon Ironheart<ch.apos/>s army is surging into Tolakos, transforming the chaos-choked grounds into a raging battlefield. At their head you see Lorkon, his silver armour and scarlet cloak tarnished with black blood, striking at the enemy with blurring speed and deadly accuracy. He leads a massive wedge of Meledorian warriors whose faces and armour are painted with magical runes to ward off the creatures of chaos. The Agtah melt before them, like ice before a fire, and flee in panic to the dark safety of the Nahgoth. The Meledorians give a rousing cheer of victory to speed the enemy<ch.apos/>s retreat. But their jubilant cries are soon stifled when, from the depths of the forest, they are answered by a thunderous roar.</p>

      <p>Something huge and deadly is striding towards Tolakos. The ground trembles beneath its step and the air is filled with sounds of great destruction. The crack and groan of sundered trees and the thunderous growls of a gigantic beast grow steadily louder, driving many of Lorkon<ch.apos/>s soldiers to the brink of despair. Desperately he tries to rally them but his voice is lost in the deafening noise.</p>
      <p>Suddenly a gap appears at the forest<ch.apos/>s edge as, effortlessly, a pair of stout trees are pushed apart by monstrous hands. Morbid terror grips the Meledorians and few stand their ground when they see the awesome visage of the Chaos-master looming thirty feet above. You look upon his massive, naked body and feel sickened by what you see. His features are in a constant state of flux, dissolving, merging, and melting into new and ever more hideous shapes. Only Lorkon appears unmoved by the dreadful sight; he raises his sword and challenges the evil being to single combat, but his brave words are met with a howl of derision.</p>

      <p>With terrifying ease the Chaos-master uproots a tree, pares away the branches with the edge of his hand, and then wields it like a gigantic club. He strides forward, pursuing Lorkon in a grim game of cat and mouse that leaves a trail of destruction wherever they go. The Meledorian relies on luck and fleetness of foot to avoid the crushing blows, but his luck and skill do not last indefinitely. He slips and falls near the wall of the crypt on the roof of which you are crouching. The Chaos-master bellows with glee and strides forward, his club raised to crush Lorkon to an unrecognizable pulp.

A surge of damp air whips past you, sucked into the chamber beyond, as the airtight seal is broken after many decades. Torches ignite spontaneously and, for the first time in its long history, the secrets of the inner sanctum of the Great Sepulchre are revealed to the eyes of an Aonian.</p>

Constructed out of sheeted platinum, silver, glass, and mirrored steel, it reflects the light in a thousand colours from its walls, windows, and huge, conical towers, giving it the appearance and splendour of a glowing sun. As the dragonmount glides over the outer walls, you feast your eyes upon a network of broad avenues lined with fragrant, tree-like plants, squares with fountains, and huge, silver, bell-shaped dwellings.</p>

You stare up at the stronghold, pondering the near-impossible climb to its gate, and try to suppress your mounting fears. Nearby you see a stinking stream of foul water. You follow it to its source and discover that it pours from a grille set into the cliff wall. It must be a sewage channel that services the city above.</p>

      <p>Cautiously you pass through the opening and follow Serocca into a tall, domed chamber that is supported by a circle of huge, rose-veined marble pillars. At its centre stands a large table and, from the ceiling directly above, a flood of light pours down, reflecting and refracting upon its crystal mosaic surface and bathing the chamber walls in spectral colours. She bids you take a seat at the table and, as she lowers herself elegantly into a seat opposite, you cannot but admire her beauty. Her face has the feline characteristics of a young lioness, yet her eyes and her youthful body are distinctly human, save for the soft, velvety nap which covers her flesh. She bears an aura that is powerful and confident, and yet at the same time she seems vulnerable and sad.</p>

      <p>Carefully you prise open the heavy silver lid and stare at the shrunken remains of Lord Baylon. He lies on a mattress of diamonds and gemstones, his yellowed bones encased in ornate burial armour, and by his side rests a massive, two-handed sword. Its blade of solid gold is inscribed with a long list of battle honours and deeds of valour. You sense that this weapon is purely symbolic, a replica of his true sword, for its soft, gold blade would never hold a keen edge or withstand the rigours of battle. You are about to close the lid when you notice something else lying next to the sword: a Silver Flask. You pull its stopper and discover that it contains a wine that smells fresh and wholesome.</p>

      <p>A sudden sound makes you spin on your heel and instinctively you crouch down ready for combat. A small group of people, dressed in costumes that look vaguely familiar, are marching along the corridor towards the balcony. To avoid them, you hurry down a narrow stair that leads to the hall below and take cover behind the overladen table. From your hiding place you observe the group make their entrance. There are six of them: four men, one woman, and one other who walks with a stoop at the centre of the group and whom you cannot see clearly. You concentrate on their clothing, for there is something about its cut and style that is definitely familiar, yet you cannot pinpoint what it is. Then suddenly you recognize it, and the shock makes you draw breath: they are wearing Sommlending costumes. The five visible faces are now all too familiar to you: Luvias Kort, the Poisoner of Tyso; Falco, highwayman and cut-throat; Aieta Nematah, the Wytch of the Kirlundin Isles; Porgron, murderer; and Gardor Vezh, Chief Druid of Malis Mound, necromancer and cannibal. These are five of Sommerlund<ch.apos/>s most notorious criminals, all of whom were sentenced to be thrown into the Shadow Gate of Toran for their crimes.</p>
      <p>Five pairs of startled eyes glare at the table, alerted by your gasp, and the slick sound of blades leaving oiled scabbards soon follows. The four men and the woman, Aieta, raise their swords and step forward to challenge you. As they move apart you see the sixth member of their group clearly and an icy chill runs down your spine. Slowly you shake your head in disbelief as your stare is returned by the cold, malicious eyes of Vonotar the Traitor.</p>

The toe of your left boot is cut through but fortunately your foot has escaped without a scratch. Cautiously you try to locate what caused such a vicious cut and discover the scarlet warrior<ch.apos/>s curvy-bladed sword.</p>

      <p>Cradled in the muscular arms of a Yoacor guard lies the loathsome, stunted form of the Beholder. His withered, corpse-green body is no bigger than a human child<ch.apos/>s, yet his bulbous head is enormous by comparison, far larger even than that of the giant who is holding him. It wobbles and sways repulsively when he turns to focus his eyes on you. Like polished gemstones these two blank orbs glint in the flickering light of the chamber, their cold sharpness revealing the intelligent being that lies imprisoned within the crippled shell.</p>

From their flight formation you can tell that they are hunting something on the ground, but it is not until you climb to the top of the cairn that you are able to see their prey. A brace of huge, lizard-like creatures are thundering across the plateau, darting this way and that to avoid the shadows cast by their winged pursuers. They reach the top of a rock-strewn ridge and one of the crimson reptilians comes pounding across the sand towards the cairn. The leading flyer sees you. He banks his dragon mount towards the cairn and the others follow closely in his wake.

      <p>You follow Odel, leaving the encampment by slipping over the perimeter wall. Soon you merge like shadows into the thick forest beyond. The giant trunks support a canopy of dense foliage that blocks out the light and keeps the forest floor bathed in a perpetual twilight. A carpet of moss muffles your footfalls and the only foliage that grows in abundance is a bushy velvet lichen patterned with orange-headed, tooth-sized growths. <quote>Khetu Spores,</quote> says Odel, noticing your interest in the strange flora. <quote>They<ch.apos/>re deadly poisonous.</quote></p>

      <p>The Beholder deactivates the light-picture and wills his servant to carry him back to the first gallery. There, bathed in the shadowless glow of the fireball, stands a huge globe of silvery metal. At his approach it radiates an eerie phosphorescent light and symbols appear upon its surface.</p>
      <p><quote>The Lorestones entered the Shadow Gate some moments before you fell, is that not so?</quote> asks the Beholder, incisively. You confirm this to be the case and watch with fascination as the symbols shift and change colour. <quote>There are many channels within the Shadow Gate that are warped by the vagaries of time and space. Usually it is an impossible task to predict where an object passing through to the Daziarn will materialize, but the coordinates of your arrival are known and this will help my calculations.</quote></p>
      <p>Slowly the symbols begin to disappear until just three remain. <quote>Without knowing the precise Aon-time they entered the Shadow Gate I can find only an approximate location,</quote> he says, scrutinizing the symbols. <quote>As reckoned by the time-scale of your planet, the Lorestones arrived on the Daziarn forty-one hours ago. They materialized together and intact in the forest of the Khat Trisect of Vhozada<ch.emdash/>a realm situated between the elemental strongholds of Earth and Water. This bodes well for you, human. Vhozada is a temperate and stable domain, rich in those elements necessary to sustain mortal life-forms. Also, there is one of great vision who has made this her home. Her name is Serocca. It would be wise to seek her help in finding these stones of power, for she is sure to know their whereabouts.</quote></p>
      <p>Although his words revive your flagging hopes, you are still fearful that the Lorestones are beyond your recovery. The Beholder senses your apprehension and tries to allay your fears by offering you a means of transportation to the realm of Vhozada. He promises that your passage will be swift, but, when you learn what the journey entails, your blood runs cold.</p>

      <p>The warrior shrieks his death-cry and falls backwards, his arms outstretched and his fingers clawing blindly at the air. By chance they become tangled in the rope ladder and his body is lifted into the air as the giant black bird takes to the sky. A wave of panic engulfs you. In desperation you leap up and aim a blow at the small sack in an attempt to cut it loose. Your blow slices open the velvet and one of the two Lorestones tumbles into the graveyard below, coming to rest close to the door of the Sepulchre. Angry and crestfallen, you watch as the bird and its precious cargo rise above the trees and listen helplessly as the muffled flap of its wings fades into the distance.</p>

You pass on until you come to another gallery which is floored with shining steel like a gigantic mirror.

      <p>There is a moment of cold fear when you first set eyes on the burial grounds of Tolakos. An eerie blue glow, cast by clumps of bacterial fungi, illuminates a mist that seeps from the tombs and crypts of this ancient necropolis. The swirling vapour is contained by a wall which encircles the graveyard, although it is broken in many places where trees have displaced the mouldering stonework. With a weapon at the ready you follow Odel towards one such gap in the wall, which is overshadowed by a great mausoleum.</p>
      <p><quote>This is the Vault of Sedron,</quote> whispers Odel, as he clambers over the rubble and crouches beside its damp grey wall. <quote>Old King Kalon sleeps here.</quote> He removes a throwing knife from his boot and with its tip he points to the other funereal landmarks of Tolakos and identifies them one by one. <quote>That<ch.apos/>s the Crypt of Juilor. Over there are the Graves of the Faithful, and there<ch.apos/>s Baylon<ch.apos/>s Tomb. The Chaos-master and his minions have kept us away from here for nearly a generation, but Lorkon is determined to wrest it from him and restore it to its past glory. Over there, near the centre, is the Grand Sepulchre. That<ch.apos/>s where the bloodline of the Ironheart clan are laid to rest.</quote></p>
      <p>You stare at this macabre building and a powerful feeling electrifies your body. The Sepulchre is an imposing sight, yet it is not the grim splendour of its design that exhilarates you. You are ablaze with the realization that somewhere here, in the Grand Sepulchre of the Ironhearts, lie the last two Lorestones of Nyxator: the objects of your quest.</p>

His head is crowned by an elaborate helmet, its visor formed in the shape of a roaring dragon with jewelled eyes and fiery breath. The tangled branches prevent the bird from landing, but a rope ladder hangs from its saddle and the warrior uses it to climb down onto the roof. He leaps the last few feet and his landing disturbs the dense mist that carpets the surface, rolling it back to reveal two glowing golden spheres of crystal, each filled with fire, lying close to where he now stands. He crouches down and your stomach churns with dread as you see him reach out to grab the golden Lorestones.</p>

      <p>The Plain of Guakor stretches to the cloudy horizon like a vast sea of dust, broken only occasionally by a boulder or clump of wire-hard scrub. It is a drear panorama: a land once rich and fertile murdered by the curse of chaos. It instils in you a feeling of dread uncertainty at first, but as you trudge each weary mile, it slowly strengthens your determination to fulfil your quest. For the fate that has befallen Guakor will befall Sommerlund if you fail to find the last Lorestone and return to defeat Darklord Gnaag.</p>

      <p>With a mighty screech, the dragonmounts take to the air in unison, the beat of their great wings filling your ears with a thunderous drumming noise. Your stomach heaves as the leader tugs at the reins, sending the beast labouring steeply into the fire-orange sky. The ground below falls away at an alarming rate and within minutes you are travelling hundreds of feet above the plateau, your vision blurred by the speed of the rushing wind.</p>
      <p>Beneath you the trackless waste stretches away to the burning horizon. Without sun or moon or any change in the brightness of the sky you find it impossible to gauge the passage of time. Twice you lapse into sleep, for how long you cannot guess, yet each time you wake the arrow-shaped flight formation of the dragonmounts remains unchanged and the Yoacor themselves show not the slightest sign of fatigue.</p>
      <p>At length the featureless wastes give way to thick, violet-coloured grasslands dotted with scab-like patches of marsh and bog. The air becomes humid and the faint smell of rotting vegetation conjures up memories of time spent in the Danarg. Gradually the lowlands rise and you soar above high valleys and rock-strewn meadows, broken hills, and weather-worn crags. As you approach a narrow cleft between two mountainous peaks the leader raises his hand. Upon this signal the others close into single file. An immense crater lies beyond the pass and at its heart stands a city, the most beautiful city you have ever seen.</p>

The officer clasps the pyramidal stone in the palm of his hand then stares directly into your eyes. A tingle of surprise prickles your skin when you return his gaze, for you notice that his eyes are misty blue, without whites or any obvious pupil.</p>

      <p><quote>This is Haagadar,</quote> says Serocca, cheerlessly. <quote>Once it was the home of the Sandai, the rulers of the Great Plains that stretched to the very edge of the strongholds of Earth. They were the first to fall to chaos and now their plains are dead and empty wastelands of sterile rock and poisoned sand. Haagadar was claimed by the Chaos-master and it became his abode but, as his foul empire expanded, he grew tired of it and abandoned it for other, less remote, cities. It lay deserted for an age before outlaws and refugees from Guakor sought sanctuary there from the creatures of chaos. It is now a forgotten city, yet within its heart there lies a secret that even the Chaos-master failed to discover: the Sandai were the guardians of a Shadow Gate. Long had they kept hidden this portal whilst they searched for a means to enter it, for unlike the Shadow Gates of your world, those of the Daziarn are closed. Only those who possess a key can pass from this realm into the universe of Aon.</quote></p>

      <p>Few walk the shadowy avenues of Haagadar; the atmosphere is so thick with the smell of salt and sulphur that those whom you do pass are unrecognizable behind the damp pads they press to their faces to ward off the cloying stench. The dimly lit street ends at a central square where you witness two encouraging sights. Roped to a stone monolith at the centre of the square is a huge, black bird<ch.emdash/>the scarlet warrior<ch.apos/>s winged steed. Behind it, rising in flat-topped tiers, is the Temple of the Sandai. Two armour-clad creatures stand guard at the entrance, their rusty helmets crudely adapted to fix their face pads in position. You sense that the Lorestone is here within the temple, and you scan every inch of it in the hope of finding an unguarded entrance. There are no other doors, but a circular, chimney-like vent protrudes from the middle of the highest tier.</p>

He loved me and wished for the union of our realms, but, alas, his love was unrequited; the joining of Guakor and Vhozada was not to be. To win my love and restore his injured pride, Sinay struck a bargain with the Chaos-master, for in keeping with the paradoxical nature of that god, he is obliged to indulge in the granting of wishes to those who would dare demand them of him. The Chaos-master wove a spell to enchant me and Sinay was granted his wish: I became enamoured of him. But the bargains of the Chaos-master are in keeping with his nature<ch.emdash/>they are cruel and fickle. Upon the hour of our wedding he appeared and demanded that Sinay pay for his wish by ceding him half his realm. He was refused, and in retribution he imprisoned me here in this tower and wrought upon Sinay such physical mutation that he fled Guakor and hid himself in shame.</quote></p>

Unable to resist any longer, you close your eyes and drift off into a restless sleep.</p>
