     <p>You are a Grand Master of the New Order of the Kai<ch.emdash/>the warrior <ch.eacute/>lite of Sommerlund.</p>

     <p>It is autumn of the year MS 5083, thirty-three years after the First Order of the Kai was nearly wiped out by the Darklords of Helgedad. These champions of evil, who were sent by the Dark God Naar to destroy your fertile world of Magnamund, have since been destroyed. Lone Wolf, the leader of your illustrious fighting order, was the only survivor of the massacre. As a young Kai initiate he stood amidst the burning wreckage of the old Kai Monastery and vowed to avenge the slaughter of his comrades. In the year MS 5070 he kept his pledge when alone he infiltrated the foul domain of the Darklords and destroyed the infernal city of Helgedad, the base of their evil power.</p>

     <p>With the fall of Helgedad, chaos befell the Darkland armies who had, until then, been poised to conquer all Magnamund. Quickly their disorder escalated into a mutinous civil war which allowed the Freeland Alliance armies of Magnamund time enough to recover and launch a successful counter-offensive. Against all odds, a swift and total victory was secured over the feuding armies of evil.</p>

     <p>Following the demise of the Darklords, peace has reigned in your homeland of Sommerlund. Under the direction of Lone Wolf the ruined Monastery of the Kai was rebuilt and restored to its former glory, and the raising of a New Order of Kai warriors was swiftly established. You are one of this new generation of Kai recruits. You were born in Sommerlund in the year MS 5063, during the time of the war against the Darklords. When you were seven years old you were sent by your father to the Kai Monastery. There, under the tutelage of Lone Wolf, you developed your martial skills and honed the special Kai abilities which lay dormant within you. During the years that followed, your skills were nurtured and sharpened to perfection by long hours of study and rigorous training. Your exceptional talents have helped you to master all of the Kai and Magnakai Disciplines, and you have risen swiftly through the ranks of the New Order to become one of only five who now hold the high rank of Kai Grand Master. It is an achievement which has brought great honour upon you and your family.</p>

     <p>In the year MS 5077 your skill and courage were put to the test when an attack was launched upon the Kai Monastery during Lone Wolf<ch.apos/>s absence. By means of a Shadow Gate (an astral corridor between the physical world of Magnamund and the many ethereal domains which lie beyond it), Naar sent forth a host of dragon-creatures to besiege the monastery and lay waste to all Sommerlund. He had chosen his time well, yet his evil plan was thwarted by the tenacious defence that you and your brethren maintained until the siege was raised by Lone Wolf and the King<ch.apos/>s Army of Sommerlund.</p>

     <p>During the six years that have elapsed since the defeat of his minions, Naar has endeavoured to enact his vengeance upon the Kai. He commands many agents of evil upon Magnamund, and they wait quietly in the shadows for the day when they may serve their fell master. One such agent was Lord Vandyan of Eldenora. Guided by Naar, Vandyan sought and found three ancient runes of evil. Empowered by his discoveries, Vandyan summoned a vast army of reptilian warriors<ch.emdash/>the Vorka<ch.emdash/>and he used them to conquer and occupy the lands of his peaceful neighbours. Emboldened by his martial successes, Vandyan then carried the war further afield.</p>

     <p>By mid-summer of this year his army had overrun much of central Magnamund, including the realm of Lyris<ch.emdash/>one of Sommerlund<ch.apos/>s oldest allies. From war-torn Lyris there arrived at the Kai Monastery an old man called Gwynian the Sage. He was a learned scholar and was revered by the Kai for he had aided Lone Wolf on many occasions in the past. He entreated your leader to help save his country from Vandyan<ch.apos/>s horde. Without hesitation, Lone Wolf pledged to mount a Kai crusade to raise the siege of Varetta, its capital city.</p>

     <p>The Vorka had been the key to Vandyan<ch.apos/>s military successes and he had a seemingly endless supply of these reptilian fighters. In order to defeat Vandyan and save Lyris, Lone Wolf knew that he had to cut off Vandyan<ch.apos/>s supply of Vorka reinforcements at their source. Gwynian had agents in Duadon, the capital of Eldenora, who had sent word that thousands of Vorka were being created inside the city. This was the source of the enemy<ch.apos/>s horde.</p>

     <p>Gwynian<ch.apos/>s agents in Duadon had confirmed that Vandyan<ch.apos/>s runes were being kept in the city<ch.apos/>s stronghold, a daunting fortress called Skull-Tor. Lone Wolf asked you to travel alone to Duadon to make contact with Gwynian<ch.apos/>s agents. They knew a secret route into the fortress and would help you to gain entry. Once inside, you were to find and destroy the runes as quickly as possible. Upon completion of the mission, the agents would assist you to evade Vandyan<ch.apos/>s troops. The thought of venturing hundreds of miles behind enemy lines to undertake such a dangerous quest filled you with a sense of foreboding. Yet, you also felt greatly honoured to have been chosen for the mission and you did not flinch from your duty.</p>

     <p>Your journey to Duadon was fraught with many perils, yet you overcame them all and made contact with Gwynian<ch.apos/>s agents. With their help you gained entry to Vandyan<ch.apos/>s stronghold of Skull-Tor and destroyed the evil runes, thereby extinguishing the source of the power by which the Vorka horde were permitted to exist. Vandyan<ch.apos/>s army dissolved and the Kai were then able to enter Lyris and raise the siege of Varetta.</p>

     <p>During your mission in Skull-Tor, you discovered that the Vorka were not the only creatures that Vandyan had summoned by the power of the runes. A demonic entity called Zorkaan the Soultaker had also been brought to Magnamund from his lair upon the Plane of Darkness<ch.emdash/>the ethereal domain of Naar. Having fought and defeated this creature, you believed that he had perished forever when subsequently you smashed the runes. Sadly, this was not so.</p>

     <p>Following your victory at Skull-Tor you were met by Guildmaster Banedon, the leader of Sommerlund<ch.apos/>s Guild of Magicians, who spirited you away from Duadon aboard his flying ship <cite>Cloud-dancer</cite>. Within minutes of your arrival aboard, a route was charted and a course set for the city of Varetta. The journey by air took little more than two hours and, although darkness had fallen, Banedon<ch.apos/>s skilled crewmen had little difficulty locating the city. Its siege-damaged walls were ringed with beacons of fire that were visible for fifty miles. As you drew closer, you saw the lifeless remains of the Vorka horde spread out across the plain surrounding Varetta, and the regiments of the allied armies marching proudly towards its gates. The beacons guided Banedon<ch.apos/>s craft towards the centre of the city where it was made to hover above the Halls of Learning, Gwynian<ch.apos/>s home. Swiftly you were lowered by cage to the grounds of this magnificent building where the New Order Kai were encamped. There you were greeted by the thunderous cheer of your fellow kinsmen, and the proud embrace of Lone Wolf and Gwynian the Sage. It was a joyful and victorious reunion, one that will live forever in your memory and in the legends of the New Order Kai.</p>

     <p>News of your arrival spread quickly through Varetta and you were f<ch.ecirc/>ted by its grateful citizens. By your brave action, the cruel siege of their city had been lifted. Following a night of celebration, Lone Wolf ordered you to return in triumph to the Kai Monastery aboard <cite>Cloud-dancer</cite>. He chose to ride home with the New Order and was expected to arrive in a week<ch.apos/>s time. Gladly you obeyed your leader<ch.apos/>s command, and shortly before noon you waved farewell to your proud brethren from the deck of Banedon<ch.apos/>s magnificent flying ship.</p>

     <p>Early the next day, you arrived at the Kai Monastery and delivered the glad news of your victory at Skull-Tor. Warmly the garrison praised your achievement and listened in awe when you recounted the details of your perilous mission. You informed them that Lone Wolf and the Kai crusaders were returning from Varetta and would arrive at the monastery in seven days<ch.apos/> time. You were the highest ranking Kai present at the monastery and so you took charge and oversaw preparations for their welcome home.</p>

     <p>Five days passed and the preparations were completed ahead of schedule. Everyone was looking forward with eager anticipation to their return. It was late that afternoon when a Kai scout called Gold Rain arrived unexpectedly at the monastery. His face and clothes were badly travel-stained, and it was clear from his state of near-exhaustion that he had ridden hard without rest. You were hoping that he had glad tidings, but you soon heard to the contrary; Gold Rain had grave and shocking news to impart.</p>

     <p>You learned that Lone Wolf had disappeared. During an overnight encampment on the outskirts of Ruanon, your leader had been abducted. Those who witnessed the abduction said that Lone Wolf was engulfed by a whirling black shadow that fell upon him from out of a stormy sky. So swift was the attack that your fellow Grand Masters were unable to prevent him from being carried away.</p>

     <p>A cold chill ran down your spine as you listened to Gold Rain<ch.apos/>s report. His description of the whirling black shadow was identical to the form adopted by Zorkaan the Soultaker. You were filled with a gnawing sense of doubt, a dire fear that the destruction of the rune used by Vandyan to summon Zorkaan did not bring about the fell creature<ch.apos/>s demise. Instead, it had trapped Zorkaan upon Magnamund. Immediately you suspected that Lone Wolf<ch.apos/>s abduction was an act of revenge. Your Kai Sixth Sense told you that Lone Wolf was still alive and present somewhere upon Magnamund, but you could not determine exactly where that place was.</p>

     <p>You had achieved a great victory at Duadon, but the shocking news of Lone Wolf<ch.apos/>s disappearance cast a deep shadow over your triumph there. You feared that the loss of your illustrious leader was too high a price to pay for the defeat of Vandyan and his Vorka hordes. Your natural instinct was to do everything in your power to find Lone Wolf and release him from his shadowy abductor, but you knew not where to look.</p>

     <p>Hurriedly you dispatched a rider to Toran and summoned Guildmaster Banedon to an emergency council at the Kai Monastery. He responded swiftly to your summons and arrived within hours aboard <cite>Cloud-dancer</cite>. He was accompanied by Lord Rimoah of Dessi, an Elder Magi magician who is also Lone Wolf<ch.apos/>s oldest friend and advisor.</p>

     <p>Rimoah confirmed your suspicions that Zorkaan had been summoned to Magnamund by the power of the runes. When you smashed the runes, this entity could not return to the Plane of Darkness from whence it had come. Inadvertently, your action had trapped Zorkaan upon Magnamund. The arrival upon your world of this powerful creature of evil had not gone unnoticed by the Elder Magi. From afar they had sensed Zorkaan<ch.apos/>s presence and, through the use of their Old Kingdom magic, Rimoah and his fellow elders had charted his movements. For a short while, following the destruction of the runes, the creature had roamed the planet freely. But his freedom was soon curtailed.</p>

     <p>Lord Rimoah then told you of an evil sorcerer called Xaol. He is a necromancer who dwells in hiding in Gazad Helkona, a former Darklord city-fortress located in the desolate wastes of northern Skaror. Xaol is also an agent of Naar who, since the demise of the Darklords, has patiently awaited the chance to serve his fell master. During the days before Lone Wolf<ch.apos/>s abduction, Rimoah and the Elder Magi detected streams of psychic communication coursing between Gazad Helkona and the Plane of Darkness.</p>

     <p><quote>Naar was transmitting to Xaol the secrets of a Ritual of Binding by which the freed spirit of Zorkaan could once again be enslaved,</quote> said Rimoah. <quote>We now know that this ritual was enacted successfully by Xaol in the stronghold of Gazad Helkona.</quote></p>

     <p><quote>Naar<ch.apos/>s insatiable thirst for revenge is a menace that Lone Wolf has had to live with since the day he destroyed the Dark God<ch.apos/>s champions,</quote> said Guildmaster Banedon. <quote>He maintains his vigilance against the constant threat of assassination by the agents of Naar, yet it seems he<ch.apos/>s been caught off-guard during the long march home to Sommerlund.</quote></p>

     <p><quote>Through the ritual enacted by Xaol, Naar has gained control over Zorkaan,</quote> replied Rimoah. <quote>He sent this creature to assassinate Lone Wolf at a Kai encampment near Ruanon, yet the attempt was unsuccessful. Zorkaan failed to kill Lone Wolf<ch.ellips/>but he was able to subdue and abduct him.</quote></p>

     <p><quote>So where is Lone Wolf now?</quote> you asked, anxiously.</p>

     <p><quote>He is imprisoned in Gazad Helkona,</quote> replied Rimoah, <quote>and he is in great peril. Only his Supreme Master Disciplines and the power of the Sommerswerd, his magical blade, have spared him from death by the hand of Naar<ch.apos/>s foul creation. Your leader is brave and resourceful, but I fear that Zorkaan<ch.apos/>s frequent attacks will weaken and eventually destroy Lone Wolf unless he is rescued quickly.</quote></p>

     <p>Selflessly you volunteered to attempt such a rescue. Rimoah and Banedon were impressed by your courage and your confidence, and readily they agreed to help you achieve this difficult task. Rimoah informed you that Gazad Helkona is occupied by Xaol and his cohorts, which comprise Hammerland bandits and remnants of the army of Darklord Chlanzor, the former ruler of this city-fortress.</p>

     <p><quote>The stronghold is located in a remote volcanic region, surrounded by a petrified forest from which it takes its name. It is a difficult place to reach and assault by force,</quote> said Rimoah.</p>

     <p><quote>But where an army may fail, a single Kai may triumph,</quote> interjected Banedon, wisely.</p>

     <p>At length you discussed the rescue and agreed upon a plan of action. Banedon will transport you aboard his flying ship <cite>Cloud-dancer</cite> to a valley in the Shezar Hills, situated fifty miles to the south of Gazad Helkona. Here you will disembark and then approach the fortress on foot. Banedon will remain aboard his flying ship, safely out of sight of Xaol<ch.apos/>s lookouts, where he will await a telepathic signal from Lone Wolf to confirm his rescue. Upon receiving this signal, he will bring <cite>Cloud-dancer</cite> into the centre of Gazad Helkona in order to collect you both. If you are unable to complete your mission to set Lone Wolf free, you must make your own way back to the flying ship.</p>

     <p>During your mission, Lord Rimoah and the Elder Magi will use their combined powers to disrupt the channel of communication that exists between Naar and his agent Xaol. Rimoah is confident that this action will serve to prevent Xaol from detecting the arrival of <cite>Cloud-dancer</cite>, and it will also help to keep secret your approach to his grim stronghold.</p>

    <data>
     <p>You keep a record of your adventure on the <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
     <p>During the years you have spent in training at the Kai Monastery, you have devoted yourself to further developing your fighting prowess (<typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ>) and physical stamina (<typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ>). Before you begin this <cite>New Order</cite> adventure you need to measure how effective your training has been. To do this take a pencil and, with your eyes closed, point the blunt end of it onto the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a>. If you pick a 0 it counts as zero.</p>
     <p>The first number that you pick from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> in this way represents your <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ>. Add 25 to the number you picked and write the total in the <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> section of your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a> (i.e. if your pencil fell on the number 7 in the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> you would write in a <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> of 32). When you fight, your <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> will be pitted against that of your enemy. A high score in this section is therefore desirable.</p>
     <p>The second number that you pick from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> represents your powers of <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ>. Add 30 to this number and write the total in the <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> section of your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a> (i.e. if your pencil fell on the number 8 on the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> you would have 38 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points).</p>
     <p>If you are wounded in combat you will lose <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points. If at any time your <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points fall to zero or below, you are dead and the adventure is over. Lost <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points can be regained during the course of the adventure, but your number of <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points cannot rise above the number you have when you start an adventure.</p>
     <p>If you have successfully completed previous adventures in the <cite>Lone Wolf New Order</cite> series (Books 21<ch.endash/>24), you can carry your current scores of <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> and <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points over to this adventure.<footref id="gamerulz-1" idref="gamerulz-1-foot"/> You may also carry over any Special Items, Kai Weapon, normal Weapons, and Backpack Items you had in your possession at the end of your last adventure, and these should be entered on your new <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
     <p><strong>Playing Tip:</strong> You may use a 10-sided die instead of the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> if you find it more convenient.</p>

       <p>It has long been the tradition of your <ch.eacute/>lite warrior caste to bestow a new name upon each young novice when they complete their first year<ch.apos/>s training at the Kai Monastery. Kai names are chosen by senior Kai Masters with the aim of reflecting the individual strengths and qualities of each novice.</p>
       <p>You may create your own Kai name for yourself, or you can generate a Kai name at random using the name tables below. To generate a Kai name, pick a number from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> and consult Table A. The name which corresponds to the number you have picked is the first part, or prefix, of your Kai name. Now pick a second number from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> and consult Table B. The name which corresponds to the number you have picked is the second part, or suffix, of your Kai name. Put the prefix and the suffix together and you have your own personal Kai name.</p>

        <p>Given the rules for the previous <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> books, it seems odd that a Grand Master is only allowed to choose to be proficient in one of the few Weapons listed in the <a idref="equipmnt">Equipment section</a>. In view of the unprecedented nature of this rule, you might decide that it is acceptable to be proficient in any of the ten Weapons that the Kai typically train to use.</p>

        <p>The rules in the Mongoose Publishing editions state that the bonus for Grand Weaponmastery with Bow is 5. Certain sections direct the reader to use different bonuses when using a Bow, ranging from 3 to 5, if you have Grand Weaponmastery with Bow. This may be the author adjusting the Grand Weaponmastery bonus on a case-by-case basis (and therefore this bonus should be used instead of the standard bonus) or an error (and therefore all of these bonuses should be 5). It is up to you to decide, but it seems most reasonable to follow the first alternative, to replace the Grand Weaponmastery bonus with whatever bonus is mentioned in that section.</p>

         <p>Following in the footsteps of Lone Wolf himself, you have vowed that one day you will become totally proficient in all 16 of the New Order Kai Grand Master Disciplines.

         <p>If this is the first <cite>New Order</cite> adventure you have undertaken, then your present rank is that of Kai Grand Master Senior. This means that you have mastered <em>four</em> of the New Order Grand Master Disciplines listed below. It is for you to decide which four Disciplines these are. As all of the New Order Grand Master Disciplines may be of use to you at some point during your mission, pick these four skills with care.

For every Grand Master Discipline you possess, in excess of the original four Disciplines you begin with, you may add 1 point to your basic <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> score and 2 points to your basic <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points score. These bonus points, together with your extra Grand Master Discipline(s), your original four Grand Master Disciplines, your Kai Weapon,<footref id="discplnz-3" idref="discplnz-3-foot"/> and any other Special Items and Backpack Items that you have found and been able to keep during your adventures, may then be carried over and used in the next <cite>New Order</cite> adventure, which is called: <bookref series ="lw" book="26tfobm"><cite>The Fall of Blood Mountain</cite>.</bookref></p>

       <p>Before you leave the Kai Monastery and begin your journey to Gazad Helkona, you equip yourself with a <a idref="map">map of that territory</a> and a pouch of gold. To find out how much gold is in the pouch, pick a number from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> and add 20 to the number you have picked. The total equals the number of Gold Crowns inside the pouch, and you should now enter this number in the <quote>Gold Crowns</quote> section of your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>. If you have successfully completed previous <cite>New Order</cite> adventures (Books 21<ch.endash/>24), you may add this sum to the number of Crowns you already possess. Fifty is the maximum number of Gold Crowns you can carry in your pouch at any time. You may also select five items from the list below, only two of which may be Weapons.</p>

         <p>Upon reaching the ultimate rank of Kai Supreme Master, Lone Wolf received as a reward from the God Kai many new skills and abilities. One of these skills was Kai Weaponcraft. Using his newfound mastery, Lone Wolf forged ten weapons of magical power in the armoury furnaces of the Kai Monastery. These magical weapons are reserved for the <ch.eacute/>lite of the New Order Kai who attain the rank of Grand Master.</p>

         <p>In recognition of your rank and achievement, you may choose your own Kai Weapon from the table below or, if you prefer, you can generate one at random. To generate a Kai Weapon, pick a number from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> and consult the first column. The magical Axe, Sword, or Broadsword which corresponds to the number you have picked will be your own personal Kai Weapon. Record this magical weapon and its unique properties in the Kai Weapon section of the <a idref="action">Special Items List</a>.<footref id="equipmnt-1" idref="equipmnt-1-foot"/></p>

         <p><strong>Example</strong></p>
         <p>Say you choose the number 1 from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a>, your Kai Weapon will be the Axe <quote>Alema</quote>.</p>

         <p>When using this Kai Weapon in normal combat you may add +5 points to your <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ>. Each Kai Weapon has a unique property. When you use your Kai Weapon in combat against the type of enemy that matches its unique property, or use it at the optimum time or location, then you may add the higher bonus to your <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ>.<footref id="equipmnt-2" idref="equipmnt-2-foot"/></p>

         <p><strong>Example</strong></p>
         <p>If you were to use <quote>Alema</quote> in combat against an undead enemy, you could add the higher bonus of +7 to your <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ>. If you were to fight a living enemy using this weapon then the bonus to your <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> would remain at +5.</p>

      <data>
       <p>There will be occasions during your adventure when you will have to fight an enemy. The enemy<ch.apos/>s <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> and <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points are given in the text. Your aim in the combat is to kill the enemy by reducing his <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points to zero while losing as few <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points as possible yourself.</p>
       <p>At the start of a combat, enter your own and the enemy<ch.apos/>s <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points in the appropriate boxes on the Combat Record section of your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
       <p>The sequence for combat is as follows:</p>
       <ol class="paragraphed">
        <li><p>Add any extra points gained through your Grand Master Disciplines and Special Items to your current <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> total.</p></li>
        <li>
         <p>Subtract the <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> of your enemy from this total. The result is your Combat Ratio. Enter it on the <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
         <p>Example</p>
         <p>You, Grand Master (<typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> 32), are attacked in a forest by a pack of Wild Dogs (<typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> 31). You are taken by surprise and are not given the opportunity of evading their attack. You possess the Grand Master Discipline of Kai-surge to which the Wild Dogs are not immune, so you add 8 points to your <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ>. You also possess the Kai Weapon <quote>Ulnarias</quote>, so you add an additional 5 points to your <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ>. This gives you a total <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> of 45.</p>
         <p>You now subtract the Wild Dogs<ch.apos/> <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> from your own, giving a Combat Ratio of +14 (45<ch.minus/>31=+14). +14 is noted on your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a> as the Combat Ratio.</p>
        </li>
        <li><p><a id="stage3">When you have your Combat Ratio</a>, pick a number from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a>.</p></li>
        <li>
         <p>Turn to the <a idref="crtable">Combat Results Table</a>. Along the top of the chart are shown the Combat Ratio numbers. Find the number that is the same as your Combat Ratio and cross-reference it with the random number that you have picked (the random numbers appear on the side of the chart). You now have the number of <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points lost by both yourself and your enemy in this round of combat. (E represents points lost by the enemy; GM represents points lost by yourself<ch.emdash/>Grand Master.)</p>
         <p>Example</p>
         <p>The Combat Ratio between you and the Wild Dogs has been established as +14. If the number picked from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> is 1, then the result of the first round of combat is:</p>
         <ul>
          <li>You (GM) lose 3 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points (plus an additional 1 point for using Kai-surge. This loss is in addition to the loss suffered as a result of combat).</li>
          <li>Wild Dogs lose 9 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points.</li>
         </ul>
        </li>
        <li><p>On the <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>, mark the changes in <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points to the participants in the combat.</p></li>
        <li><p>Unless otherwise instructed, or unless you have an option to evade, the next round of combat now starts.</p></li>
        <li><p>Repeat the sequence from <a idref="stage3">Stage 3</a>.</p></li>

       <p>This process of combat continues until the <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points of either your enemy or yourself are reduced to zero or below, at which point that combatant is declared dead. If you are declared dead, the adventure is over. If the enemy is dead, you can proceed but with your <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points possibly reduced.</p>

         <p>During your adventure you may be given the chance to evade combat. If you have already engaged in a round of combat and decide to evade, calculate the combat for that round in the usual manner. All points lost by the enemy as a result of that round are ignored, and you make your escape. Only <strong>you</strong> may lose <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points during that round (such is the risk of turning tail and running away during combat!). You may only evade if the text of the particular section allows you to do so.</p>

         <p>If you are a New Order Kai who has attained the rank of Kai Grand Master Superior, you will now benefit from improvements to the following Grand Master Disciplines:</p>
         <dl class="paragraphed">
          <dt>Animal Mastery</dt>
           <dd><p>Kai Grand Master Superiors who possess this Discipline are able to deter predatory animals in the wild by exuding a scent which is repellent to them. In order for this improved Discipline to work effectively, a Kai Grand Master Superior must be aware of the species of predatory animal he/she wishes to deter. The scent can only be detected by the targeted animal.</p></dd>
          <dt>Assimilance</dt>
           <dd><p>Kai Grand Master Superiors who possess this skill are able to create a noise and project it up to 15 yards away from their location. The noise is akin to the rumbling sound of thunder and it can be used to distract or divert an enemy<ch.apos/>s attention. This improved Discipline requires a degree of preparation and therefore it cannot be used during combat.</p></dd>
          <dt>Astrology</dt>
           <dd><p>Kai Grand Master Superiors who possess this Discipline are skilled in the use of all mechanical devices designed to measure and/or observe the cosmology of Magnamund. Such devices include sextants, astrolabes, and orreries.</p></dd>
          <dt>Herbmastery</dt>
           <dd><p>Kai Grand Master Superiors who have this Discipline are able to purify water, thereby making contaminated or briny water suitable for consumption. Roughly two pints of water per day can be purified using this skill alone. This daily total steadily increases as a Grand Master advances in rank.</p></dd>
          <dt>Elementalism</dt>
           <dd><p>Kai Grand Master Superiors who possess this skill are able to condense pure water out of the surrounding air. This water can be made to fall as a fine spray or as a sudden deluge. It can also be made to fill any suitable container or receptacle. Using this skill, Grand Master Superiors can create the equivalent of one large bucketful of fresh water.</p></dd>
          <dt>Bardsmanship</dt>
           <dd><p>Kai Grand Master Superiors who possess this Discipline are able to utilize their musical skills to pacify an excited or hostile animal.</p></dd>

           <dd><p>Kai Grand Sentinels who possess this skill are able to predict the weather accurately for the forthcoming 3 hours. The range of this ability is an area 10 square miles around the Kai Grand Sentinel. Duration and range steadily increase as a Kai Grand Master rises in rank.</p></dd>
          <dt>Astrology</dt>
           <dd><p>Kai Grand Sentinels who possess this Discipline are able to detect psychic residues left on an object by its owner. The more valuable the object is to its owner, the stronger will be the lingering psychic attachment. The majority of everyday or shared objects do not retain such residues.</p></dd>
          <dt>Herbmastery</dt>
           <dd><p>Through their knowledge and use of common plants, Kai Grand Sentinels who have this Discipline are able to make contaminated or rotten food fit for human consumption.</p></dd>

          <dt>Elementalism</dt>
           <dd><p>By using this Discipline, Kai Grand Defenders are able to summon up a dense, misty vapour to obscure themselves from both normal vision and infravision (night sight).

     <p>The success of your mission to find and free your illustrious leader is one of vital importance. Lone Wolf<ch.apos/>s abductor is a powerful and formidable adversary, and your search will be fraught with danger at every turn. Be wary and on your guard at all times during your exploration of Gazad Helkona.</p>

     <p>During your search, some of the material items that you will encounter will be of use to you, but some may be red herrings of no real value at all. If you discover items during your mission, be selective in what you choose to keep. Pick your four Grand Master Disciplines with care for a wise choice will enable anyone to complete the quest, no matter how weak their initial <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> and <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> scores may be. Completion of previous <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> adventures (Books 1<ch.endash/>24) may be advantageous, but it is not essential for the successful completion of this <cite>New Order</cite> adventure.</p>

     <p>Grand Master<ch.emdash/>may the light of the Gods Kai and Ishir guide you safely during your mission.</p>

       <p>You decide to begin your air voyage to the Shezar Hills at first light the following day. In the few hours which remain before dawn, both you and Banedon make final preparations for the long journey west. You summon to your chambers Winter Oak, a Kai Archmaster, and tell him of the mission you are about to undertake at daybreak. He is the most senior member of the garrison and you place him in command during your absence. The Kai crusaders are expected to arrive in two days<ch.apos/> time, and it will be his duty to inform them of your whereabouts and to keep the monastery safe until you and Lone Wolf return.</p>
       <p>Having completed your preparations, you sleep for a few hours and rise shortly before dawn. Lord Rimoah escorts you to the monastery training park where, hovering above, you see the sleek hull of <cite>Cloud-dancer</cite> glinting in the moonlight. Rimoah has chosen not to accompany you on the voyage. Instead, he will remain here at the monastery and maintain contact with Banedon by means of a seeing stone. One of the ship<ch.apos/>s lookouts sees you crossing the park below and he orders a boarding cage to be lowered from the stern deck. As you wait for it to touch the ground, Rimoah takes from his pocket a sigil of platinum fixed upon a loop of braided twine. He presses the amulet into your hand and insists that you wear it at all times.</p>
       <p><quote>It is an artefact imbued with Old Kingdom magic,</quote> he says, sagely. <quote>It has protective powers that may help you when you enter Gazad Helkona. Lone Wolf possesses a similar sigil, and I am sure that it has helped him to resist Zorkaan thus far.</quote></p>
       <p>You accept the sigil and slip its braided noose over your head. (Record this Platinum Amulet on your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a> as a Special Item which you wear around your neck. You need not discard another Special Item in its favour if you already hold the maximum number permissible.)</p>

Carefully, you push open the door and enter a spacious chamber that is lit by ten globes of flickering white light. They hang suspended in the air with no visible means of support. The walls of this chamber are plastered and decorated with murals that depict the armies of Darklord Chlanzor despoiling the farms and cities of the Freeland Alliance. Standing against the far wall is a throne-like chair, crudely fashioned from a huge block of black marble. Veins of fluorescent purples and greens colour its surface, and the air around it shimmers like a desert haze.</p>

       <p>Warily you explore this narrow tunnel, and as you advance deeper into the darkness, you detect the sickly aroma of mould and decay. Bones crunch beneath your boots and the walls become thickly coated with a pallid grey moss. At length you are brought to a halt when the passage arrives at a dead end. You examine the mossy wall ahead, and your tracking skills help you to uncover a loose brick that conceals a length of rotting cord. You tug this cord and it triggers a hidden counterweight that causes the whole wall to revolve on a central hinge. Squeezing through the narrow gap, you enter a dark chamber that lies beyond. A few moments later, you hear the cogs of the counterweight resetting. Then the secret panel revolves about its hinge and locks behind you.</p>

       <p>Using your infravision, you scan your surroundings and discover that you have entered a hall that is flanked on either side by a row of human skeletons. They stand at attention with their spines pressed against the stone wall, and clasped in their bony hands are rusty polearms of differing type and origin. At the far end of this hall, you can see a pair of stout wooden doors reinforced with strips of polished steel. Cautiously you advance under the sightless gaze of the flanking skeletons, and upon reaching the doors you discover that they are secured by a combination lock. A single dial with a brass pointer is mounted upon a circular plate that is numbered 0 to 200 around its bevelled edge. You place the palm of your hand against the door, and a tingle of excitement runs down your spine when you sense that Lone Wolf is being held captive on the other side of these doors.</p>
       <p>With the help of your Kai Sixth Sense, you determine that the number which will open the combination lock is the same as the solution to the following puzzle.</p>
       <p>If A=1, B=2, C=3 (and so on through the alphabet until you reach Z=26), what is the total numerical value of the fortress of GAZAD HELKONA?</p>

       <p>The dial clicks into its correct position,<footref id="sect12-1" idref="sect12-1-foot"/> and the concealed section of the wall creaks open to reveal a dark and narrow passage. You enter this secret tunnel and ascend a long stone ramp to a wider section of the passage, lit faintly by a strange ochre glow. This murky light radiates from clumps of bacteria that are thriving on the dank walls.</p>
       <p>At once you recognize the bacteria to be Gnallia, a benign bacillus that is often used to prevent and cure infections of the blood. The raw bacteria are edible and rich in protein, and there is sufficient here for 5 Meals. If you wish to keep some of this Gnallia, record it in the Meals section of your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>. Each Meal of Gnallia will restore 2 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points.</p>
       <p>At length the passage comes to an end at a narrow door. At your approach, this portal slides open to reveal a winding stone staircase. You step out of the passageway and, as you turn to climb the stairs, you hear the portal sliding shut behind you. Cautiously you ascend the steps until they come to an end at a circular landing.</p>

       <p>You use your Magnakai Curing skills in an urgent attempt to restore Lone Wolf to consciousness. You unbutton the front of his battle-tunic and place your hands on his chest; then you transfer the warmth of your healing powers directly into his body (this use of your Discipline costs you 3 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points). After a few minutes you feel his heartbeat growing stronger, yet before you can complete the healing procedure, you hear the daunting sound of steel-shod boots echoing up the shaft from below. You risk a glance over the parapet of the stairs and you see a dozen armoured Drakkarim emerging from the tunnel at the base of the shaft. As they come running up the stairs, you see that many of them are armed with loaded crossbows.</p>
       <p>Reluctantly you are forced to abandon your attempt to revive Lone Wolf. You heave him across your shoulder and take to the stairs once more, climbing as fast as your aching legs will carry you both towards the observatory roof, 60 feet above.</p>

       <p>Having incapacitated the tower lookout, you squeeze through the arrow slit and jump down into the chamber. The moment your feet touch the flagstones, you hear a high-pitched squeak somewhere above your head. You glance up and a shadowy blur flashes before your eyes. It is followed almost immediately by a sharp stabbing pain that runs all the way from your neck to your stomach. Something small and furry has attached itself to the flesh beneath your jaw, and it is feeding hungrily on your blood.</p>
       <p>Instinctively you take hold of the creature with both hands and crush it in a vice-like grip. You hear its bones crack and you feel it go limp, and then you detach it carefully from your neck and hurl its lifeless body to the floor. A wave of nausea wells up in the pit of your stomach and you feel your punctured neck begin to swell alarmingly. Your Magnakai Discipline of Curing slows the effect of the creature<ch.apos/>s venom, but you have been gravely weakened by this unexpected attack and you feel barely able to remain standing.</p>

Beyond the Drakkarim, you can see an archway in the opposite wall which leads to a flight of stone steps.

       <p>You shout out the words of the Brotherhood Spell <spell>Lightning Hand</spell> and take aim with your right hand at the smoking orb. A crackling bolt of energy leaps from your palm and strikes the deadly device. The impact splits the orb asunder and ignites the explosive fluid contained within. The Kraan and its rider are caught by the ensuing blast, and they are consumed in a roaring ball of flame. With grim satisfaction you watch as they spiral down into an avenue that is crowded with Hammerland bandits, enticed from their barracks by the spectacle of your dramatic air escape.</p>

       <p>Your Magnakai Discipline of Pathsmanship warns you of an impending ambush, but you cannot determine the direction of the threat. You are peering into the curtain of webs, in search of the source of the movement that you detected moments ago, when suddenly you hear a noise. It comes from behind you.</p>
       <p>Swiftly, you spin around to see that a large section of the ground has opened up like a great trapdoor. From its subterranean lair, a colossal black spider hoists itself out of the ground and perches on the lip of the dark aperture. Swivelling on jointed legs, this titanic arachnid clacks its fanged maw as it fixes you with a cluster of crimson eyes that rotate and pulsate hypnotically.</p>

It is a Kraan, a vile breed that was spawned and used by the Darklords to provide flying mounts for their Giak and Drakkarim armies. Darklord Zagarna mustered many thousands of these beasts when he invaded Sommerlund, and it was their assault by air which resulted in the destruction of the Kai Monastery. Some of the Kraan survived the fall of Helgedad and the demise of their Darklord masters, and you think it likely that this one has come from Gazad Helkona and was out scouting for food.

Fifty feet below the platform is a broad thoroughfare that is busy with the traffic of bandit columns and Hammerland wagons newly-arrived from Cragmantle.

       <p>The narrow bridge arcs towards the citadel platform, but its smooth span is broken in the middle by a hinged drawbridge. It is open and it hangs down, creating a gap at the apex that is 15 feet wide. You observe that this banded iron flap is operated by two heavy chains that run beneath the span. You magnify your vision and trace their route back to the base of a plinth which stands on the blockhouse platform, close by the entrance to the bridge. A winch handle protrudes from this plinth, but when you attempt to crank the chains taut, you find that it will not budge: it is locked in position.

       <p>At first you think you have found a large coin wedged under the door, but when you hook it with your fingernails and drag it out, you discover that this gold-plated disc is a cloak brooch. It is embellished with the insignia of a wolf<ch.apos/>s head on a radiant sun, and instantly you recognize this emblem. It is the personal mark of Lone Wolf. Elated by your discovery, you take the brooch and press it to your forehead. Your Kai senses confirm your suspicion that this item was not lodged beneath the door by accident. Lone Wolf purposefully hid the brooch here in the hope that it would assist those who might attempt to rescue him.</p>

A crackling sound makes you look to the black marble throne where a strange manifestation is taking place. The seat is filled by a ball of shimmering energy that slowly grows and transforms into a living creature. You gasp with shock when this nightmarish entity raises itself out of the throne and comes stalking towards you on two muscular legs.</p>
       <p>Despite its crouching gait, the creature stands an arm<ch.apos/>s length taller than you. Its shiny crimson hide is thickly veined, and its snake-like head is studded with hundreds of razor-sharp barbs that sparkle like diamonds when they catch the light. It fixes you with a hungry stare and slashes at the air with its claw-tipped forearms. You retreat before its steady advance and tug your Kai Weapon from its scabbard in readiness to defend yourself against this monstrous entity. As you raise your blade, the creature utters a sound that resembles a deep, bubbling laugh. It opens its soot-blackened jaw and a gout of flame comes shooting towards your face. You react in an instant, your lightning-fast reflexes saving you from being incinerated by the beast<ch.apos/>s fiery breath. You dive and roll across the floor towards the chamber wall, and then you spring back onto your feet and launch a furious attack at the creature before it can spit a second blast of white-hot fire.</p>

       <p>When the dial clicks into position,<footref id="sect105-1" idref="sect105-1-foot"/> the heavy wooden doors swing open and a gust of putrid air makes you swallow hard before you take your first cautious step into the hall beyond. You cast a suspicious eye around this circular chamber for it is illuminated by tall candles that radiate a cold, cyanic light. The floor is strewn with bones and human cadavers in varying states of decomposition, and the walls are hung with great silken tapestries depicting horrific scenes that glorify the power of death and decay.</p>
       <p>As your eagle eyes penetrate the gloom, your pulse races when they fall upon Lone Wolf. He sits cross-legged within a sphere of translucent grey light that hovers three feet above the floor. His divine blade, Sommerswerd, is cradled in his lap, and his head hangs limply against his chest. At first you believe he is unconscious; then your Magnakai Discipline of Psi-screen detects that he is engaged in a desperate mental battle against a host of invisible enemies who are seeking to enslave his soul.</p>

       <p>The shadowy prison-sphere that entraps Lone Wolf hovers before a vile throne constructed entirely of human skulls and bones. Seated here is a thin man attired in black robes edged with gold and scarlet braid. His pale skin and feverish dark eyes are touched by the bluish glow of the surrounding candles, accentuating his sinister mien. With an extended right hand he grasps the surface of a large crystal sphere that is fixed to a pedestal beside his throne. This crystal is hollow, but its core is filled with swirling black vapours that radiate a deathly chill. The robed man stares fixedly at the sphere and appears to be mesmerized by it. You magnify your vision, and when you focus your gaze upon the sphere, suddenly you fathom the secret of the terrible power contained within.</p>

       <p>You make your way to a ring of boulders near the exit from the gully where patiently you wait for the storm to abate. When finally the wind drops and the air sheds its dust, you are able to see the vast forest of Helkona stretching away to the northern horizon. It is a forbidding sight, a lifeless expanse of petrified trees that have been destroyed by poisons leeched from the blighted soil of the Darklands. You climb atop a boulder, and when you magnify your vision, you are able to make out a crimson speck of light in the far distance. It emanates from the towers of Gazad Helkona, which you estimate to be no more than thirty miles away. This pinpoint glow of blood-red light tells you that the fortress is occupied.</p>
       <p>It is dark and cloudy, yet even in the dead of night the skies above this region are dully illuminated by the reflection of volcanic fires that rage amidst the surrounding mountains. When you glance to the east you can see the lava streams of the Kagazitzaga Range; to the west, you see the fiery spouts of the Kokozritzaga. As you approach the twisted tree-line of Helkona, you can feel the constant tremor of their eruptions vibrating beneath your feet.</p>

       <p>Your Kai Mastery informs you that Lone Wolf is somewhere nearby. Encouraged by this feeling of certainty, you close your eyes and take hold of the Platinum Amulet that Lord Rimoah gave you before you left the monastery.

You feel the faint warmth of Lone Wolf<ch.apos/>s aura, but it is too weak for you to be sure of the direction you should follow. All that you can determine is that your leader cannot be found behind the left door.</p>

       <p>You examine the rune-carved wall and discover a hollow which contains a shiny black amulet engraved with the spider-and-blazing-sun emblem of Darklord Chlanzor. It feels unusually cold to the touch, as if this item has been kept packed in ice. (If you wish to keep this Black Amulet, record it on your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a> as a Special Item which you carry in the pocket of your tunic.)</p>

       <p>Lone Wolf bids you follow as he steps through a shattered pane of the dome and climbs out onto the platform that encircles the observatory tower. The wild, sulphurous winds rip at your cloak and tunic, forcing you to crouch down and grasp the iron platform with both hands for fear of being blown over the edge. Yet these powerful winds do not seem to affect your leader. He stands erect and immobile, as if cast in solid stone. With an unblinking gaze he stares fixedly towards the southern horizon, his eagle eyes searching out Banedon<ch.apos/>s skycraft.</p>
       <p>Little more than twenty minutes have elapsed when Lone Wolf turns and looks down at your crouching form. <thought>Banedon approaches,</thought> he says, his silent words forming in your mind. You magnify your vision and scan the southern vista, but you are unable to discern a skyship among the roiling black clouds. Then you spot a sliver of light in the stormy sky, and your spirits rise. The <cite>Cloud-dancer</cite> is fast approaching.</p>
       <p>Guided by the pulsating glow of the observatory<ch.apos/>s crimson beacon, and Lone Wolf<ch.apos/>s telepathic messages, Banedon is able to bring the <cite>Cloud-dancer</cite> to within 50 feet of the dome. But the fierce winds prevent him from making a landing, and so he has his crew lower the boarding cage. The moment it sets down upon the platform, you follow Lone Wolf inside and slam shut the gate. There is a jolt as the hawser tenses, and then you feel the cage swaying the moment it is hoisted off the platform. Despite the violent swaying of the cage, you feel elated when you look through the bars of the cage door and see the shattered dome of the observatory receding beneath you. Then the exhilaration of your escape from Gazad Helkona is shattered when you hear a hideous shriek rise above the roar of the wind.</p>

       <p>A short flight of iron steps ascends to a long, low-ceilinged hall. Its plastered walls are decorated with frescoes that depict enslaved humans, bedecked with chains and heads bowed in defeat, parading in a line before a triumphant group of Drakkarim warlords. At the far end of this hall you discover three identical doors recessed into the wall.</p>

Cautiously you pull its stopper to sniff the contents, and you are pleasantly surprised to discover that it contains a tincture of Laumspur. It is old and stale, but it still possesses some of its healing powers. (This Decanter contains the equivalent of two doses of Laumspur.

       <p>As you trudge along the rutted trail, you become aware that the night sky is beginning to brighten. Somewhere high above the perpetual blanket of cloud that engulfs this hateful territory, day is breaking. At length, the trail arrives at a junction where another broad track joins it from the west. There are no signposts to mark the way, but your Kai sense of direction steers you towards the east where a long slope ascends to a treeless ridge. When you come to the crest of this ridge and look beyond, you catch your first glimpse of the imposing walls of Gazad Helkona.</p>
       <p>The broad-based fortress squats in a basin of rock at the centre of the petrified forest. Its coal-black walls are cracked and crumbling like some fossilized relic that is riddled with decay. Within its curtain wall, with its decrepit watchtowers and great iron gate, there are scores of minarets and needle-spires that seem to scratch malevolently at the passing clouds. You magnify your vision and you see that the emblem of Darklord Chlanzor is still emblazoned upon the rust-red surface of the fortress gate. It resembles a great black spider perched upon the surface of a blazing sun. Chlanzor may no longer be the commander of this stronghold, but the legacy of his rule remains.</p>

       <p>You observe the fortress for several minutes and take in every detail of its foul design. The great gate is secure and well guarded, but you note two places where you may be able to effect an entry without being seen. The first is a breach to the west of the gate, where the wall has been undermined by a fissure of lava. The second is a great mound of rubble to the east of the gate, the remains of the upper storeys of a collapsed watchtower. By climbing the mound you could gain access to the fortress through an arrow slit.</p>

Then you jab your fist towards the speeding orb and a knot of concussive energy leaps from your knuckles to strike the deadly device. The force of its impact splits the orb asunder and ignites the explosive fluid that it contains. The Kraan and its rider are caught by the ensuing blast and consumed in a roaring ball of flame. With grim satisfaction you watch as they spiral down into an avenue that is crowded with Hammerland bandits, enticed from their barracks by the spectacle of your dramatic air escape.</p>

When you leave the carcass and approach the crushed remains of the second body, your stomach churns when you recognize its scaly, bat-winged form. It is a Kraan, a vile breed that was spawned and used by the Darklords to provide flying mounts for their Giak and Drakkarim armies. Darklord Zagarna mustered many thousands of these beasts when he invaded Sommerlund, and it was their assault by air which resulted in the destruction of the Kai Monastery. Some of the Kraan survived the fall of Helgedad and the demise of their Darklord masters, and you think it likely that this one has come from Gazad Helkona and was out scouting for food. The third carcass is also that of a Kraan, but unlike the other, this one is equipped with a crude leather harness and collar.</p>

       <p>When you look to the top of the shaft, you can see the huge domed panels of the citadel<ch.apos/>s observatory windows. Confident that an escape onto the roof can be effected by this route, you resolve to reach the top of the stairs as quickly as you can. However, you are becoming increasingly concerned for Lone Wolf<ch.apos/>s physical condition. His pulse is weak and his breathing is shallow, indicating to you that he is slipping from unconsciousness into coma. You are also anxious to revive him so that he may send a telepathic signal to Guildmaster Banedon, summoning him to your rescue. Unless this signal is transmitted soon, you fear that any attempt to reach the roof will ultimately be to no avail.</p>

Fortunately, they are poorly aimed and none of them find their mark. Lone Wolf weaves a pattern with his hands and three of the Kraan come to an abrupt halt, as if the stormy air has suddenly turned to glass and imprisoned them. Meanwhile, you focus your attention upon a Kraan that is swooping down from the clouds above on a collision course with the cage. Its rider is carrying a smoking black orb fixed to a long length of chain. Impact looks imminent until, at the very last moment, the Drakkar tugs on the reins and the Kraan veers away. As it turns, the Drakkar releases the orb and sends it hurtling towards the boarding cage door.</p>

       <p>You lash out at the Krorn with the toe of your boot and strike it a glancing blow to the side of its head. The creature utters a guttural cry and staggers backwards into the chamber, clutching its bruised head with its ham-like fists. You force yourself through the narrow aperture and jump down into the chamber, but the moment your feet hit the flagstones you hear a high-pitched squeak somewhere above your head. You glance up and a shadowy blur flashes before your eyes. It is followed almost immediately by a sharp stabbing pain that runs all the way from your neck to your stomach. Something small and furry has attached itself to the flesh beneath your jaw, and it is feeding hungrily on your blood.</p>
       <p>Instinctively you take hold of the creature with both hands and crush it in a vice-like grip.

       <p>Cautiously you approach the open archway and peer around its stone jamb. Beyond the tower entrance you can see a flagstoned plaza that is adjacent to the main gate. Here you see Hammerland bandits drawing pails of dirty grey water from a well by the south perimeter wall, and a dozen hungry Giaks squabbling over the gangrenous remains of a wolfhound carcass.</p>
       <p>You scan the streets of this grim city-fortress and note that there are no individual dwellings here. The buildings of Gazad Helkona are grouped into four vast hexagonal blockhouse complexes, each topped by a cluster of minarets and spires. They are connected to one another by bridges that span the wide avenues between. At the centre of the stronghold is a massive octagonal citadel. A broad ramp leads to its portcullised gate which is guarded by a troop of fifty armoured sentries. As you observe the citadel, you sense a powerful concentration of evil lurking somewhere within its jet-black walls. Its highest level is dominated by a domed observatory which emits a pulsating crimson light. Your Sixth Sense tells you that Lone Wolf is being held captive somewhere within this edifice, and it hardens your resolve to rescue him.</p>

       <p>The creature sees your blade spinning end-over-end towards its face and quickly it crouches down to avoid it. Your Weapon grazes its skull as it streaks past; then it hits one of the narrow stone pillars which support the glass dome. With a loud <onomatopoeia>Clang!</onomatopoeia> it ricochets off the stonework and skitters across the floor.</p>
       <p>With a quiet, mocking laugh, the Urgaroh rises up and takes aim at you with its crystal rod. Moments later, a fiery missile erupts from its tip and comes speeding across the platform towards your face.</p>

On reaching the opposite platform, you stop to check that the coast is clear before entering the citadel of Gazad Helkona.</p>

The walls, ceiling, and floor are all constructed from dull volcanic stone, and several pieces of black wooden furniture are scattered haphazardly around the room. Beside a heavy wooden door there stands an ebony bookshelf that is filled with stoppered vials. Carefully you rest Lone Wolf down upon a divan before you examine the individual contents of these glass containers.</p>

       <p>Your killing below brings Xaol staggering to his knees, gasping hoarsely. He drops his serpent staff and the instant it leaves his grasp, it shrivels up into a tight ball that hisses, smokes, and bubbles. Xaol falls to one side, his gaunt shaven head striking the bone-littered floor with a dull thud. Through blood-flecked lips he utters a curse, vowing one day to return from beyond the grave to wreak bloody vengeance upon you and the Kai. Then his dark eyes flicker and glaze over, and his thin frame convulses for a moment and falls still.</p>
       <p>You leap over the withered remains of the necromancer and his cursed staff, and rush towards Lone Wolf. Slowly your master raises his tousled head and fixes you with his steely blue eyes. You sense that he has been greatly weakened by his ordeal. He has suffered much since his abduction, yet he has found the strength within himself to resist his cruel tormentors. Inspired by his resolute courage, you ask how you can free him from the prison-sphere. Lone Wolf mouths a reply, but you cannot hear him. Using your Magnakai Discipline of Divination you try to detect telepathic communication, but you sense that it is futile. No mind speech can penetrate the milky grey walls of Lone Wolf<ch.apos/>s hovering prison. Then your leader glowers at the crystal sphere that is fixed atop a pedestal beside the throne of bones, and instantly you fathom his meaning. Slowly you mouth the words: <quote>Must I destroy the sphere?</quote> Lone Wolf nods approvingly. Fired up by his directive, you raise your Kai Weapon and approach the crystal sphere. But before you come to within striking distance, a powerful gust of freezing air hits you in the chest and sends you reeling backwards to the floor.</p>

       <p>Cold sweat trickles down your face as you contemplate what could have constructed such a large and intricate web. Then your heart skips a beat when suddenly you detect movement within it.</p>

       <p>You follow a short semicircular tunnel that leads to a wide gallery encircling the upper section of a colossal hall. Peering over the parapet of the gallery, you look down on the red granite floor of the hall 50 feet below. Here you see Drakkarim and Giaks standing in idle groups around the lip of a deep lava-filled pit that looks as if it could descend all the way to the molten core of Magnamund. Motes of rust-coloured dust cling to every surface and the scorching air reeks of molten metal and sulphur.</p>
       <p>An unbroken line of fiery bronze statues encircle the gallery, depicting former loyal servants of Darklord Chlanzor. You are casting your eye along their line when suddenly you see two of Xaol<ch.apos/>s henchmen. They emerge from a passageway located next to a spiral staircase on the far side of the gallery. Quickly you take cover behind the nearest statue and watch as those two men, accompanied by a wolfhound, come walking around the gallery towards your hiding place.</p>

Most of its sticky fibres adhere to the parapet rail or are deflected down into the well of the shaft. The few strands that do fix themselves to the Drakkar<ch.apos/>s body are swiftly sundered by a few blows from his serrated sword. Your spell has delayed his advance for a few moments, but that is all. Having cut his way clear, the Drakkar continues to advance determinedly towards the observatory platform.</p>

Twice in the tunnel you are forced to use your Magnakai Invisibility skills in order to avoid a confrontation with Drakkarim and Hammerland bandits.

Most of the tomes are badly burnt or have crumbled with age and neglect, but there is one on a high shelf that is still intact. Curiosity prompts you to retrieve and open this book, and inside you discover a phial of blue liquid wedged in a hollow gouged from the vellum pages. You withdraw the phial and hold it up to the torchlight, and immediately your Magnakai Curing skills inform you that this is Finglas<ch.emdash/>a rare and powerful healing potion.

       <p>You retrieve the Sommerswerd from the ground and marvel at its craftsmanship and fine balance. Then you hurry to the prison-sphere and thrust the tip of the golden blade into a ragged tear that was made when Lone Wolf hurled the Sommerswerd at Zorkaan. Crimson sparks erupt from the rent in the sphere as determinedly you work the sword with a sawing motion. The split lengthens until you are able to reach in and grab hold of Lone Wolf<ch.apos/>s tunic. Carefully you pull your unconscious leader out of his sorcerous cell, and then you sheathe the Sommerswerd in his scabbard before you heave his limp body over your shoulder. Fearing that Xaol<ch.apos/>s absence may soon come to the attention of his minions, you cast your gaze around the necromancer<ch.apos/>s hall in search of a way to escape. The doors by which you entered have been sealed shut, but your keen eyes and your Kai senses alert you to two other possible routes out of this chamber.

       <p>With fearful disquiet, you take your first faltering steps into the dead forest of Helkona. This timberland reeks of sulphurous decay, and the perpetual half-light of the Darklands lends it a fearsome aspect. Guided by your Kai tracking instincts, you forge a northerly course through this poisoned maze of twisted trunks and thorn-guarded scrub, until you are halted by a violent tremor that makes the ground heave and split. You grab at a knotted bough to stop yourself from falling, but the rotten wood crumbles in your hand and you are knocked off your feet. Close by, a fissure opens in the dusty ground, and from its depths there emerges a host of giant black flies. They take to the air and swarm above you, their ghost-grey wings buzzing loudly. You sense that they are hungry and are preparing to launch an attack.</p>

       <p>Spatters of molten rock rain down from the sky to sear your neck and shoulders: lose 2 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points. Frantically you scramble to your feet and run blindly through the trees in desperation to escape this unexpected deluge of fire. All around you, the tinder-dry wood is being ignited by droplets of red-hot lava. Trees crackle and explode, spreading the fire with alarming speed. You dare not stop as you race through the raging flames and escape towards the north.</p>
       <p>After what seems like hours, the tremors cease and the hungry flames recede. Gasping for breath, you stop to rest in a shallow rocky basin that is ringed by fallen trees. You must now eat a Meal or lose 3 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points (you cannot use Grand Huntmastery in this instance, for there are no flora or fauna that you can forage for in the petrified forest of Helkona).</p>
       <p>Feeling revived after your brief rest, you decide to leave the basin and climb the tallest of the nearby trees in the hope that you can pinpoint your present location. Your effort is rewarded when you see the uppermost towers of Gazad Helkona rising above the tree-line less than fifteen miles to the northeast. With luck you should reach the fortress within four hours.</p>
       <p>It is only an hour later when you happen upon a broad track through the forest. Its loose surface is rutted with wagon tracks, and when you look more closely, you discover evidence of traffic having passed this way recently in both directions. Bordering upon this trail are several prickly shrubs which are covered with tiny purple buds.</p>

       <p>You scour the gallery in case the bandits were not alone, but the upper reaches of this hall are empty and you feel confident that your confrontation has not been witnessed. To avoid the risk of their bodies being discovered, you dispose of them by lifting each one onto your shoulder and heaving them over the balcony. They drop into the fiery pit that blazes in the hall below, and are quickly consumed by the flames. Then you hurry around the gallery to the staircase opposite.</p>
       <p>Here you discover a short flight of iron steps that ascend to a long, low-ceilinged hall. This hall has plastered walls which are decorated with frescoes depicting enslaved humans, bedecked with chains and heads bowed in defeat, parading in a line before a triumphant group of Drakkarim warlords. At the far end of this hall you discover three identical doors recessed into the painted wall.</p>

There is no lock, so you push open the heavy portal with your shoulder and enter a dark hall beyond. The vast chamber is dominated by a circular stone plinth that occupies the middle of a floor strewn with dung and bones. The ceiling overhead is more than 100 feet high, and its upper level is encircled by open portals through which you can see the brooding clouds. You look around this gloomy chamber and notice an arched stairwell directly opposite the door by which you have entered. There is a sticky, unwholesome warmth about this place, and a stale smell that is redolent of rotting meat.</p>

       <p>To your horror, you see a Kraan come gliding down onto an exterior platform that runs around the perimeter of the observatory dome. Astride its scaly back is a skull-faced reptilian that is swathed in ragged, funereal robes. It leaps down from the saddled Kraan and, as it crouches on the windswept platform, it levels a rod of glowing crystal at the transparent dome. A flash of sparkling light erupts at the tip of this rod, and a section of the glass wall explodes into a million razor shards. Instinctively you shield your face with your forearm as the deadly splinters of glass come hurtling through the air towards you, driven by the force of the explosion and the gale-force winds that rage around the observatory tower.</p>

       <p>Your Arrow whistles through the air to strike the Urgaroh squarely between the eyes, and the force of the impact sends the creature somersaulting backwards to land in an untidy heap. You shoulder your Bow and unsheathe your Kai Weapon, and then you hurry across the platform towards the Urgaroh with the intention of dealing it a killing blow. The creature is howling in agony and writhing on the floor as it struggles to wrench the Arrow from its skull. As the shaft comes free, the Urgaroh emits a last, terrible shriek.

       <p>Lord Rimoah wishes you good luck as you step into the boarding cage in readiness to be winched up to the flying ship. Banedon is waiting on the stern deck to meet you and together you wave farewell to Rimoah as <cite>Cloud-dancer</cite> gets underway. Rapidly the monastery recedes from view as the ship ascends into the clouds and forges a course across the grey Durncrag Mountains. You retire with Banedon to his quarters where together you study his navigational charts. The Shezar Hills lie a thousand miles away on a southwesterly bearing, and Banedon anticipates your arrival there within twelve hours. During the voyage, Banedon recalls the year MS 5075 when he was abducted by Nadziranim sorcerers and imprisoned in the Darklord fortress of Kaag. Had it not been for Lone Wolf<ch.apos/>s brave and determined effort to save him, he would have surely perished there. Although anxious about Lone Wolf<ch.apos/>s abduction, Banedon is also grateful to have been given this chance to help you save his friend from a similar predicament. <quote>The task you<ch.apos/>ve undertaken will be difficult and dangerous,</quote> he says, <quote>but I beseech you, Grand Master, not to forswear your vow to save your master.</quote> Readily you reassure Banedon of your iron resolve to rescue Lone Wolf, no matter what difficulties lie ahead.</p>
       <p>It is shortly before dusk when <cite>Cloud-dancer</cite> approaches its destination. This is a shallow valley at the northwestern edge of the Shezar Hills, close to its border with the petrified forest of Helkona. You heed the lookout<ch.apos/>s cry and go up on deck to observe the sullen landscape from the port rail. Meanwhile, Banedon takes command of the ship<ch.apos/>s helm in readiness for a landing. As the craft descends, you survey the surrounding deadlands with trepidation. To the west, beyond the barren hilltops, a dull orangey light glows amidst the dust-choked clouds, proclaiming the hour of sunset. There is a strong sulphurous smell, and the distant hiss and rumble of active volcanoes lend further menace to this bleak, inhospitable landscape.</p>
       <p>Banedon brings <cite>Cloud-dancer</cite> gently to earth where it settles into the smooth, dusty soil. As his crewmen busy themselves securing its anchorage, he helps you to disembark.</p>
       <p><quote>Godspeed and good fortune, Grand Master,</quote> he says, as you get ready to descend to the ground by ladder. <quote>I shall await Lone Wolf<ch.apos/>s signal with optimism. Remember, when you have freed your master, he must speak to me telepathically. Only when I have received his mental command shall I approach Gazad Helkona. I will bring <cite>Cloud-dancer</cite> into the centre of the city-fortress and look for your signal. May Ishir protect you both.</quote></p>
       <p>You heed Banedon<ch.apos/>s words and bid him farewell before descending to the ground. Then, with a final wave, you turn and trek north across the barren valley floor. In the distance there is an undulating ridge of hills which lie between you and the petrified forest of Helkona. In order to reach your final destination, the fortress at the heart of this dead timberland, you must first traverse this range of hills. You stop for a few moments to observe the hills in the failing light and determine two places where you may be able to cross them. The first is a narrow gully that bisects the range, and the second is a winding, windswept trail that ascends to the peak.</p>

The perimeter around the base of Gazad Helkona has been cleared and levelled to provide an unobstructed field of fire for its defenders. To enter this area would have once brought a swift and certain death, but now the fortress garrison numbers but a fraction of the troops that used to patrol the battlements during the time of Darklord Chlanzor<ch.apos/>s rule, and you are quietly confident that you can cross this killing zone and reach the fallen tower without being seen.</p>

Here you crouch on a narrow ledge and peer into the dingy chamber that lies beyond the opening.</p>
       <p>Seated on a block of wood to the left of the aperture is an ape-faced creature with leathery, gnarled skin. It is scooping a grey, paste-like gruel from out of a stone bowl which it swallows after having sucked it noisily through its jagged fangs. You recognize that this creature is a Krorn, a cruel and ungainly breed of Agarashi that hails from the Hammerlands. While the Krorn is hungrily devouring its breakfast, you contemplate how you can gain entry to the chamber without the creature raising an alarm.</p>

       <p>You find yourself standing in a hall that is flanked on either side by a row of human skeletons. They stand at attention with their spines pressed against the stone wall, and clasped in their bony hands are rusty polearms of differing type and origin.</p>
       <p>At the far end of this torchlit chamber, you can see a pair of stout wooden doors reinforced with strips of polished steel. Cautiously you advance along the hall under the sightless gaze of the flanking skeletons, and upon reaching the doors you discover that they are secured by a combination lock. A single dial with a brass pointer is mounted upon a circular plate that is numbered 0 to 200 around its bevelled edge. You place the palm of your hand against the door, and a tingle of excitement runs down your spine when you sense that Lone Wolf is being held captive on the other side of these doors.</p>
       <p>With the help of your Kai Sixth Sense, you determine that the number which will open the combination lock is the same as the solution to the following puzzle.</p>
       <p>If A=1, B=2, C=3 (and so on through the alphabet until you reach Z=26), what is the total numerical value of the fortress of GAZAD HELKONA?</p>

       <p>You begin your search by lifting the lid of the wooden chest that rests beside the door. Your Sixth Sense tells you that it is unlocked and unguarded by traps, and inside you discover why: it is filled with dirty, threadbare clothing. A cursory search of these grimy garments reveals a Copper Key (if you wish to keep this key, record it on your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a> as a Backpack Item).</p>
       <p>Next, you examine the altar and the dark alcove that lies behind its shattered stone surface. Engraved into the curved wall of the alcove you discover several runes of unknown origin. You are tracing your finger around one of these ancient marks when suddenly you detect a secret panel.</p>

       <p>A bitter wind arises from the north as the gloom of dusk surrenders to darkness. It whips the sulphurous dust into whirling eddies that skitter across the valley floor and dance away into the distance. Determinedly you trek towards the hill trail with your head lowered and your cloak drawn close about you. Blasts of grit sting your face and hands and, as you struggle up the steep track towards the crest of the hill, you are forced to lean into the wind to keep from being blown over. As you slowly draw closer to the hill crest, you catch sight of a rocky knoll that promises some protection from this vicious dust storm.</p>

       <p>Patiently you wait until the avenue is clear; then you leave the tower archway and hurry across to the iron door. This heavy portal has no lock or latch, and when you push against it with the sole of your boot, it creaks open on its dry hinges.</p>
       <p>Inside you discover a large circular hall, dimly illuminated by a phosphorescent mould that encrusts the walls and high ceiling. The centre of the hall is dominated by a large pyramid of hard-packed cinder ash. Pairs of black iron rings are cemented into each face of the pyramid, and the skeletal remains of three humans hang from manacles attached to these rings. On the far side of the hall is a wide flight of iron steps that ascend to a dark portal. Standing on either side of this shadowy exit are columns of red-veined obsidian, engraved with glowing silver runes.</p>

       <p>The observatory platform is littered with chunks of rock and shattered glass. You peer over the parapet and, through the plume of grey smoke that is coiling up the shaft, you see that the lower landing no longer exists. Along with adjoining sections of the staircase, it has been transformed into a vast mound of rubble that lies heaped at the bottom of the shaft. The few enemy troops who have survived the explosion can no longer reach the observatory, but as you watch them attempting to recover the bodies of their fallen comrades, it crosses your mind that the explosion has also destroyed your only known exit from the roof.</p>
       <p>You retreat from the parapet and resume your attempt to revive Lone Wolf. At first the signs are not good; his breathing is shallow and his skin has a sickly pallor. But then you notice that his eyes are moving beneath their closed lids and you sense that he is emerging from coma.</p>

       <p>Beyond the door you can see the flagstoned approaches that lie within the main gate. Hammerland bandits draw pails of dirty grey water from a well by the south wall, and a patrol of sour-faced Drakkarim marches past them with their spears couched untidily on their shoulders.</p>
       <p>You scan the streets of this city-fortress and note that there are no individual dwellings here. The buildings of Gazad Helkona are grouped into four vast hexagonal blockhouse complexes, each topped by a cluster of minarets and spires. They are connected to one another by bridges that span the wide avenues between. At the centre of the stronghold is a massive octagonal citadel. A broad ramp leads to its portcullised gate which is guarded by fifty armoured sentries. As you observe the citadel, you sense a powerful concentration of evil lurking somewhere within its jet-black walls. Its highest level is dominated by a domed observatory which emits a pulsating crimson light. Your Sixth Sense tells you that Lone Wolf is being held captive somewhere within this edifice, and it hardens your resolve to rescue him.</p>

It is a sorcerous gem and it was placed here by Darklord Chlanzor<ch.apos/>s Nadziranim, his dark wizards, as a beacon to guide home his fearsome squadrons of Kraan.

Instinctively you look to the crystal sphere, and your heart sinks when you see that its swirling black vapours are now oozing through the glassy surface.

Then from the core of this whirlwind there issues a loud and hideous shriek that makes your blood run cold.</p>

       <p>You call upon your advanced Kai skill to order the malevolent dog to go away. Its growling quickly transforms into a pathetic whimper, and then its nerve breaks and it takes off along the street at a run.</p>
       <p>As it disappears from view, you climb the stairs to the first floor where you discover a wooden door banded with criss-crossing strips of enamelled iron. At its centre there is a polished black handle and a dial which is ringed with numbers. You examine the dial closely and determine that it controls a combination lock. By turning the dial to its correct numerical setting, you will cause the lock to disengage and the door will open.</p>
       <p>Using your Kai Sixth Sense, you discover that the correct setting is the same as the distance in miles that you travelled aboard the <cite>Cloud-dancer</cite>, from the Kai Monastery to the Shezar Hills, divided by the 50 miles that you travelled on foot from the Shezar Hills to Gazad Helkona.</p>

       <p>As soon as his ship is a safe distance beyond the walls of Gazad Helkona, Guildmaster Banedon hands control of the helm to his bo<ch.apos/>sun and then hurries down to the main deck to greet you and Lone Wolf. He praises you heartily for the success of the rescue, and Lone Wolf in turn thanks you sincerely for saving him from the clutches of Naar<ch.apos/>s fell disciples.</p>
       <p>A swift course is set for the Kai Monastery and the voyage is completed within ten hours. You spend most of the journey home sleeping off the fatigue of your ordeal, but you awake in time to join Lone Wolf at the prow as <cite>Cloud-dancer</cite> approaches the monastery shortly after dawn.</p>
       <p>Your arrival is greeted by a chorus of thunderous cheers from your fellow kinsmen. Every Kai who is present at the monastery rushes to the training park to celebrate the return of your leader. Banedon positions his craft above the park, and hawsers are dropped from stern and prow to anchor it in position. Then you join Lone Wolf in the boarding cage which is swiftly lowered to the ground.</p>
       <p>Lord Rimoah appears among the excited throng of young Kai Lords who are gathered around the cage. With tears of joy welling in his eyes, he embraces you both and then offers up a prayer of thanksgiving to the Goddess Ishir for your safe return. He voices his hope that Lone Wolf<ch.apos/>s abduction will serve as a poignant reminder to the Kai that they should be on their guard at all times, for Naar and his agents will always exploit an opportunity to damage or destroy your noble order.</p>

     <meta><title>Note on Standard Usage</title></meta>

     <data>
      <p>Quite a number of contributors to Project Aon have reported inconsistencies regarding the use of words such as Drakkar across the series. After much research into the usage of Drakkar/Drakkarim, Nadziran/Nadziranim, and Ligan/Liganim across the books, we have decided to standardise the usage of the words in the following ways, which represent majority usage:</p>
       <ul>
        <li>noun (s.): Drakkar</li>
        <li>noun (pl.): Drakkarim</li>
        <li>adj: Drakkarim</li>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       <li>noun (s.): Nadziran</li>
       <li>noun (pl.): Nadziranim</li>
       <li>adj: Nadziranim</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
      <li>noun (s.): Ligan</li>
      <li>noun (pl.): Liganim</li>
      <li>adj: Liganim</li>
     </ul>
     <p>All of the other words ending in -im either already conform to these rules (i.e. gazim, kuzim, lajakim, rekenarim, Sharnazim, and Tefarim) or cannot be conclusively tied to Darkland languages (e.g. Ghagrim).</p>
