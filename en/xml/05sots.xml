    <p>You are Lone Wolf<ch.emdash/>last of the Kai Lords of Sommerlund, and sole survivor of the massacre that destroyed them during a bitter war with your age-old enemies, the Darklords of Helgedad.</p>
    <p>It is midwinter in your northern homeland and a mantle of snow lies knee-deep in the streets of Holmgard<ch.emdash/>the capital<ch.emdash/>when you are summoned from your monastery in the hills by a messenger bearing a scroll, signed and sealed by the hand of King Ulnar. You are surprised to read the King<ch.apos/>s message, for it is a request for your help in solving an urgent problem of what he describes as <quote>great diplomatic importance</quote>. It seems a strange request to make of a warrior lord, whose skills are better suited to the field of battle than to parleying with foreign envoys. However, you obey the summons and upon your arrival at the capital, all is made clear.</p>
    <p>The Zakhan of Vassagonia, the imperial ruler of this desert empire, has sent his most trusted envoy to seek a treaty of peace between your two countries, and you have been asked to sign the treaty on behalf of your country. The reason for this is easily apparent.</p>
    <p>Less than a year ago, a renegade noble of Vassagonia called Barraka led his army of bandits in an attack upon the Sommlending province of Ruanon. This mining town and much of the surrounding land was overrun and destroyed. Many Sommlending lost their lives, and many more were enslaved and forced to labour in the mines of the Maaken Range. When the regular convoy from Ruanon failed to arrive at the capital, the king sent you to investigate. A great battle ensued in which you defeated Barraka in mortal combat. Without your courage and skill, the safety of Sommerlund and all of the Lastlands would have been placed in grave peril.</p>
    <p><quote>Your majesty, the Zakhan is gravely embarrassed by Barraka<ch.apos/>s foul treachery, and is most anxious that our friendship and trust be restored. He begs that you send the Kai warrior, Lone Wolf, to sign a treaty of peace with him at the Grand Palace in Barrakeesh,</quote> whimpers the Zakhan<ch.apos/>s emissary, as he kneels at the feet of King Ulnar.</p>
    <p>The king rises from his throne, barely able to conceal his distaste for the fawning envoy. He turns his gaze to you and bids you follow him to the privacy of an antechamber.</p>
    <p><quote>I have no liking for this desert realm, Lone Wolf, but I like the prospect of war even less. The Zakhan is old and frail, and has no son to claim his throne when he dies. Barraka was but one of many ruthless nobles who wait like jackals for the chance to seize power, and I fear they grow too impatient to allow the Zakhan to die a natural death. The treaty may not guarantee peace with Vassagonia once the Zakhan is dead, but it will at least buy us precious time to strengthen our southern border.</quote></p>
    <p>The king leads you to a window and points towards the harbour, barely visible through the falling snow. A Vassagonian galley lies anchored close to the harbour wall.</p>
    <p><quote>Go to Vassagonia, Lone Wolf. Sign the treaty and return quickly. Even with the promise of peace, I fear the shadow of war will fall upon us before the year is out.</quote></p>
    <p>You wave farewell to Holmgard on this bleak midwinter<ch.apos/>s day, feeling sure you will return before the thaw. But as you watch the spires of Holmgard disappear in the falling snow, you have no inkling of the shadow that awaits you in Vassagonia.</p>

    <p>You keep a record of your adventure on the <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
    <p>During your training as a Kai Lord you have developed fighting prowess<ch.emdash/><typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> and physical stamina<ch.emdash/><typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ>. Before you set off on your adventure you need to measure how effective your training has been. To do this take a pencil and, with your eyes closed, point with the blunt end of it onto the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a>. If you pick 0 it counts as zero.</p>
    <p>The first number that you pick from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> in this way represents your <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ>. Add 10 to the number you picked and write the total in the <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> section of your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a> (i.e. if your pencil fell on 4 in the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> you would write in a <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> of 14). When you fight, your <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> will be pitted against that of your enemy. A high score in this section is therefore very desirable.</p>
    <p>The second number that you pick from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> represents your powers of <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ>. Add 20 to this number and write the total in the <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> section of your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a> (i.e. if your pencil fell on the number 6 on the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> you would have 26 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points).</p>
    <p>If you are wounded in combat you will lose <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points. If at any time your <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points fall to zero or below, you are dead and the adventure is over. Lost <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points can be regained during the course of the adventure, but your number of <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points can never go above the number with which you start your adventure.</p>
    <p><strong>If you have successfully completed any of the previous adventures in the <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> series</strong>, you will already have your <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ>, <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points, and Kai Disciplines which you can now carry over with you to Book 5. You may also carry over any Weapons and Special Items that you held at the end of your last adventure, and these should be entered on your new <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>. (You are still limited to two Weapons and eight Backpack Items.)</p>
    <p>You may choose one bonus <a idref="discplnz">Kai Discipline</a> to add to your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a> for every <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> adventure you have successfully completed; now read the <a idref="equipmnt">section on equipment</a> for Book 5 carefully.</p>

      <p>Over the centuries, the Kai monks have mastered the skills of the warrior. These skills are known as the Kai Disciplines, and they are taught to all Kai Lords. You have learnt only five of the skills listed below. The choice of which five skills these are, is for you to make. As all of the Disciplines may be of use to you at some point on your perilous quest, pick your five with care. The correct use of a Discipline at the right time can save your life.</p>
      <p>When you have chosen your five Disciplines, enter them in the Kai Disciplines section of your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>.</p>

      <p>There will be occasions during your adventure when you have to fight an enemy. The enemy<ch.apos/>s <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> and <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points are given in the text. Lone Wolf<ch.apos/>s aim in the combat is to kill the enemy by reducing his <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points to zero while losing as few <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points as possible himself.</p>
      <p>At the start of a combat, enter Lone Wolf<ch.apos/>s and the enemy<ch.apos/>s <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points in the appropriate boxes on the Combat Record section of your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
      <p>The sequence for combat is as follows.</p>
      <ol class="paragraphed">
       <li><p>Add any extra points gained through your Kai Disciplines to your current <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> total.</p></li>
       <li>
        <p>Subtract the <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> of your enemy from this total. The result is your Combat Ratio. Enter it on the <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
        <p>Example</p>
        <p>Lone Wolf (<typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> 15) is ambushed by a Winged Devil (<typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> 20). He is not given the opportunity to evade combat, but must stand and fight as the creature swoops down on him. Lone Wolf has the Kai Discipline of Mindblast, to which the Winged Devil is not immune, so he adds 2 points to his <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ>, giving a total <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> of 17.</p>
        <p>He subtracts the Winged Devil<ch.apos/>s <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> from his own, giving a Combat Ratio of <ch.minus/>3. (17 <ch.minus/> 20 = <ch.minus/>3). <ch.minus/>3 is noted on the <a idref="action">Action Chart</a> as the Combat Ratio.</p>
       </li>
       <li><p><a id="stage3">When you have your Combat Ratio</a>, pick a number from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a>.</p></li>
       <li>
        <p>Turn to the <a idref="crtable">Combat Results Table</a>. Along the top of the chart are shown the Combat Ratio numbers. Find the number that is the same as your Combat Ratio and cross-reference it with the random number that you have picked (the random numbers appear on the side of the chart). You now have the number of <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points lost by both Lone Wolf and his enemy in this round of combat. (E represents points lost by the enemy; LW represents points lost by Lone Wolf.)</p>
        <p>Example</p>
        <p>The Combat Ratio between Lone Wolf and Winged Devil has been established as <ch.minus/>3. If the number taken from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> is a 6, then the result of the first round of combat is:</p>
        <ul>
         <li>Lone Wolf loses 3 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points</li>
         <li>Winged Devil loses 6 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points</li>
        </ul>
       </li>
       <li><p>On the <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>, mark the changes in <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points to the participants in the combat.</p></li>
       <li><p>Unless otherwise instructed, or unless you have an option to evade, the next round of combat now starts.</p></li>
       <li><p>Repeat the sequence from <a idref="stage3">Stage 3</a>.</p></li>
      </ol>
      <p>This process of combat continues until the <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points of either the enemy or Lone Wolf are reduced to zero or below, at which point that combatant is declared dead. If Lone Wolf is dead, the adventure is over. If the enemy is dead, Lone Wolf proceeds but with his <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points possibly reduced.</p>

Only Lone Wolf may lose <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points during that round, but then that is the risk of running away!

    <p>Your mission is one of peaceful diplomacy<ch.emdash/>but beware! The desert empire of Vassagonia is notorious for being a land of deceit and treachery. Be on your guard at all times. Also, make notes as you progress, as you will find they will be of great help in future adventures.</p>
    <p>Many things that you find will aid you during your adventure. Some Special Items will be of use in future <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> adventures and others may be red herrings of no real use at all, so be selective in what you decide to keep.</p>
    <p>If this is your first <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> adventure, choose your Kai Disciplines with care<ch.emdash/>a wise choice and a great deal of courage should enable anyone to complete both parts of this adventure, no matter how weak his or her initial <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> and <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points. Successful completion of previous <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> adventures, although an advantage, is not essential for the completion of this book.</p>

      <p>For twenty-five days, the Vassagonian galley sails on a steady course for its home port of Barrakeesh, with only a brief stop at the Durenese harbour of Port Bax to break a safe but monotonous voyage.</p>
      <p>You use your time aboard the ship to good purpose, learning the Vassagonian language from the ship<ch.apos/>s crew. They are only too eager to teach you, asking only in return tales of your adventures in the Lastlands<ch.emdash/>for many of the sailors, these are the most exciting stories they have ever heard. By the time you reach Barrakeesh, you have both mastered their language and won their respect.</p>

      <p>It is early afternoon when the ramparts of the desert capital are first sighted on the horizon. You push your way through the cheering crew, and join the envoy at the prow of the ship. Beaming with pride, he hands you a telescope and invites you to view the land of his birth. The sight is indeed breathtaking. You stare in fascination at the golden domes, minarets, and green-tiled roofs shimmering beneath the desert sun, and marvel at the splendour of the Grand Palace, which dominates this magnificent city. Then you notice that from every golden turret of the palace flutters a long, black pennant. You ask the envoy of the meaning of the black flags. Horror floods across his face as he snatches the telescope from your hands. <quote>By the spirit of the Majhan! He is dead<ch.ellips/>The Zakhan is dead!</quote></p>
      <p>As the bad news spreads through the ship, you pray that the peace treaty will be signed and honoured by the Zakhan<ch.apos/>s successor. However, the envoy is less than hopeful.</p>
      <p>The harbour of Barrakeesh is deserted save for a handful of citizens clad in black, and the only sound that greets you is the toll of a funeral bell, echoing through the harbour on this day of mourning. Then a horse-drawn carriage enters the harbour square, escorted by the cavalry of the Palace Guard. It halts, and a dour man in turquoise robes steps out to meet you.</p>
      <p><quote>A thousand greetings, Lone Wolf, I am Maouk, and I welcome you to our city on behalf of my master, his most sublime magnificence, Zakhan Kimah.</quote></p>
      <p>The envoy gasps upon hearing the name of the new Zakhan. He turns to speak, his eyes wild with fear. <quote>It is a trap, you must<ch.ellips/></quote></p>
      <p>His warning is cut short by the blade of Maouk<ch.apos/>s dagger. Suddenly, scores of black-clad warriors emerge from the shadows; they are Sharnazim, <ch.eacute/>lite Vassagonian bodyguards. They close in, surrounding you on every side. You must act quickly if you are to survive this deadly trap.</p>

      <p>Breathless from the exertion of combat, you step back as the Elix finally collapses and dies. Slowly, its glass-green eyes mist over and become opaque like hard, cold jadin. Around the creature<ch.apos/>s blood-spattered throat hangs a Gold Key on a chain. You quickly discover that the Gold Key opens the steel door of a strongroom at the far end of apothecary.</p>
      <p>High upon a shelf, just inside the door, you find a small box that contains what you seek<ch.emdash/>the Oede herb. Within seconds of pressing the beautiful golden leaves to your wounded shoulder, a tingling sensation engulfs your whole arm. The numbness soon fades, and both your arm and shoulder are free of the horrific Limbdeath microbes.</p>
      <p>Sufficient Oede herb remains in the box for one further application. It is a powerful substance that can be used against many deadly diseases or alternatively can be used to restore 10 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points if swallowed after combat. If you wish to keep the Oede herb, mark it on your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a> as a Backpack Item. You should also restore the <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> points that were temporarily lost due to Limbdeath.</p>
      <p>After dragging the dead Elix into the strongroom, you lock the steel door from the inside. You notice that there are in fact two doors to the strongroom: the one by which you entered and a smaller door set into the opposite wall. The Gold Key opens the lock of the new door, which leads to a narrow staircase beyond, dimly lit by flaring torches in wall brackets.</p>
      <p>The climb is steep and arduous. You suspect that these steps are part of a secret route to the strongroom, and your suspicions are only confirmed when you arrive at what appears to be a dead end. A closer examination reveals a narrow bronze door set flush to the wall, plain in appearance except for a tiny key hole close to the floor. As you insert and twist the Gold Key, you are quietly confident that the bronze door will open.</p>

      <p>The guard begins to cough. He pleads with you to slacken your grip or he will choke to death. You ask him one more question: does he know where your confiscated equipment is? He says he does not know. Then, suddenly, he elbows you in the chest and breaks free. You are winded, but you are determined to stop him from escaping.</p>

      <p>These geysers are common in Vassagonia. Much of the desert empire is unstable, but although it is subject to constant earth tremors, it rarely results in great destruction. The Vassagonians call these tremors: <foreign xml:lang="x-vassagonian"><quote>Tasa-Dophiem</quote></foreign>, which means <quote>The Wrestling Gods</quote>.</p>
      <p>This particular mud geyser has been put to practical use. It provides a constant source of heat for the dwellings built over the chamber. The steam from the <foreign xml:lang="x-vassagonian">tar-sorkh</foreign> rises into a pair of huge, circular chimneys in the domed ceiling, which in turn feed heat to the buildings above.

      <p>The door is unlocked, and for a moment your heart sinks; if this room is the Imperial Apothecary where the Oede herb is kept, why is the door not locked and guarded? Anxiously you slip inside and survey the interior.</p>
      <p>It seems to be an apothecary. Glass retorts bubble and steam over jets of blue flame, and strange fluids pass back and forth through a crazy maze of tubes and tunnels. Hundreds of herb jars line the far wall, and ten large copper urns, each full of rainbow-coloured powder, hang suspended from the soot-blackened ceiling. You begin searching through the herb jars, and suddenly you discover why the door was left unlocked. Creeping slowly towards you is the cat-like creature that guards the apothecary. Its eyes glow with a vivid green luminescence as it prepares to strike.</p>

      <p>You follow a straight passage of pale, rose-coloured stone, which soon ends at an empty vestibule. In its north wall is set a great wooden door, covered with engraved bronze plaques and studded with bronze nails. There is a curious lock set into the middle of this door, encircled by a beautiful carving of a long-tailed scorpion. A closer look at the lock reveals a series of Vassagonian numerals, numbered 1 to 200, engraved in the lock. You recognize the design: it is a Cloeasian combination lock.</p>

      <p>A sour-faced guard with a whip stands at the great doors to the kitchen. He delights in bullying the slaves that pass to and fro, lashing them with his whip and cursing them foully. You decide it is far too risky to confront the guard and instead focus your attention on the kitchen windows. The guard is too engrossed in beating an unfortunate slave who has dropped a basket of fruit to notice you sprint across the gardens and leap into the shadow of a tall, arched kitchen window. Then, to your horror, you notice that two guards are seated inside the kitchen, just below the window ledge on which you now stand. If they should so much as turn their heads, you will be seen.</p>

      <p>You hear a faint <onomatopoeia>click</onomatopoeia> followed by a soft whirring sound; the bronze door slides open. As you hurry through, the door clicks shut behind your back, as softly as it had opened.<footref id="sect67-1" idref="sect67-1-foot" /></p>
      <p>Instinct tells you that you have entered the chambers of the upper palace, the sumptuous private enclave of the Zakhan. You walk upon glistening tiles of opal and platinum, past sculptures and statues of pure gold. The door of solid amethyst ahead seems plain in comparison to the breathtaking splendour of this private world. Beyond the door lies another unique and startlingly beautiful world: the arboretum. A circular, cathedral-like arena spreads out below you, the green velvet canopy alive with the sound of bird song. Trees of every colour, shape, and size flourish in the deep, dark soil of the floor. The Zakhan<ch.apos/>s arboretum houses a specimen of every tree that grows in Magnamund, and many species that are now extinct elsewhere. As you walk the wrought iron balcony which encircles the arboretum, you recognize the leaves of a Sommlending oak. You feel a sudden wave of homesickness, but it does not make you despair; rather it renews your determination to escape from this hostile, sun-bleached land.</p>
      <p>At one of the exits from the arboretum, you discover a Quarterstaff propped against the wall. (If you wish to take this, remember to mark it on your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>.) The desire to escape urges you on as you leave the arboretum and hurry through a network of lavish corridors and empty, deserted vestibules. You reach a landing where a broad staircase descends to a massive room that occupies most of the lower palace.</p>
      <p>From the top of the staircase, hidden by the shadow of a pilaster, you stare down on a sight that freezes your blood with terror.</p>

      <p>A woman appears from the shadows of the counter. She has piercing green eyes and her red hair is raised, bound round with rings of jadin. <quote>Welcome, Northlander,</quote> she says, in a voice both soft and clear. <quote>How may I serve you?</quote></p>

      <p>You wake up in great discomfort; every muscle of your body feels knotted and bruised. You force open eyelids clogged with dried sweat, and look with dread at your wretched surroundings. You are lying on the hard stone floor of a prison cell. Over by the far wall, beneath a window criss-crossed with iron bars, is a low wooden bunk covered in filthy rags. Cockroaches, some the size of field mice, scuttle along a foul-smelling gutter that disappears into a grating in the floor. (Erase from your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a> all Weapons, Special Items, Gold Crowns, and your Backpack and all its contents, but note them down elsewhere in case you should find them again later.)</p>
      <p>You discover that your hands are free and slowly pull yourself upright into a sitting position, resting your back against the cell door. A faint draught from the corridor outside provides the only relief from the stifling heat and bad air of the cell. In the distance you can hear footsteps approaching. Then there is a jangle of keys and the creak of hinges. A door closes with a dull thud. More footsteps; they are getting louder. They come to halt outside the cell door and a loud voice bellows out: <quote>Sleeping on duty, Sefrou? You<ch.apos/>ll wake up on the other side of this door if the captain catches you!</quote></p>
      <p>The chair scrapes along the ground, and a startled voice, full of indignation, replies: <quote>Curse you, Hadj! The Zakhan doesn<ch.apos/>t want the Northlander taken to the Grand Hall until sunset. You<ch.apos/>ve cheated me of two hours sleep.</quote></p>
      <p><quote>Shut up, Sefrou,</quote> snarls the first voice, <quote>and listen hard. I<ch.apos/>ve just come from the armoury. Some interesting trinkets were found on the Northlander, worth a great deal of gold I<ch.apos/>d say. Seems a pity to let them go to waste, eh?</quote></p>

These are the free baths of Barrakeesh and the citizens of the capital are justly proud of them. They are the envy of the other desert cities where water is scarce and precious. The citizens treat the baths as a forum, a place for meeting and talking with friends. Much of the conversation you overhear is about the new Zakhan; few speak well of him.</p>

      <p>You dive into the putrid water, stealing yourself for the ghastly swim you have decided to make. The oily scum fills your nose and mouth and chokes in your throat. You claw your way across the vault to the opposite tunnel and struggle onto a narrow walkway. You are trembling, but it is not the shock of the swim that has made you shiver. Your arm will not function. Your shoulder, wounded when the trapdoor grille fell, stings painfully, and the whole arm below it is numb and useless. Horror engulfs you as you realize what is wrong.</p>

      <p>You drop to the floor of a corridor that heads off to the west. A wide staircase leads to a network of passages set with alcoves. Each alcove contains a bust or tapestry depicting past Zakhans and Vassagonian victories in long-forgotten wars.</p>

      <p>The poster is written from right to left in Vassagonian script. The time you spent learning the language aboard the galley was well spent, for you have little difficulty in translating the proclamation:</p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>His most illustrious majesty, Zakhan Moudalla the Exalted, has passed into the realm of the Majhan. May his spirit never die! By the grace of the Council of Kadi, the Funtal of Kara Kala, and the Judicar of Barrakeesh, it is decreed that Kimah, Emir of Ferufezan, Protector of the Dry Main, shall by right claim the throne of Vassagonia. Through the unity of the Seven Cities, he will lead his people to greatness.</p>
       <p>Long may he reign!</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>A scuffle breaks out at the end of the passage as a handful of Sharnazim try to push their way through the crowd. In the confusion a fruit stall is overturned, and its owner curses the clumsy soldiers at the top of his voice. Then there is a sudden silence<ch.emdash/>the luckless man has been beheaded for his insolence.</p>

Without warning, the blob suddenly jets towards you, propelled by water from its mass of breathing tubes. It is a Bloodlug, and it is hungry for your flesh!</p>

You cover your mouth with your Kai cloak, but the appalling stench makes you retch and choke. A loud splash behind you warns that Maouk<ch.apos/>s men are not far away, and you quicken your step. At regular intervals, circular chutes disappear into the ceiling. Many are stained bright yellow, white, or reddish-brown. This section of the <foreign xml:lang="x-vassagonian">Baga-darooz</foreign> passes beneath the Linen Quarter of Barrakeesh, where the Guild of Linen-weavers operate their fuller<ch.apos/>s shops.

Suddenly, a fearful scream bursts out of the darkness; Maouk has lost one of his men.

      <p>In spite of your injured arm, you successfully climb the nail-studded door and drop through the window into the silence of the trophy room. An eerie collection of stuffed heads lines the walls of this private chamber. Most are those of reptilian desert creatures, souvenirs of imperial hunting expeditions into the Dry Main. Among the snake-like trophies, and more gruesome, are human heads! They are ghoulish battle honours, the heads of enemy commanders slain in battle during the countless wars waged by Vassagonia.</p>
      <p>You hurry out of the <foreign xml:lang="x-vassagonian">Vizu-diar</foreign> and into a long marble corridor, where the walls are inlaid with veins of gold and pearls. It leads to a large hall where palace guards and brightly robed courtiers are walking to and fro, but a colonnade of statues provides all the cover you need to reach a distant staircase unseen. Stealthily, you sprint up the staircase to arrive at a junction where passages head off to the east and west. At the end of each is a door with a symbol engraved into the wall above. The symbol above the east door depicts a mortar and pestle; the symbol above the west door, an open book.</p>

      <p>Your desire to leave this treacherous city is overcome by your fear of losing your arm. You must get the Oede herb, even though it means you will have to enter the very place you are most anxious to avoid<ch.emdash/>the Grand Palace.</p>
      <p>The alley follows a tortuous route through the <foreign xml:lang="x-vassagonian">Mikarum</foreign>, finally leading you to the <foreign xml:lang="x-vassagonian"><quote>Horm-tas-Lallaim</quote></foreign>: the Tomb of the Princesses. Beyond the tomb, the Grand Palace rises like a massive white pantheon.</p>
      <p>You suddenly recall a legend told to you by your Kai masters long ago: <quote>The Nemesis of the Black Zakhan</quote>. The Black Zakhan was a brutal tyrant, the cruellest of an evil lineage that ruled over the desert empire long ago. The barbaric excesses of his reign have never been forgotten in the Lastlands. The Grand Palace was built by his army of slaves, prisoners from countries he had conquered in war. The palace became his obsession; he personally oversaw its entire construction and punished the workers personally if there was the slightest delay. He butchered his subjects indiscriminately and in the most terrible fashion. His favourite form of execution was for the victim to be sawn in half from head to foot until the body fell in two pieces. However, it was the mass execution of the slaves who built the Grand Palace that made him infamous. He slaughtered every slave worker so that his enemies could never learn of the secret treasure chambers he had had constructed. Among the slaves were his only daughters, Kebilla and Sousse, who openly opposed their father<ch.apos/>s cruelty and tried to prevent the executions. In a blind rage, he ordered that they should be the first to die.</p>
      <p>It would have been better for the Zakhan, and for Vassagonia, if he himself had died that day. He lived for another two years, but his mind was unhinged by guilt, and he was tortured by self-loathing and despair. In the Grand Palace, the silence of the night was frequently broken by the Zakhan<ch.apos/>s moans and cries, as he wandered from room to room looking for his daughters. When he died, he was laid beside them, here, in the Tomb of the Princesses.</p>
      <p>From where you stand, you can see two entrances to the Grand Palace; a spike-topped gate in the north wall, and an arch in the west wall, blocked by an iron portcullis. The palace is usually heavily guarded, but there are very few guards today; most are searching for you in the city.</p>

      <p>The warrior<ch.apos/>s head suddenly emerges from the sewer hole. He lashes at your legs, tearing a nasty gash in your calf. You lose 2 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points. In anger and pain, you raise your foot and stamp on the man<ch.apos/>s head with all your strength. He screams and falls back into the sewer, and you hear a loud, resounding splash. You replace the stone lid and drag a heavy barrel across it before making your way through the maze of city streets.</p>
      <p>All hope of signing a peace treaty with the new Zakhan has vanished; your only concern now is to escape from Barrakeesh and, somehow, return to Sommerlund as quickly as possible. Eventually you reach a busy market square. Your eye is caught by a sign hanging above the side entrance to large building:</p>
      <signpost>BARRAKEESH PUBLIC BATHS</signpost>
      <p>By this time, the smell of your clothes is making you feel quite ill. You have no hesitation in opening the door and slipping inside.</p>

      <p>As you stare out across the harbour, you notice a large, white-domed warehouse near to the water<ch.apos/>s edge. A platform on the upper floor overhangs a merchant dhow moored at the quay below. On this platform are several earthenware tuns: huge spice containers destined for the trading emporia of Ragadorn. You focus your attention on one of these tuns and concentrate all your Kai skill into making it move. Sweat pours down your face from the strain, but you soon hear a distant crash that confirms your success. The tun has fallen and shattered on the deck of the dhow.</p>

      <p>You recognize the creature; it is a Kwaraz, a giant, creeping reptile. Kwaraz are native to the Maakenmire swamp, hundreds of miles to the west of Vassagonia, but they thrive in any hot, damp, and fetid environment, and it strikes you that the <foreign xml:lang="x-vassagonian">Baga-darooz</foreign> sewer is an ideal breeding ground for these deadly beasts. The Kwaraz moves along the ceiling, gripping the stone with its long, curved claws<ch.emdash/>its oval eyes opening wider and wider.</p>
      <p>Kwaraz are very susceptible to psychic power. By using your Kai Discipline of Animal Kinship, you persuade it that you are not at all appetizing, and it soon loses interest. You watch with a mixture of fear and fascination as the huge reptile disappears along the tunnel. Suddenly, a fearful scream bursts out of the darkness; Maouk has lost one of his men. A shiver runs down your spine, but your instincts tell you to press on while you have the advantage.</p>

      <p>The dead courier<ch.apos/>s horse has bolted and fled, but your appearance at the gate on foot does not seem to arouse any suspicion. The guards inspect the scroll with bored indifference and allow you to pass through the gate into the palace gardens beyond.</p>

      <p>You have barely taken a dozen steps before you are seen. The giant armourer raises a massive hammer and strides forward, a bloodthirsty snarl escaping from between his clenched teeth.

      <p>Upon a raised platform, carpeted with scarlet fur, sits the Vassagonian Emperor, Zakhan Kimah. He is robed in gold but devoid of all ornamentation. In his hand is an orb of black metal, and in his eye an ice-cold cruelty that chills your spine. The Zakhan is a man of awesome countenance, but he pales in the shadow of his companion.</p>
      <p>Before him stands the cause of your terror. A helm as black as death itself hides the face, but the stench of decay and a hideous sepulchral voice betray the identity.</p>
      <p><quote>Give me Lone Wolf!</quote></p>
      <p>It is the fell voice of a mortal enemy<ch.emdash/>a Darklord of Helgedad. As the Zakhan rises to his feet, you notice a flicker of doubt, or perhaps of fear, dim his cruel gaze, but he is quick to mask it. <quote>He will be brought to you at sunset in exchange for the Orb of Death. It is agreed.</quote></p>
      <p><quote>You have the Orb,</quote> echoes the chilling voice. <quote>Give me Lone Wolf!</quote></p>
      <p>The Zakhan hides his fear well, but time is not on his side. The game of bluff he is playing is deadly. However, the fact that he has not yet been discovered is evidence of his powerful will, for you sense the Darklord is persistently clawing and probing at his mind.</p>
      <p><quote>You will get your Northlander, Lord Haakon,</quote> says the Zakhan, his voice curt with anger, <quote>when you tell me why your servants defile the Tomb of the Majhan. You claim to have no need for gold and jewels<ch.emdash/>why then do you plunder the graves of our ancestors?</quote></p>
      <p>A deathly quiet fills the hall; only the unnatural hiss of the Darklord<ch.apos/>s breath disturbs the silence. <quote>This land, this insignificant speck of sand, harbours two small thorns that prick our skin. We seek to remove them both<ch.emdash/>forever. The fledgling Kai, Lone Wolf, is the thorn that denies us Sommerlund. The Tomb of the Majhan hides the other thorn that threatens us<ch.emdash/>the accursed <cite>Book of the Magnakai</cite>.</quote></p>
      <p>Your heart pounds as the words echo in your head. The <cite>Book of the Magnakai</cite>! Suddenly, the reason why you have been enticed into a deadly trap becomes clear, and the sinister truth is revealed.</p>
      <p>The <cite>Book of the Magnakai</cite> is one of the oldest legends of Sommerlund. With the wisdom of the Magnakai, Sun Eagle, the first Kai Grand Master, instilled the disciplines into the warriors of the House of Ulnar, the bloodline of your king, that were to save your land from devastation at the hands of the Darklords. The <cite>Book of the Magnakai</cite> was lost hundreds of years ago, but its wisdom was kept alive, handed down through generations of Sommlending warriors so that they could share the strength to resist their eternal enemies, the Darklords of Helgedad.</p>
      <p>If the Darklords discover and destroy the <cite>Book of the Magnakai</cite>, the secrets will be lost forever, and when you die, the Kai will become extinct. However, if you discover the <cite>Book of the Magnakai</cite> first and deny the Darklords their prize, all the wisdom of the Magnakai will be revealed to you. Through its wisdom you will become strong, strong enough to reach the ultimate achievement for a Sommlending warrior<ch.emdash/>to become a Kai Grand Master.</p>
      <p>However, the peril and the glory of the quest that lies ahead are distracting you from more immediate danger. To discover this danger and to begin the quest for the <cite>Book of the Magnakai</cite>, turn to Part Two of <cite>Shadow on the Sand</cite>.</p>

      <p>There is no reply to your first knock. You are about to knock again when the door opens a few inches and the red-rimmed eyes of an old woman stare out from the darkness. <quote>Banedon!</quote> she exclaims, her voice hoarse and shaky. <quote>Thank the gods it is you.</quote></p>
      <p>She ushers you both inside and locks the door. The house is sparsely furnished, and what little is there is either damaged or broken. <quote>They have taken him, Banedon, they have taken my husband<ch.emdash/>the men with the faces of the dead. Ten days ago. They came like shadows in the night.</quote></p>
      <p>She breaks down, her frail body wracked by sobs. Banedon comforts her as best he can, but you sense he shares her bitter loss. The Drakkarim have taken Tipasa, of that there is little doubt. By now they will have made him tell everything he knows about the Tomb of the Majhan.</p>
      <p><quote>We will find him, I promise,</quote> says Banedon, wiping the tears from the old woman<ch.apos/>s face, <quote>but you must try to help us if you can. Tipasa always kept a diary of his travels<ch.emdash/>do you have it still?</quote></p>
      <p>A flicker of hope shines in the old woman<ch.apos/>s eyes. <quote>Yes, it is here. He told me to hide it when the evil men came for him.</quote></p>
      <p>She kneels at an empty fireplace and prises a loose brick from the chimney; a leather-bound book drops from its hiding place into her hand. She gives it to Banedon who studies the yellowed pages, his face lined in thought. You notice that the book is full of cryptic symbols, numbers, and pictograms.</p>
      <p><quote>They are drawn by the night stars,</quote> says Banedon, tracing his finger along the astronomical drawings. <quote>They hold the secret, I know, but without my star charts we cannot hope to find the tomb. We must return to the <cite>Skyrider</cite> at first light. There I shall be able to make some sense of this book.</quote></p>

      <p>Ahead of you, beyond a tree-lined colonnade, a flight of steps ascends to a small portal in the wall of the upper palace. To your right, a leafy tunnel winds away into the trees and shrubs.</p>

      <p>You begin to explore and eventually reach a place where a natural bridge of rock arches over a steaming course of water, red with ore. Huddled beneath the bridge is a pathetic figure, its body bent and emaciated. A tattered blanket covers his face, and in his withered hands he clutches a crude fishing rod. A small catch of lavacrabs lies on the bank, their claws twitching as they slowly die. As you move nearer, the figure raises his face to stare at you. It is a man, but the sight of his face shocks you to the core.</p>

      <p>As you turn and sprint along the passage, a terrible roar of hatred and rage fills the hall: <quote>Kill him!</quote></p>
      <p>You glance back. The Drakkarim are unsheathing their black swords, eager to obey their master<ch.apos/>s command. You race down some stairs, through a silver archway, and along a balcony that overlooks the lower palace.</p>
      <p>The Akataz is nearly upon you; you feel its fetid breath on your legs. Instinctively you dodge aside at the very second it leaps. It crashes muzzle first into a marble pillar. A howl of pain leaves its broken mouth as you step forward and strike a death-blow; it will never attack again.</p>
      <p>You glimpse the grim silhouette of Darklord Haakon in the hall below, his spiked fist raised. A Drakkar appears as if from nowhere and advances, a sword held high above his skull-like helm. There is a deafening crack as a bolt of blue lightning streaks from a stone in the Darklord<ch.apos/>s hand and comes hurtling towards you. The Drakkar lunges and wounds your arm (you lose 2 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points), but he now stands in the path of the bolt. In a flash of light, the Drakkar is gone, leaving only cinders and the rotten odour of scorched flesh behind.</p>

      <p>As night falls, your desperate quest begins. The Giaks pose few problems that you cannot overcome with your warrior skills, for they have been overworked to the point of exhaustion. Only the Drakkarim show any sign of vigilance, but even then, there are less than a dozen patrolling the entire crater. Not until you reach the main entrance to the Tomb do you encounter any real difficulty.</p>
      <p>A Drakkar stands on guard, his cruel eyes glinting behind his twisted iron death-mask. Occasionally, he diverts his attention from the watch to take a drink from a water flask.</p>

You lose 1 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> point. However, due to sheer strength of will, you manage to climb into the saddle and subdue the creature. It turns its head and fixes you with a cold black stare, but you sense that it is now no longer hostile.</p>

      <p>You learn that the dwarves were once the crew of a more conventional vessel, a merchantman that sailed the Tentarias of southern Magnamund. The Tentarias is a vast expanse of lakes and land-locked seas, which connect to form a continuous canal stretching nearly three thousand miles. They were created, as was the Rymerift of Durenor, by a massive landslide. Three years ago, the dwarves<ch.apos/> former captain, a dwarf named Quan, lost his ship, cargo, and crew whilst gambling at cards; it seems the unfortunate captain was unaware of Banedon<ch.apos/>s true profession until it was far too late. As a result, Banedon became the dwarves<ch.apos/> captain, and ever since they have adventured with him across the lands and skies of Southern Magnamund. The <cite>Skyrider</cite> itself was given to Banedon by the Magicians of Dessi, in return for his help in defeating the Gagadoth<ch.emdash/>a monstrous creature that terrorized their land, over which their own sorcery could not prevail.</p>
      <p>The <cite>Skyrider</cite> was travelling from Dessi on its way to Barrakeesh when you appeared. The dwarves have overheard your talk with Banedon and are excited by the prospects of a new adventure. They seem undaunted by the deadly dangers that it will certainly involve.</p>

      <p>Below the bell-tower you see a line of Itikar pens, each with its own circular landing platform. Itikar are a breed of huge black birds that nest in eyries high in the peaks of the Dahir and Vakar Mountains. The Vassagonians have long since tamed these giants of the skies, using them as winged mounts for their army leaders, their scouts, couriers, and envoys.</p>
      <p>An Itikar and rider swoop down out of the reddening sky and alight upon the platform nearest to the bell-tower. Slaves hurl a rope to the rider, who in turn fixes it to a saddle ring before he jumps to the ground. The Itikar caws and beats its huge wings as it is slowly winched into the pen by a hidden capstan.</p>
      <p>The rider and the slaves leave the platform; there is now only one sentry on guard at the pen. If you can overpower him, you can make your escape on the back of the giant bird.</p>

      <p>As you unsheathe the Sommerswerd, a vivid golden flame shoots along the blade. The Vordak shrieks in terror, its blood-drenched bony fingers clawing at a black iron mace that hangs from its belt. It raises the mace to parry your blow, but the sun-sword shears through the iron, a splash of blue flame erupting in its wake. You strike again, curving the golden blade in a great arc. It bites into the Vordak<ch.apos/>s neck, tearing through its unnatural body, and severing it diagonally from collarbone to hip. A sickening acidic smell chokes your throat as a fountain of green slime erupts from beneath the red robe. The Vordak crumples and topples from view, its dissolving corpse hissing as its spirals towards Lake Inrahim.</p>
      <p>Sheathing your sword, you grab the reins and fight to control your injured mount. You have slain the Vordak but the battle is not yet won. The Itikar is losing a lot of blood; it could become unconscious at any moment and drop like a stone.</p>

      <p>Dawn is breaking on the horizon of a low hill, blurred and dotted with small tufted trees. Swiftly the <cite>Skyrider</cite> has voyaged through the night to arrive at the foothills of the Koneshi Mountains, in whose folds the skyship is safely tucked away from watchful eyes. Twenty-five miles to the north, across a landscape of barren rock and dry brush, lies the Tomb of the Majhan.</p>

      <p>You and Banedon set off before the dawn, anxious not to waste either time or the protective cover of darkness. Now, as the great golden disc of the sun rises in the sky, for the first time you can see your goal. A massive excavation has exposed the heart of this scorched land, delving deep around the tombs of its forgotten ancestors. Thousands of Giaks, spiteful and malicious servants of the Darklords, labour unceasingly to remove rock and sand from this quarry, forced by Drakkarim to drag their backbreaking loads up ramps to the rim of the crater.</p>
      <p>Close to the edge of the crater, an encampment of black tents surrounds a large domed canopy. Lying in the shade of this construction is a huge flying creature<ch.emdash/>an Imperial Zlanbeast. Its presence here can only mean one thing: Darklord Haakon has arrived. The thought chills your blood, but you draw comfort from the labour of his slaves. That they continue to labour is a sign that their mission has yet to be completed: the <cite>Book of the Magnakai</cite> has yet to be found.</p>
      <p>It is impossible to approach the crater unseen; you will have to wait for darkness before you attempt to enter the Tomb. During the long wait, it is agreed that Banedon should attempt to find Tipasa. It is likely that he is being held captive inside the encampment<ch.emdash/>the Darklords would be unlikely to kill him before discovering the treasure they seek.</p>

      <p>The smoke clears to reveal the grinning face of a dwarf at the cabin window. A smear of soot blackens his rosy cheeks and exaggerates the whiteness of his crooked teeth. He is holding a tube of smoking steel that you assume to be a magic staff, until you notice that each of the dwarf crew carry identical staves. As they point them at the swooping Kraan, gouts of smoke and flame bellow from their tips. Suddenly you recognize the weapons and their wielders<ch.emdash/>they are dwarves from the mountain kingdom of Bor, armed with one of the inventions for which these ingenious artisans are justly famous throughout Magnamund.</p>
      <p>The Kraan are terrified by the noise; they turn their leathery tails and fly away, their Drakkarim riders powerless to stop them. The primitive guns have claimed only one victim, but nevertheless, they have driven off the enemy and saved the skyship from disaster.</p>

      <p>Leaving the arbour, you press on towards the outer wall of the arboretum. Through the dense foliage you can make out a narrow, arched doorway that leads to an open chamber. A stairway ascends to a parapeted walkway, at the end of which is a stone door. You are halfway up the stairs when the sound of a crossbow being cocked freezes your blood. To turn back now would be suicide; you grit your teeth and bound up the stairs as a hail of crossbow fire slams into the steps on either side of you.</p>

      <p>Without the breeze of the speeding <cite>Skyrider</cite> to cool you, the heat of the mountains is almost unbearable. You trudge across the loose reddish sand, your faces covered to keep the dust from choking your throats. All that seems to grow in this desolate waste is the wire-hard grass that tears at your boots and leggings.</p>
      <p>As you reach the outskirts of Ikaresh, you pass a small round hut where a goat is eating from a manger by the door. A man appears at the darkened doorway and bids you welcome; he touches his forehead in a salute of friendship and invites you both to enter his humble home.</p>

      <p>You are jerked backwards in the saddle as the Itikar leaves its perch. It shrieks and caws, its wings beating as loud as thunder. A handful of Drakkarim are scattered as if they were rag dolls as the great black bird emerges from the pen and takes to the sky. You catch a glimpse of a Drakkar, his death-mask slashed in two by the bird<ch.apos/>s razor-sharp talons, as he pitches from the landing platform and tumbles to his death in the palace gardens far below.</p>

You are near to crying out, when the pain ceases; you have not been detected. The finger sweeps away and the enemy continues its search along the path.</p>

      <p>Shortly after dawn the following day, you wake with a splitting headache. With bleary eyes you peer around you at the snoring dwarves who occupy the tiny bunks of the cramped cabin. The low hum of the ship only increases the pain that throbs like a demon inside your head, causing you to wince and grit your teeth at the slightest movement of your stiff and aching limbs. You lose 2 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points due to this monstrous hangover!</p>
      <p>Painfully, you gather up your equipment and climb on deck to find everything in deep shadow, for the <cite>Skyrider</cite> is hovering beneath a massive outcrop of sandstone that juts from the side of a mountain. Banedon still stands at the helm, but he is no longer in a trance.</p>
      <p><quote>Kraan-riders,</quote> he says, pointing to a sun-bleached valley beyond the shadows. <quote>They arrived with the dawn.</quote></p>
      <p>You stare out across an alien landscape, a mountain valley filled with thousands of pillars formed from massive and precariously balanced boulders. The pillars reach so high into the sky that an avalanche looks inevitable. The Vassagonians call this place the Koos<ch.emdash/><quote>the needles</quote>. Perched upon two of these huge rocky columns are Kraan, their Drakkarim riders scouring the valley with telescopes. An hour passes before they take to the sky and disappear.</p>
      <p><quote>Trim the boom-sails, Bo<ch.apos/>sun Nolrim,</quote> orders Banedon, his voice barely audible above the increasing hum of the <cite>Skyrider</cite>. <quote>We<ch.apos/>ve a fast run ahead.</quote></p>

      <p>As far as the eye can see, a long, straight, sandstone corridor slopes away into the distance. Torches crackle and sputter on the walls, illuminating the pictograms engraved in the yellow stone.</p>
      <p>At regular intervals, rough-edged slabs protrude into the main corridor. You stop to take a close look at one of these slabs and the floor beneath it and come to a frightening conclusion. They are obviously traps, no doubt set off by the Giaks when they cleared this corridor of sand. Rather than instructing the Giaks to avoid them, the Darklords must have deliberately used their slaves to set them off. Once the traps had been sprung, the squashed bodies were cleared away and the slabs chiselled through to the next section. Pit traps in the floors seem to have been neutralized in the same way. Set off by luckless Giaks, they would have been filled in with the dead bodies and levelled off with sand. The thought of this heartless barbarity fills you with revulsion.</p>
      <p>Just over a mile along the corridor, you eventually arrive at a large stone door. The stone surround bears evidence of chisel-work, but the door itself is rock solid.</p>

      <p>The Empire of Vassagonia is a vast desert realm. The northern coast runs roughly east for several hundred miles before it turns in a lazy, rugged arc to the south. Roughly at the apex of this arc is the city of Barrakeesh, the capital city of Vassagonia. The six other cities of this vast arid country are mainly to be found in the thin coastal strip, such as Ferufezan in the northwest, and Bisutan in the south. Barrakeesh is cut off from most of the rest of Vassagonia by the semicircle of the Kabar Range. These mountains meet the sea on the eastern coast at Cape Kabar, which overlooks a trio of islands. For all its magnificent coastline, Vassagonia lacks fresh water, with only six major oases in the entire realm, half of which line the trail to the south of the Dahir Mountains between Ikaresh and Bir Rabalou.</p>

     <meta><title>Note on Standard Usage</title></meta>

     <data>
      <p>Quite a number of contributors to Project Aon have reported inconsistencies regarding the use of words such as Drakkar across the series. After much research into the usage of Drakkar/Drakkarim, Nadziran/Nadziranim, and Ligan/Liganim across the books, we have decided to standardise the usage of the words in the following ways, which represent majority usage:</p>
       <ul>
        <li>noun (s.): Drakkar</li>
        <li>noun (pl.): Drakkarim</li>
        <li>adj: Drakkarim</li>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       <li>noun (s.): Nadziran</li>
       <li>noun (pl.): Nadziranim</li>
       <li>adj: Nadziranim</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
      <li>noun (s.): Ligan</li>
      <li>noun (pl.): Liganim</li>
      <li>adj: Liganim</li>
     </ul>
     <p>All of the other words ending in -im either already conform to these rules (i.e. gazim, kuzim, lajakim, rekenarim, Sharnazim, and Tefarim) or cannot be conclusively tied to Darkland languages (e.g. Ghagrim).</p>
