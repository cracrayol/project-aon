     <p>You are Grand Master Lone Wolf, the sole survivor of a massacre that wiped out the First Order of the Kai<ch.emdash/>the warrior <ch.eacute/>lite of Sommerlund.</p>

     <p>It is the year MS<ch.nbsp/>5080, thirty years since your brave kinsmen perished at the hands of the Darklords of Helgedad. These champions of evil, who were sent forth by Naar, the King of the Darkness, to destroy the fertile world of Magnamund, have themselves since been destroyed. You vowed to avenge the murder of the Kai and you kept your pledge, for it was you who brought about their downfall when alone you infiltrated their foul domain<ch.emdash/>the Darklands<ch.emdash/>and caused the destruction of their leader and the base of his power that was the infernal city of Helgedad.</p>

     <p>In the wake of their destruction, chaos befell the Darkland armies who had been poised to conquer all of Magnamund. This disorder escalated into a mutinous civil war, which allowed the Freeland armies of Magnamund time in which to recover and launch a counter-offensive. Against the odds, a swift and total victory was secured over the feuding Darkland armies.</p>

     <p>For ten unbroken years, peace has reigned in Sommerlund. Under your direction, the once-ruined Monastery of the Kai has been rebuilt and restored to its former glory, and the task of teaching a New Order of Kai warriors the skills and proud traditions of your ancestors is also well established. The new generation of Kai recruits, all of whom were born during the era of war against the Darklords, possess strong latent Kai skills and all show exceptional promise. These skills will be nurtured and honed to perfection during their time at the monastery so that they may teach and inspire future generations, thereby ensuring the continued security of your homeland in future years.</p>

     <p>Your attainment of the rank of Kai Grand Master brought with it great rewards. Some, such as the restoration of the Kai and the undying gratitude of your fellow Sommlending, could have been anticipated. Yet there have also been rewards which you could not possibly have foreseen. The discovery that within you lay the potential to develop Kai Disciplines beyond those of the Magnakai (which were thought to be the ultimate that a Kai Master could aspire to) was truly a revelation. Your discovery has inspired you to search for the wisdom and power that no Kai Lord before you has ever possessed. In the name of your creator, the God Kai, and for the greater glory of Sommerlund and the Goddess Ishir, you have vowed to reach the very pinnacle of Kai perfection<ch.emdash/>to attain all of the Grand Master Disciplines and become the first Kai Supreme Master.</p>

     <p>With diligence and determination you set about the restoration of the Kai Monastery and the training of the New Order recruits. Your efforts were soon rewarded and, within the space of two short years, the first raw recruits had graduated to become a cadre of gifted Kai Masters who, in turn, were able to commence the teaching of their skills to subsequent intakes of Kai novices. The Kai Masters rose readily to their newfound responsibilities, leaving you free to devote more of your time to the pursuit and perfection of the Grand Master Disciplines. During this period you also received expert tutelage in the ways of magic from two of your most trusted friends and advisors: Guildmaster Banedon, leader of the Brotherhood of the Crystal Star, and Lord Rimoah, speaker for the High Council of the Elder Magi.</p>

     <p>In the deepest subterranean level of the monastery, one hundred feet below the Tower of the Sun, you ordered the excavation and construction of a special vault. In this magnificent chamber wrought of granite and gold, you placed the seven Lorestones of Nyxator<ch.emdash/>gems of Kai power which you had recovered during your quest for Kai knowledge. In this vault, bathed in the golden light of those radiant gems, you spent countless hours in pursuit of perfection. Sometimes alone, sometimes in the company of your two able advisors<ch.emdash/>Banedon and Rimoah<ch.emdash/>you worked hard to develop your innate Grand Master Disciplines, and grasp the fundamental secrets of Brotherhood and Old Kingdom magic. During this time you noticed many remarkable changes taking place within your body: you became physically and mentally stronger, your five primary senses sharpened beyond all that you had experienced before, and, perhaps most remarkably, your body began to age at a much slower rate. Now for every five years that elapse you age but one year.</p>

     <p>In the years since your victory over the Darklords, peace has reigned victorious and the peoples of the Free Kingdoms have rejoiced in the knowledge that the evil which once threatened to destroy them has been banished from the face of Magnamund. Men have readily exchanged their swords for hoes and their shields for ploughs, and now the only marching they do is along the ruts of their freshly furrowed fields. Few are the watchful eyes that scan the distant horizon in fear of what may appear, although there are still some who maintain their vigilance, for the agents of the Dark God Naar come in many guises and there are those upon Magnamund who wait quietly in the shadows for the chance to do his evil bidding.</p>

     <p>Already your newfound skills have been tested against Naar<ch.apos/>s agents and you have, on each occasion, acquitted yourself admirably. Yet your continuing victories have enraged the Dark God and inflamed his lust for vengeance. Three years ago, you and your new Kai kinsmen achieved a glorious victory over a host of deadly Lavas. These dragon-like horrors were sent by Naar to destroy the Kai Monastery and lay waste to Sommerlund, and yet, despite their supernatural strength, they were defeated in battle by the sheer courage and skill of the New Order Kai who fought magnificently under your leadership.</p>

     <p>After the ignominious defeat of his minions, Naar retreated to the Plane of Darkness to plot and scheme anew. Victory at the monastery had won for you a respite in the Dark God<ch.apos/>s war against Sommerlund and the Kai. The following three years were peaceful for your homeland, yet elsewhere on Magnamund the agents of Naar continued their insidious work. On several occasions your special skills were sought by envoys from foreign realms whose leaders were desperate to rid themselves of Naar<ch.apos/>s minions. Courageously you undertook many of these dangerous missions and, by succeeding where no other mortal could, you brought fresh glories upon yourself and your fellow Kai.</p>

     <p>In the summer of MS<ch.nbsp/>5080, during a return voyage by sea from a successful quest to distant Dessi, an act of sabotage very nearly wrecked the sailing ship that was transporting you home. Only fair weather and skilful repairs by the Sommlending crew saved the ship from being lost in the Gulf of Durenor. When the damaged craft limped into its home port of Anskaven, more than two weeks late, the reception you received was far from welcoming. The normally cheerful seafaring folk of this busy port were in a strangely sullen mood. Clearly they all recognized you, yet none cheered as you disembarked on Anskaven quay. The crowd was quietly hostile. Before you could determine their reasons, the uneasy silence was shattered by a troop of heavily-armoured cavalrymen who came galloping along the quayside, their gleaming swords drawn. The crowd scattered as the horsemen drew up in a circle around you. Their leader, a nervous young lieutenant whose coat bore the black eagle and three hearts motif of Avan Caldar, Baron of Anskaven, curtly ordered you to lay down your weapons. Not wishing to provoke these city troopers, you obeyed the command and allowed them to escort you to Baron Caldar<ch.apos/>s castle where you felt sure their inglorious mistake would be swiftly punished.</p>

     <p>Baron Caldar formally received you in the Great Hall of his castle. You had met previously on many state occasions at King Ulnar<ch.apos/>s court in Holmgard and had always held each other in high esteem. Yet Caldar, flanked by more than a dozen armed bodyguards, could barely bring himself to conceal his contempt. He spoke to you as if you were a hated criminal. You asked why you were being treated in such a manner, but your pleas fell on deaf ears. Without further explanation, he ordered that you be taken immediately to the dungeons and placed in irons.</p>

     <p>Later that evening, using your mental Kai Disciplines to help loosen the tight-lipped resolve of a dungeon guard, you learned the reasons for your apparent fall from grace.</p>

     <p><quote>You first arrived in Anskaven by ship eighteen days ago, as expected,</quote> said the gaoler, in response to your psychic commands. <quote>Baron Caldar met you personally at the quayside and gave you a horse and six of his best troopers to escort you to Toran. During your ride to that city, they say you murdered his men and burnt their bodies. On arriving at Toran, you tried to assassinate Banedon<ch.emdash/>the Guildmaster of the Brotherhood of the Crystal Star. He survived, yet much of the Guildmaster<ch.apos/>s Hall was destroyed by your doing. To cover your escape from the city, you poisoned the wells causing hundreds of deaths. At first it was said that a Helghast had adopted your likeness to gain entry to the Guildhall, but Guildmaster Banedon refuted these claims. He is convinced that you are possessed by the spirit of Naar. The Guildmaster dispatched the Toran militia to spread this message across Sommerlund. A few days later at the forest village of Durnfallow, near Tyso, the Fryearl of Durnfallow was murdered and his manor house was torched to the ground. The villagers say they saw you riding away from the blazing ruins, howling like a crazed wolf. The people are terrified by the thought that Naar has corrupted you<ch.emdash/>their greatest hero<ch.emdash/>and turned you against your own. They are scared and they are demanding swift justice. King Ulnar has bowed to their will; he has sent all of his Border Rangers to Tyso with orders to find and kill you on sight.</quote></p>

     <p>The news of your alleged crimes comes as a bitter blow. You are sure that it is all the handiwork of an agent of Naar, and you resolve to find and vanquish this impostor at the first opportunity. However, as you cast your eyes around the damp walls of the castle dungeon, you can only pray to Ishir and Kai that the Baron and his guards will believe your story and allow you a chance to reclaim your honour.</p>

      <p>The Discipline bonuses mentioned do not affect your permanent scores. If you have completed previous adventures, the Disciplines that you have mastered may still be beneficial. See the Grand Master Rules section of the <a href="&link.rh;">Readers<ch.apos/> Handbook</a> for details.</p>

      <p>If you have completed any previous <cite>Lone Wolf Grand Master</cite> adventures, remember to choose an additional Grand Master Discipline and add +1 to your basic <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> and +2 to your basic <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> for each adventure you successfully completed (cf. <a idref="discplnz">Grand Master Disciplines</a>).</p>
     </footnote>
    </footnotes>

    <data>
     <p>You keep a record of your adventure on the <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
     <p>For more than ten years, ever since the demise of the Darklords of Helgedad, you have devoted yourself to developing further your fighting prowess<ch.emdash/><typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ><ch.emdash/>and physical stamina<ch.emdash/><typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ>. Before you begin this Grand Master adventure you need to measure how effective your training has been. To do this take a pencil and, with your eyes closed, point with the blunt end of it onto the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a>. If you pick a 0 it counts as zero.</p>
     <p>The first number that you pick from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> in this way represents your <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ>. Add 25 to the number you picked and write the total in the <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> section of your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a> (i.e. if your pencil fell on the number 6 in the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> you would write in a <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> of 31). When you fight, your <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> will be pitted against that of your enemy. A high score in this section is therefore very desirable.</p>
     <p>The second number that you pick from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> represents your powers of <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ>. Add 30 to this number and write the total in the <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> section of your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a> (i.e. if your pencil fell on the number 7 on the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> you would have 37 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points).</p>
     <p>If you are wounded in combat you will lose <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points. If at any time your <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points fall to zero or below, you are dead and the adventure is over. Lost <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points can be regained during the course of the adventure, but your number of <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points can never rise above the number you have when you start an adventure.</p>
     <p>If you have successfully completed any of the previous adventures in the <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> series (Books 1<ch.endash/>18), you can carry your current scores of <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> and <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points over to Book 19. These scores may include Weaponmastery, Curing, and Psi-surge bonuses obtained upon completion of <cite>Lone Wolf Kai</cite> (Books 1<ch.endash/>5) or <cite>Magnakai</cite> (Books 6<ch.endash/>12) adventures.<footref id="gamerulz-1" idref="gamerulz-1-foot"/> Only if you have completed these previous adventures will you benefit from the appropriate bonuses in the course of the <cite>Lone Wolf Grand Master</cite> series.<footref id="gamerulz-2" idref="gamerulz-2-foot"/> You may also carry over any Weapons and Backpack Items you had in your possession at the end of your last adventure, and these should be entered on your new Grand Master <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>. (You are still limited to two Weapons, but you may now carry up to ten Backpack Items.)</p>
     <p>However, only the following Special Items may be carried over from the <cite>Lone Wolf Kai</cite> (Books 1<ch.endash/>5) and <cite>Magnakai</cite> (Books 6<ch.endash/>12) series to the <cite>Lone Wolf Grand Master</cite> series (Books 13<ch.endash/>onwards):</p>

       <p>Weaponmastery bonuses are replaced by Grand Weaponmastery bonuses, not added cumulatively (cf. <a href="http://www.projectaon.org/en/ReadersHandbook/NewsletterExcerpts#lwcn28">Lone Wolf Club Newsletter 28</a>).</p>
       <p>If you have completed previous adventures, already possess the Magnakai Discipline of Weaponmastery with Bow, and have reached the rank of <bookref book="12tmod" section="imprvdsc">Mentora</bookref>, it seems that you should already be able to add 5 to numbers picked from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> (i.e. the basic Weaponmastery with Bow bonus of 3 added to the Mentora bonus of 2 for all missile weapons). Likely, the author intended the Weaponmastery bonus at the Mentora rank to be a <quote>hidden loyalty bonus</quote> (cf. <a href="http://www.projectaon.org/en/ReadersHandbook/NewsletterExcerpts#lwcn28">Lone Wolf Club Newsletter 28</a>). In view of this, the +2 Mentora bonus is therefore <em>not</em> cumulative with Grand Weaponmastery with Bow.</p>
       <p>Certain sections direct the reader to use different bonuses when using a Bow, ranging from 3 to 5, if you have Grand Weaponmastery with Bow. This may be the author adjusting the Grand Weaponmastery bonus on a case-by-case basis (and therefore this bonus should be used instead of the standard bonus) or an error (and therefore all of these bonuses should be 5). It is up to you to decide, but it seems most reasonable to follow the first alternative, to replace the Grand Weaponmastery bonus with whatever bonus is mentioned in that section.</p>

       <p>Now, through the pursuit of your new skills and the further development of your innate Kai abilities, you have set out upon a path of discovery that no other Kai Grand Master has ever attempted with success. Your determination to become the first Kai Supreme Master, by acquiring total proficiency in all twelve of the Grand Master Disciplines, is an awe-inspiring challenge. You will be venturing into the unknown, pushing back the boundaries of human limitation in the pursuit of greatness and the cause of Good. May the blessings of the Gods Kai and Ishir go with you as you begin your brave and noble quest.</p>
       <p>In the years following the demise of the Darklords you have reached the rank of Kai Grand Defender, which means that you have mastered <em>four</em> of the Grand Master Disciplines listed below. It is up to you to choose which four Disciplines these are. As all of the Grand Master Disciplines may be of use to you at some point during your adventure, pick your four skills with care. The correct use of a Grand Master Discipline at the right time could save your life.</p>
       <p>When you have chosen your four Disciplines, enter them in the Grand Master Disciplines section of your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>.</p>

        <p>This Discipline enables a Grand Master to become supremely efficient in the use of all weapons. When you enter combat with one of your Grand Weaponmastery weapons, you add 5 points to your <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ>. The rank of Kai Grand Defender, with which you begin the <cite>Lone Wolf Grand Master</cite> series, means you are supremely efficient in the use of <em>two</em> of the weapons listed below. For each book that you complete in the <cite>Lone Wolf Grand Master</cite> series (Books 13<ch.endash/>20), you will gain mastery of an additional weapon. For example, if you complete <cite>The Plague Lords of Ruel</cite> and have the Grand Master Discipline of Grand Weaponmastery at the beginning of the next <cite>Lone Wolf Grand Master</cite> book, you may choose an additional Weapon to gain mastery of.</p>

            <p>In order to use a Bow you must possess a Quiver and at least one Arrow. Each time the Bow is used, erase an Arrow from your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>. A Bow cannot, of course, be used if you exhaust your supply of Arrows, but the opportunity may arise during your adventure for you to replenish your stock of Arrows.</p>
           </dd>
          <dt>Backpack Items</dt>
           <dd>
            <p>These must be stored in your Backpack. Because space is limited, you may keep a maximum of ten articles, including Meals, in your Backpack at any one time. You may only carry one Backpack at a time. During your travels you will discover various useful items which you may decide to keep. You may exchange or discard them at any point when you are not involved in combat.</p>
            <p>Any item that may be of use, and which can be picked up on your adventure and entered on your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a> is given either initial capitals (e.g. Gold Dagger, Magic Pendant), or is clearly labelled as a Backpack Item. Unless you are told that it is a Special Item, carry it in your Backpack.</p>

          <dt>Special Items</dt>
           <dd>
            <p>Special Items are not carried in the Backpack. When you discover a Special Item, you will be told how or where to carry it. The maximum number of Special Items that can be carried on any adventure is twelve.</p>
           </dd>
          <dt>Food</dt>
           <dd><p>Food is carried in your Backpack. Each Meal counts as one item. You will need to eat regularly during your adventure. If you do not have any food when you are instructed to eat a Meal, you will lose 3 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points. If you have chosen the Discipline of Grand Huntmastery as one of your skills, you will not need to tick off a Meal when instructed to eat.</p></dd>
          <dt>Potion of Laumspur</dt>
           <dd><p>This is a healing potion that can restore 4 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points to your total when swallowed after combat. It cannot be used to increase <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points immediately prior to a combat. There is enough for one dose only. If you discover any other potion during the adventure, you will be informed of its effect. All potions are Backpack Items.</p></dd>

       <p>There will be occasions during your adventure when you have to fight an enemy. The enemy<ch.apos/>s <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> and <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points are given in the text. Lone Wolf<ch.apos/>s aim in the combat is to kill the enemy by reducing his <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points to zero while losing as few <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points as possible himself.</p>
       <p>At the start of a combat, enter Lone Wolf<ch.apos/>s and the enemy<ch.apos/>s <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points in the appropriate boxes on the Combat Record section of your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>. The sequence for combat is as follows:</p>
       <ol class="paragraphed">
        <li><p>Add any extra points gained through your Grand Master Disciplines and Special Items to your current <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> total.</p></li>
        <li>
         <p>Subtract the <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> of your enemy from this total. The result is your Combat Ratio. Enter it on the <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
         <p>Example</p>
         <p>Lone Wolf (<typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> 32) is attacked by a pack of Doomwolves (<typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> 30). He is taken by surprise and is not given the opportunity of evading their attack. Lone Wolf has the Grand Master Discipline of Kai-surge to which the Doomwolves are not immune, so Lone Wolf adds 8 points to his <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ>, giving him a total <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> of 40.</p>
         <p>He subtracts the Doomwolf pack<ch.apos/>s <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> from his own, giving a Combat Ratio of +10. (40<ch.minus></ch.minus>30 = +10). +10 is noted on the <a idref="action">Action Chart</a> as the Combat Ratio.</p>
        </li>
        <li><p><a id="stage3">When you have your Combat Ratio</a>, pick a number from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a>.</p></li>
        <li>
         <p>Turn to the <a idref="crtable">Combat Results Table</a>. Along the top of the chart are shown the Combat Ratio numbers. Find the number that is the same as your Combat Ratio and cross-reference it with the random number that you have picked (the random numbers appear on the side of the chart). You now have the number of <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points lost by both Lone Wolf and his enemy in this round of combat. (E represents points lost by the enemy; LW represents points lost by Lone Wolf.)</p>
         <p>Example</p>
         <p>The Combat Ratio between Lone Wolf and the Doomwolf Pack has been established as +10. If the number picked from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> is a 2, then the result of the first round of combat is:</p>
         <ul>
          <li>Lone Wolf loses 3 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points (plus an additional 1 point for using Kai-surge. This loss is in addition to the loss suffered as a result of combat).</li>
          <li>Doomwolf Pack loses 7 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points.</li>
         </ul>
        </li>
        <li><p>On the <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>, mark the changes in <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points to the participants in the combat.</p></li>
        <li><p>Unless otherwise instructed, or unless you have an option to evade, the next round of combat now starts.</p></li>
        <li><p>Repeat the sequence from <a idref="stage3">Stage 3</a>.</p></li>
       </ol>

       <p>This process of combat continues until the <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points of either the enemy or Lone Wolf are reduced to zero or below, at which point that combatant is declared dead. If Lone Wolf is dead, the adventure is over. If the enemy is dead, Lone Wolf proceeds but with his <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points possibly reduced.</p>

        <data>
         <p>During your adventure you may be given the chance to evade combat. If you have already engaged in a round of combat and decide to evade, calculate the combat for that round in the usual manner. All points lost by the enemy as a result of that round are ignored, and you make your escape. Only Lone Wolf may lose <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points during that round (but then that is the risk of running away!). You may evade only if the text of the particular section allows you to do so.</p>

          <dt>Animal Mastery</dt>
           <dd><p>Kai Grand Guardians with this Discipline are able to  summon a limited number of forest animals to their location.

          <dt>Assimilance</dt>
           <dd><p>Kai Grand Guardians who possess this skill are able to create a cloud of fog-like vapour within 15 yards of their location. This fog will obscure both normal and infravision. The duration of the fog increases as a Grand Master rises in rank.</p></dd>
          <dt>Grand Huntmastery</dt>
           <dd><p>Kai Grand Guardians with this skill enjoy increased mobility when travelling across all types of terrain, whether on foot or on horseback. This improved ability is very useful when used to outdistance a pursuing enemy.</p></dd>
          <dt>Kai-surge</dt>
           <dd><p>Kai Grand Guardians who possess mastery of this Discipline are able to attack up to three enemies in psychic combat simultaneously.</p></dd>
          <dt>Kai-screen</dt>
           <dd><p>Kai Grand Guardians who possess this Discipline are able to exercise a defensive psychic skill known as Mindblend. This cloaking ability enables them to both protect and hide their minds from being detected by a hostile psychic probe.</p></dd>

         <dl class="paragraphed">
          <dt>Grand Weaponmastery</dt>
           <dd><p>Sun Knights with this Discipline are able to wield two-handed weapons (i.e. Broadsword, Quarterstaff, and Spear) with full effect, using only one hand.</p></dd>
          <dt>Deliverance</dt>
           <dd><p>Sun Knights who possess this skill are able to repair serious wounds sustained by creatures other than themselves. By the laying of hands upon the affected creature<ch.apos/>s body, a Sun Knight can cause an open wound (or other serious injury) to mend itself. The speed at which this healing takes place increases as a Grand Master rises in rank.</p></dd>
          <dt>Grand Pathsmanship</dt>
           <dd><p>Kai Sun Knights with this skill are able to repel at will all normal-sized insects within a radius of three yards. The range and number of insects so affected increase considerably as a Grand Master rises in rank.</p></dd>
          <dt>Grand Nexus</dt>
           <dd><p>Sun Knights who possess Mastery of this Discipline are able to feign death. By placing themselves into a state of suspended animation, outwardly they are able to achieve all semblance of being truly dead. However, whilst in this state the only sense that a Sun Knight retains is the ability to hear.</p></dd>
          <dt>Telegnosis</dt>
           <dd><p>Sun Knights who possess this Discipline are able to communicate telepathically over great distances. Initially the range of this ability is approximately 100 miles, but this distance increases as a Grand Master rises in rank.</p></dd>
          <dt>Kai-alchemy</dt>
           <dd>
            <p>Grand Masters who have reached the rank of Sun Knight are able to use the following Brotherhood Spells:</p>
            <ul>
             <li><spell>Halt Missile</spell><ch.emdash/>This causes any projected or hurled missile (e.g. arrows, axes, crossbow bolts) which may  pose an immediate threat to the life of a Sun Knight, to cease its flight and remain stationary in mid-air. The effect of the spell lasts for 2<ch.endash/>3 seconds, allowing the Sun Knight sufficient time to move away from its line of flight. Initially only one missile can be affected by  this spell, but the number increases as a Grand Master rises in rank.</li>
             <li><spell>Strength</spell><ch.emdash/>By casting this spell, a Sun Knight is able to greatly increase his or her physical strength for a short duration. It can be used to lift or move heavy objects, or to effect a temporary increase in <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> and <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> scores whilst fighting an enemy.</li>

           <dd><p>Sun Lords with this Discipline are able to cause the metal edge of any non-magical weapon to ignite and burn fiercely. When a weapon thus affected is used in combat, it inflicts an additional 1 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> point loss upon an enemy in every successful round of combat. This ability cannot be used with a wholly wooden weapon such as a quarterstaff.</p></dd>
          <dt>Assimilance</dt>
           <dd><p>Sun Lords who possess this skill are able to cause the outline of their bodies to become blurred and indistinct. By so doing, they can greatly increase their chances of avoiding magical and/or non-magical missiles directed at them.</p></dd>
          <dt>Grand Huntmastery</dt>
           <dd><p>Kai Sun Lords with this skill are able to see, with acute accuracy, light in the infrared spectrum, i.e. they can see complex patterns generated by heat in near or total darkness. They can also see light in the ultraviolet spectrum.</p></dd>
          <dt>Kai-surge</dt>
           <dd><p>Sun Lords who possess mastery of this Discipline are able to launch a Kai-blast<ch.emdash/>a pulse of intense psychic energy which is capable of affecting both psychically active and inactive enemies. This form of psychic attack is very effective, more so than a usual Kai-surge, Psi-surge, or Mindblast. It can cause an enemy to lose between 2 and 18 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points in one attack. A Kai Sun Lord using Kai-blast determines the damage inflicted on an enemy by picking two numbers from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a>. These numbers should be added together (a <quote>0</quote> = 1) and the resultant total equals the damage inflicted. However, use of a Kai-blast will reduce a Sun Lord<ch.apos/>s <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points total by 4. It cannot be used in conjunction with any other form of psychic attack.</p></dd>
          <dt>Telegnosis</dt>
           <dd><p>Sun Lords who possess this Discipline are able to alter their body weight in order to walk successfully upon different kinds of surface, e.g. water, mud, lava, and quicksand. Time duration and degree of surface difficulty increase as a Grand Master rises in rank.</p></dd>

             <li><spell>Energy Grasp</spell><ch.emdash/>This spell enables a Sun Lord to discharge a powerful electrical force into anything he or she touches. It is similar in effect to the Brotherhood Spell <spell>Lightning Hand</spell>, but differs in that it is easier to control and channel the resulting energy. It also requires the actual touching of an object or an enemy to effect the spell.</li>

         <p>If you are a Grand Master who has reached the rank of Grand Crown, you will now benefit from improvements to the following Grand Master Disciplines:</p>
         <dl class="paragraphed">
          <dt>Grand Weaponmastery</dt>
           <dd><p>Kai Grand Crowns with this Discipline are consummate masters of unarmed combat. When fighting bare-handed, i.e. without any weapons, they may add 3 points to their <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ>.</p></dd>
          <dt>Animal Mastery</dt>
           <dd><p>Grand Crowns with this ability are able to plant in the mind of any animal the image of their most feared predator or adversary. Under the influence of this illusion the animal will believe, with all of its senses, that it is being confronted by such a creature instead of a Kai Grand Crown.</p></dd>
          <dt>Grand Pathsmanship</dt>
           <dd><p>Grand Crowns with this skill are able to create a clear passageway through dense undergrowth, forest, or jungle. Once having passed through this passageway, the plant material will revert to its normal state. This skill can also be employed by a Kai Grand Crown against magical foliage, or to counter any plant material ranged against him by an enemy.</p></dd>
          <dt>Kai-screen</dt>
           <dd><p>Grand Crowns who possess mastery of this Discipline are able to mask the goodly aura which radiates naturally from their minds and bodies. Additionally, Grand Crowns can deliberately alter these auras to give a false impression of themselves to creatures that are sensitive to such psychic auras.</p></dd>
          <dt>Grand Nexus</dt>
           <dd><p>Grand Crowns who possess this Discipline are able to speak a Kai Power Word<ch.emdash/>a holy utterance which will cause physical and psychic damage to any single creature within a radius of thirty feet. The degree of damage so caused, and the resultant drain upon a Grand Crown<ch.apos/>s reserves of <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ>, are dependent upon individual circumstances. The power and range of this skill increase as a Grand Master rises in rank.</p></dd>
          <dt>Kai-alchemy</dt>
           <dd><p>Grand Masters who have reached the rank of Grand Crown are able to use the following Brotherhood Spells:</p>
            <ul>
             <li><spell>Teleport</spell><ch.emdash/>By casting this spell, Kai Grand Crowns can transport themselves physically to any place which they can see with their own eyes. The spell will carry the caster, his equipment, and clothing to his chosen sighted destination. It cannot be used on any other living creature and it will not transport any other living creature along with the caster. Use of this spell will cost the caster between 1 and 5 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points every time it is used. This cost reduces as a Kai Grand Master increases in rank.</li>
             <li><spell>See Illusion</spell><ch.emdash/>Using this spell, a Kai Grand Crown is able to detect an illusion and know immediately its true identity or purpose.</li>
            </ul>

     <p>You are about to face an adversary who possesses skills and abilities commensurate with your own. Even though you have returned to Sommerlund, the land of your birth, you should remain wary and on guard at all times. Your enemy is cunning and ruthless; you can expect no quarter from him whatsoever.</p>
     <p>Some of the things you will encounter during your adventure will be of use to you in this and future <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> books, while others may be red herrings of no real value at all. If you discover items, be selective in what you choose to keep.</p>
     <p>Pick your Grand Master Disciplines with care for a wise choice will enable any player to complete the quest, no matter how weak their initial <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> and <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> scores may be. Successful completion of previous <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> adventures, although an advantage, is not essential for the completion of this Grand Master adventure.</p>
     <p>May the light of Kai and Ishir be your guide as you strive to defeat the agents of Naar.</p>
     <p>For Sommerlund and the Kai!</p>

      <p>The jangle of keys and the metallic squeal of a rusty iron bolt makes your pulse quicken. Moments later, the heavy dungeon door creaks open and two imperious figures step with caution into the dingy cell. They are protected by a dome of radiant magical energy, yet you can see enough of their features through this shimmering force field to recognize them to be Baron Caldar and Guildmaster Banedon.</p>
      <p><quote>Well met, old friend!</quote> you call out, but Banedon does not return your greeting. His countenance is one of fearful suspicion. Clearly he and the Baron suspect you are the evil impostor who has wrought havoc across Sommerlund.</p>
      <p><quote>Come now, Banedon. Truly, it is I<ch.emdash/>Lone Wolf. Won<ch.apos/>t you release me from these shackles?</quote></p>
      <p>Banedon takes hold of a crystal pendant that hangs from a chain around his neck and a wave of strong psychic energy washes over you. The sensation is deeply unpleasant, but you resist the urge to use your psychic Kai defences to repel it. Instead, you allow this mental probe to access the recesses of your mind and gradually Banedon<ch.apos/>s grim expression is replaced by a smile. He nods approvingly and, in an instant, the magical barrier which protects the two men blinks out of existence.</p>

      <p>Your killing blow decapitates the head of this mechanical beast, sending it bouncing across the chamber. Fountains of fiery sparks shoot from its severed neck and its torso cracks and crumples in on itself. Within seconds, the body is transformed into a glowing mound of steel slag.</p>
      <p>Warily you approach the creature<ch.apos/>s head and prod it with the tip of your weapon.

      <p>You throw yourself to the ground and the beam of blazing white light passes within inches of your head, close enough to scorch the hood of your cloak. The moment you hit the warehouse floor you roll over and over and scramble for the nearest cover<ch.emdash/>a heavy iron chest, banded and riveted with steel. The warrior follows your swift movement and looses a second beam from his spear which slams into the iron chest with stunning force. You gasp with horror as you see the side of the chest bulging towards your face. Its thick rivets tremble and its age-blackened skin smoulders with a sullen heat. Instinct takes over, making you roll away from the iron chest and seek cover elsewhere. As you move, the beam of light tears through the rear of the iron box and destroys the ground where, only moments before, your face had been.</p>
      <p>You call upon all of your camouflage skills to mask your body as you hurriedly seek a way to escape from this warrior and his sorcerous weapon. You reach the base of a large steel tank and scramble up a ladder fixed to its side. The top of the tank is stacked high with coiled ropes and you force yourself in amongst them. A few moments later you watch the warrior approach the smouldering remains of the iron chest. He is close enough now for you to see that his weapon is attached by a length of steel cable to a canister strapped to his back.</p>

      <p>Guided by a circle of blazing beacons, Javano the pilot lands the skyship expertly in the middle of a paved training park located within the castle<ch.apos/>s expansive grounds. In Tyso a curfew is in force, and the only figures lawfully abroad this night are Baron Medar<ch.apos/>s guardsmen whose numbers have been doubled by a regiment of Border Rangers recently arrived from Holmgard. Banedon suggests that you stay on board until he has informed Baron Medar of the true situation.</p>

      <p><quote>You will always be welcome here, Lone Wolf,</quote> he says clasping your hand in friendship. <quote>I knew in my heart that you were innocent of these crimes which have so shocked our people. You may rely on me to help you find this impostor who has sought to harm us and bring dishonour upon your good name.</quote></p>
      <p>You thank the Baron for his support and his pledge of loyalty, and you tell him how pleased you are to be in Tyso after the months you have spent abroad.</p>
      <p><quote>Then come, my lord, let<ch.apos/>s adjourn to my hall where you may enjoy the hospitality of my court,</quote> he says, and turns to leave the cabin.

      <p>Your killing blow punctures the beast<ch.apos/>s single lung and heart, sending it swiftly to the bottom of the flooded cellar. You sheathe your weapon and strike out for the surface where, upon clambering onto the steps, you pause for a few moments to regain your composure.

      <p>Eager to continue your pursuit, you climb the steps and emerge through a trapdoor into the rubble-heaped city ruins.

His tracks can be seen clearly embedded in the muddy floor of this tunnel.</p>
      <p>The tunnel passes under a street and then surfaces in front of a grand two-storey building, once a busy warehouse that stored braided coils of fine copper cable. You avoid the main entrance in case your adversary is lying in ambush there, and enter instead by way of a flight of iron steps that lead to a second floor window. The moment you set foot inside the building you sense that Wolf<ch.apos/>s Bane is here. Warily you explore, your nerves stretched to breaking point as your eyes seek out detail in the darkness. You are approaching the west wing of this building when you suddenly catch sight of your opponent through a hole in the floor. He is sitting on his haunches behind a mound of wooden crates, busily eating a green-skinned fruit, and he is unaware that you are watching him.</p>

      <p>To the left of the tunnel arch you discover two squares of opaque crimson gemstone separated by a small slot. The squares are similar in size and design to those you encountered at the entrance to the temple of Avaros. These, too, comprise a locking mechanism that controls this portal. By tapping upon each square a correct number of times you will cause the lock to disengage and the portal to rise.</p>
      <p>You place your fingers lightly upon the squares and feel the tell-tale vibrations that are the key to deciphering the secret code. After only seconds you are able to determine that the first code is equal to the number of islands south of the Kirlundin island of Hemd.</p>
      <p>The second code is equal to the number of villages that lie on the highway between the cities of Toran and Anskaven.</p>

      <p>Suddenly the Bangrol shrieks in agony as a steel-tipped arrow skewers its skull. The force of the impact sends it cartwheeling through the air to crash limply against the chamber wall. You glance to your left and see a grinning Blazer calmly shouldering his bow.</p>

      <p>Cautiously you approach the slain warriors. You are eager to examine their strange armour and you are particularly curious about the light-emitting spears they wielded; weapons such as these could prove useful in your fight against Wolf<ch.apos/>s Bane. However, on examining these steely shafts you discover that they are now useless. The source of their power was contained in the canisters strapped to the warriors<ch.apos/> backs, a power that is now depleted.</p>

      <p>When you prise open a helmet and breastplate, you discover a thin, pale-skinned humanoid within. His bone structure and muscularity is surprisingly weak for a warrior, prompting you to suspect that he must have relied heavily on his power-fed armour for strength and protection. This sallow-faced soldier has a lean and brutal appearance, a look which resembles that of an emaciated Drakkar.</p>
      <p>After having satisfied yourself that there is nothing worth salvaging from the bodies of these two slain enemies, you make a cursory check of your own equipment. You are hungry, and unless you possess the Discipline of Grand Huntmastery, you must now eat a Meal or lose 3 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points. Having satisfied your curiosity and your appetite, you hurry out of this derelict warehouse by a rear door and continue your hunt for Wolf<ch.apos/>s Bane<ch.apos/>s trail.</p>

      <p>The creature<ch.apos/>s sharp proboscis misses you by inches. Before it can strike again, you prise yourself out of the cluster and retreat back along the stamen until you are out of harm<ch.apos/>s way. Blindly the giant insect stabs and slashes, splintering stamen tips and drenching you with showers of sticky pollen. Fortunately, the span of its gigantic wings and the narrowness of the plant<ch.apos/>s corolla conspire to prevent it from reaching deeper into the plant, and you are able to escape without injury.</p>
      <p>You retreat all the way down to the bowl of the corolla, from where you began your ascent. Looking around you see that the hollow stem is now the only remaining chance you have of getting out of this plant alive.</p>

      <p>You approach the hut and crouch down beside its mud wall, close to its open door. Your senses detect no glyphs or other traps here, and there are no residues of magical energy that might betray the presence of illusions or shielding spells. However, your Kai senses do pick up a strong aura of Evil lingering at the rear of the hut, close to the water<ch.apos/>s edge.</p>
      <p>You move around to the rear of this hovel and discover that the bank is deeply undercut where the soft earth has been eroded by the fast-flowing stream. Standing in a line in the shadow of the undercut are a dozen wooden cages, each containing a fleshless skeleton. A shiver runs down your spine as your Magnakai Discipline of Divination detects the lingering agonies of these luckless victims. They suffered cruelly at the hands of the natives of this settlement before death finally ended their torment. The shock of your discovery is unnerving: lose 1 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> point.</p>
      <p>You leave the stream and return to the front of the hut. Inside the open doorway you discover several fruits stacked in mounds on a mat of woven rushes. Somewhat to your surprise, your senses tell you that they are nutritious and safe to eat. (There are sufficient fruits here for 3 Meals.)</p>
      <p>Wary of further delay, you approach the trench at the centre of the hut. Your tracking skills locate your enemy<ch.apos/>s tracks leading down the flight of steps, and quickly you follow them into an underground tunnel. You have gone only a few yards along this narrow passageway when suddenly you hear the terrifying roar of a large cat. With an abruptness that takes your breath away, a huge tiger-like beast comes bounding from out of the darkness ahead. So sudden and unexpected is this creature<ch.apos/>s attack, that you only just have enough time to unsheathe a hand weapon as it hurls itself upon you.</p>

      <p>Lying across the open doorway to the tomb is a slab of granite. Cautiously you move nearer to inspect a strange mark on its surface which is glinting in the light from your sword. You discover that it is an intricate design which has been scratched upon its surface. Someone has gone to the trouble of smearing it with dirt and a magical spell of shielding has been placed upon it to disguise its true purpose, yet you immediately realize what it is and you recoil from the slab, hurriedly retreating a dozen paces. It is a glyph of power: a magical booby trap that has been expertly camouflaged to keep it secret. If anyone or anything were to step upon or pass over this glyph, the energy contained within it would be released in one devastating instant.</p>

This huge chamber is partitioned into pens which house several giant dragonflies, similar to those you encountered when first you arrived on Avaros.

You scan the rain-swept pens for a sight of your adversary, and find him climbing upon the saddled back of a great crimson dragonfly. He urges the creature into the air and it obeys with stunning swiftness. You watch as Wolf<ch.apos/>s Bane steers his winged mount once around the roof of the hall, and then, to your horror, you see him bring the creature to hover directly over your head. He shouts at you, but his words are lost in the buzz of the dragonfly<ch.apos/>s massive wings. Then he leans from the saddle and casts down a metallic box before urging his mount skywards. The box lands close by, bouncing once before coming to rest near your feet. Your heart pounds when you sense that it is a powerful time bomb.

      <p>Nausea wells up from the pit of your stomach as the lower chamber of the tower is suddenly transformed into a whirling spiral of violent colours and noise. You feel yourself falling forwards into this vortex and, for a few fleeting seconds, you glimpse your adversary. He is brandishing his sword and laughing like a madman, his face twisted with maniacal glee as he rides this terrifying whirlwind. Then he is lost to the chaos of the maelstrom and he vanishes from your sight.</p>
      <p>For what seems like an eternity you spin and fall through a rainbow of colour and sound. Only gradually do you become aware that this nightmare journey is coming to an end when the noise abates and the swirling colours begin to fade. Then, with a jolt, you find yourself standing ankle-deep in stagnant green water, struggling to keep your balance. You draw your weapon and scan your surroundings, fearful of sudden attack, but you soon realize that you are alone.</p>
      <p>You appear to be under the ground, standing in a crude sewer-like tunnel which has been excavated by primitive means. The roots of trees protrude from its beaten earth ceiling and there is a stale and unpleasant smell of rotting vegetation. You use your psychic skills to probe for Wolf<ch.apos/>s Bane but you cannot detect his presence, and so you sheathe your weapon and relax your guard. The encounter with the manifestation of Naar has left a fear gnawing at your heart, the fear that the Dark God could at any moment he chooses lay claim to your soul. But your Kai courage swiftly overcomes the anxiety and you draw comfort from your faith in the Gods Kai and Ishir. You offer up a prayer to them to watch over you during the coming trial of strength, and vow that you will never lose hope, no matter what dangers you may yet face. As if in answer to your prayer you feel a surge of energy flow through your body, revitalizing your mind and senses (restore any <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points which you may have lost during your adventure so far).</p>

You trudge across this bleak and forbidding landscape, past sharp spires of crimson and jet that erupt through the dereliction to scratch the cloudy sky. Rust-red water encircles their bases, lending them a wholly sinister aspect. To your eyes it seems as if this blighted city has been impaled upon these cruel, towering spikes.</p>

      <p>As your enemy<ch.apos/>s platform passes through the next level of the tower, he leaps off and disappears from view. A few moments later, when your platform reaches this level, Wolf<ch.apos/>s Bane is nowhere to be seen. You step into the circular chamber and cast your eyes around its bare metallic surfaces. There is only one exit from here: a narrow tunnel in the north wall.</p>

      <p>Your blow has ripped a hole in the creature<ch.apos/>s silvery wing. The wound is not fatal, but the damage is enough to render the hungry creature incapable of ascending any higher. It emits a loud buzz of frustration which fades as it slowly spirals away towards a cluster of smaller dragonflies hovering near the centre of the gorge.</p>
      <p>Several minutes elapse before your tireless mount reaches the apex of the cavern and soars into the light-filled vent. Upon entering this vast aperture you are buffeted by crosswinds which sweep you and your air-steed precariously close to its rocky lip. The shock of the unexpectedly violent wind causes your mount to circle around the lip and attempt to dive back into the cavern. Blind with fear, it no longer responds to your commands, forcing you to take drastic action to avoid being carried back into the gorge. As you swoop past a rocky outcrop, you leap from the creature<ch.apos/>s back and abandon yourself to the crosswinds. Only your Kai Mastery and your lightning-swift reactions save you from being crushed to death as you are blown towards the jagged, volcanic rock.</p>
      <p>Miraculously, you survive the impact and are able to haul yourself out of the vent and climb safely onto a surface that you assume is the roof of the cavern. Seeking shelter from the raging crosswinds, you squeeze yourself into a hollow in the porous rock from where you are able to take stock of your new surroundings. The sight makes you gasp, for it is a view that truly rivals the fertile wonders of the cavern below.</p>

      <p>Black Hawk unsheathes his sword and rests this gleaming band of Sommlending steel across his forearm, awaiting your signal to proceed. You cast your eyes over the surface of the wall one last time, to satisfy yourself that you can detect no lurking traps, and when you are fully confident that it is safe you nod your head affirmatively. Because you are so sure that there is no threat, what occurs in the next instant is doubly shocking.</p>
      <p>Black Hawk puts the tip of his sword to the hairline crack in the wall and presses forward with all of his weight. But, unexpectedly, he meets with no resistance. His blade disappears into the wall and the young Kai Master stumbles forwards and vanishes through the seemingly solid granite. For a second or two there is a deathly silence. Then an explosion of white light obliterates your vision and you feel a searing wave of heat buffet your face and body.</p>

You stay hidden until the wagon comes to a halt and then you venture a glance over the side of its cargo bay to assess the situation.</p>
      <p>Before your eyes there stretches a cavernous plaza, crafted entirely of steel, glass, silver, and iron. Towering girders arc over your head, buttressed upon each other to support the many upper levels of this stupendous edifice. The plaza is vast and alien in design, and it is virtually deserted. You count no more than six armoured warriors, some so far distant that you have to magnify your vision to be sure that they are what they seem.</p>
      <p>The arrival of the wagon attracts no attention. The driverless craft has docked of its own accord at a steel jetty that encircles an iron support pillar. The coast is clear and so you waste no time in attempting to locate your adversary<ch.apos/>s trail. As expected, you find traces of his tracks close to the portal. They lead you to an archway which opens into a steel-lined chamber that has two exits: one to the left, the other to the right.

      <p>You have landed inside the corolla tube of some gigantic flower. Huge stamens rise up to the light from the sticky bowl-shaped floor on which you lie, and nearby there is a large, chute-like tunnel which drops away into the plant<ch.apos/>s hollow stem. For a moment you close your eyes and let your psychic senses explore this strange environment. Your greatest fear is that you have been drawn through the Shadow Gate to the Plane of Darkness, the supernatural realm of Dark God Naar, yet you can detect no abnormally high concentrations of Evil. Also, you are unable to sense the presence of your adversary<ch.emdash/>Wolf<ch.apos/>s Bane.

      <p>Ahead lies a chamber which is bedecked with a score of lavish tapestries, each depicting the landscapes of remote and wondrous planets within the universe of Aon. Your adversary<ch.apos/>s tracks pass through this opulent chamber and end at a pair of stout wooden doors, inlaid with exquisite gold marquetry. You place your ear to one of the doors and concentrate. The only sound you can hear is the crackle of a log fire, but your Kai senses detect the presence of your adversary in the room beyond. You peer through a keyhole and glimpse part of a gallery with a railed parapet. The wooden rails are lit from below by the warming yellow flicker of a fire.</p>

      <p>Using your advanced mastery, you are able to project the image of the creature<ch.apos/>s most feared adversary into its mind<ch.apos/>s eye. The huge serpent reacts violently; it twists and wrenches at its iron collar in a desperate attempt to break free from its bonds. Its great body, which is studded with tiny barbed horns, thrashes the water into a stinking foam as it writhes back and forth in front of the exit tunnel. Your psychic projection has this creature terrified, but its state of near-panic will now make it difficult for you to reach the tunnel and escape from this cavern.</p>

      <p>The moment you negate your spell of <spell>Levitation</spell> spell and set foot upon firm ground, you feel a warm breeze. You sense that it comes from a stairwell at the far end of this new hall and, when you investigate it, you rediscover Wolf<ch.apos/>s Bane<ch.apos/>s footprints on the stone steps. You cast your hands over them and detect that this is not a false trail: your enemy passed this way sometime within the last hour.</p>
      <p>Slowly you ascend the stairs and arrive at the arched entrance to a large, vaulted stone chamber. Gathered around a fountain set into its north wall are a group of six grey-skinned humanoids. They are busy drinking a clear, oily fluid that pours from the fountain<ch.apos/>s spout into a semicircular trough. All are barefoot and clad in rags, and they are each armed with a spear and a bow. The only exit from this chamber appears to be an archway set high in the north wall. There is a balcony in front of it that can only be reached by two flights of stairs which rise up on either side of the fountain.</p>
      <p>Quietly you observe the creatures slaking their thirsts, and you try to formulate a way in which you can get past them and reach the balconied exit in the north wall.</p>

      <p>You release your grip of your enemy and roll away from him. Moments later, the beam from his comrade<ch.apos/>s weapon hits his side and erupts through the back of his armour. The force of the impact lifts him bodily from the floor and hurls him into a pile of rusty cylinders, bringing them crashing down to bury him. Shocked and angry at having accidentally killed his confederate, the newly-arrived warrior rushes forward. He is determined to find and finish you once and for all, but his anger and his armour put him at a disadvantage. He fails to see where you have gone and, under cover of the smoke and debris, you manage to circle around behind him without being seen.</p>

      <p>You ask Steel Hand to give you his rope and he obeys dutifully. Then you utter the words of the Brotherhood Spell <spell>Levitation</spell> and almost immediately you feel gravity losing its grip on your body. Gently you rise to the ceiling of the vault where, using the exposed stone buttresses, you are able to pull yourself along until you are directly above the centre of the fissure. Here you fix one end of the rope to an exposed stone beam and cast the other end to your companions waiting below. One by one they swing across the void and, when all have crossed safely, you untie the rope and pull yourself to the far side before intoning the words that cancel the effects of the spell.</p>
      <p>It is clear from their wide-eyed expressions that they are all impressed with your mastery of Brotherhood magic, especially Steel Hand.

Your caution is rewarded when you hear footsteps at the rear of the building. You draw your weapon and enter, using the debris for cover as you inch your way towards the back of the ruined warehouse. You are moving between cover when suddenly you see the outline of a human form silhouetted against a broken window. Instantly you know that it is not Wolf<ch.apos/>s Bane: this figure is clad in grey, close-fitting armour and is holding a metallic spear.

The morbid fear of death that had gripped your heart quickly evaporates, but you are left with a feeling of deep unease as your senses detect that something extraordinary is taking place around you.

It is as if time itself is standing still.</p>
      <p>Wolf<ch.apos/>s Bane is a frozen statue, his face fixed in the malevolent sneer he was wearing in gleeful anticipation that you were about to meet your doom. You are beginning to think that perhaps you have been killed and that this is life after death, when suddenly you glimpse a blurred movement out of the corner of your eye.</p>
      <p>From the shadows cast by the gallery there steps a young teenage girl. She is dressed in a leather jerkin and threadbare trousers which are cut short at the knees. She is barefoot and appears to be armed only with a mischievous grin.</p>
      <p><quote>Who<ch.ellips/>who are you? Why are you here?</quote> you stammer, dumbly.

      <p>The grating rumble of heavy stone on stone heralds the sudden appearance of the impostor. Like some secret door to a nightmare realm, the entire far wall of this vault is slowly sliding open. Violent tremors shake the floor and orange tongues of flaming gas shoot from the ever-widening gap. Silhouetted in the centre of this fiery portal is a warrior clad in a parody of the robes of a Kai Grand Master. His stature and his facial features bear an uncanny resemblance to your own, yet the two of you are not entirely identical. The eyes of this impostor betray his true nature for they are black and cold; they are like two tiny windows through which you can see the evil lurking deep within his heart.</p>
      <p>The portal crackles and roars like a blazing furnace yet it radiates no heat. You sense powerful magic at work here and you shout a command to your young Kai comrades to prepare themselves for combat. They react as one, their years of training suppressing their fears, and swiftly they draw arms and form up in a protective circle around you. The impostor unsheathes his black-bladed sword and gives vent to a chilling laugh that momentarily drowns the roar of the flames. His cruel laughter fills your head and suddenly the stone walls of the vault seem to writhe and buckle inwards. Your psychic Kai defences resist this illusion and the distortion ceases, yet as it does so you realize that something important has changed. You command your companions to retreat towards the chute but they do not respond. They are completely rigid, frozen immobile like four stone statues.</p>

      <p><quote>And I intend to prove my worthiness, Lone Wolf,</quote> he adds, with quiet menace.</p>
      <p><quote>How so?</quote></p>
      <p><quote>By a duel,</quote> he replies. <quote>I challenge you to a duel. A fight to the finish. A fight between just you and I, Lone Wolf.</quote></p>
      <p><quote>And if I refuse your challenge?</quote> you retort, defiantly.</p>
      <p><quote>Then your four frail acolytes will die.</quote> The impostor sweeps his sword in a wide arc, as if to emphasize his threat, and the fiery wall at his back begins to change. The plumes of flame twist and spin with increasing speed until the wall is transformed into a swirling vortex. Fear tightens its icy fingers around your throat as you witness the creation of a Shadow Gate<ch.emdash/>a portal to another plane of existence. At once you know his threat is real. If he were to direct the power of the vortex towards your paralysed companions, they would be helpless to resist. They would be sucked into the Shadow Gate and destroyed.</p>
      <p><quote>Very well,</quote> you say, <quote>I accept your challenge.</quote></p>
      <p>Wolf<ch.apos/>s Bane gives a triumphant smile and whirls his black sword around his head. Then he dashes the blade to the floor and, in a terrifying instant, a mighty gust of wind tears the two of you off your feet and sends you both hurtling into the fiery heart of the dread Shadow Gate.</p>

      <p>You focus on Wolf<ch.apos/>s Bane as you intone the words of the Old Kingdom Spell <spell>Hold Enemy</spell>. You see him shudder, and the half-eaten fruit drops from his grasp.

There is an abrupt release of energy as the effects of your spell are negated and broken: lose 1 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> point.</p>
      <p>To your dismay, you watch Wolf<ch.apos/>s Bane leap to his feet and make a hasty escape.</p>

      <p>The reptilians complete the reloading of their bows, and together they lean over the lip of the pot to take aim at your unprotected body. Simultaneously they let fire, sending a stream of arrows whistling towards your chest, and you are forced to dive headlong into the grey slime to avoid being peppered with poison-tipped shafts. One of the bone arrows clips your calf and you feel an agonizing pain shoot up the back of your thigh as its poison enters your blood: lose 2 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points.</p>

      <p>The steel walls of the room you have entered are sheened with ice. Several tall glass canisters stand in a circle at the centre of this frigid chamber, connected to one another with pipes and coils of copper cable. Their liquid contents bubble and seethe and appear to be boiling despite the freezing air temperature. You walk around them, mesmerized by the strange beauty of the roiling multi-coloured fluids. Then you sense imminent danger somewhere to your right and instantly you spin around to face it, your hand reaching reflexively to the weapon at your belt.</p>
      <p>You see a dark stairwell and a shadowy shape which is crouched near to the bottom steps. It is Wolf<ch.apos/>s Bane. He is clutching a bow and he has an arrow drawn ready to fire. The instant you see him, he releases his bowstring and the tip of the arrow bursts into flames as it comes speeding towards your chest.</p>

      <p>You increase the rate of your ascent and swiftly accelerate beyond the reach of the predatory dragonfly. Unable to catch you, it emits a loud buzz of frustration which slowly fades as it spirals away. You glance down to see it satisfying its appetite in an attack upon a number of smaller dragonflies. From this great height they appear to be no larger than a cluster of colourful dots hovering above the centre of the great gorge.</p>
      <p>After several minutes you reach the apex of the cavern and soar into the light-filled vent. Upon entering this vast aperture you are buffeted by crosswinds which sweep you precariously towards its rocky lip, yet your Kai Mastery and your lightning-swift reactions save you from being crushed to death as you are blown onto its jagged, volcanic edge.</p>
      <p>You survive the impact and are able to haul yourself out of the vent and climb safely onto a surface that you assume to be the roof of the cavern. Seeking shelter from the raging crosswinds, you squeeze yourself into a hollow in the porous rock from where you are able to take stock of your new surroundings. The sight makes you gasp, for it is a view that truly rivals the fertile wonders of the cavern below.</p>

      <p>Caldar removes his hand from his sword and heaves a sigh of relief. <quote>Thank Ishir you<ch.apos/>ve returned to us, Grand Master. Perhaps now the evil that has befallen Sommerlund will be avenged.</quote></p>
      <p>The Baron summons his gaoler who unlocks the shackles that encase your wrists. Then, as the three of you hurriedly ascend from the castle dungeons to the Great Hall, Caldar and Banedon confirm the account of events that you extracted earlier from the gaoler. In addition to these facts you also learn that several days ago an angry mob, composed in the main of soldiers and citizens from Holmgard, marched upon the Kai Monastery. Firestone, the most senior of the New Order Kai, pleaded with the mob for calm. Fortunately they heeded his call and allowed him to send four Kai Masters to Tyso<ch.emdash/>the city where the impostor was last sighted. Firestone has ordered these four Kai to track down and slay the impostor as quickly as possible.</p>
      <p>You are in no doubt that this impostor is a formidable enemy, one who could easily prove more than a match for the four young Kai. Anxious for their safety, you request that you be allowed to ride to Tyso to join with them. Banedon is in agreement, but he suggests a swifter and surer way that you may reach Tyso. Moored to the tower of Baron Caldar<ch.apos/>s castle is <cite>Cloud-dancer</cite><ch.emdash/>the Guildmaster<ch.apos/>s skyship<ch.emdash/>which he places at your disposal. Gratefully you accept his generous offer.</p>

      <p>The shock wave from the blast sends you tumbling backwards into the chamber. Moments later something heavy falls across your legs, pinning you to the ground. You reach down to pull yourself free and discover that the object that is lying across your legs is Black Hawk. Dazed and trembling, you roll his limp body over and then hurriedly check to see if he is still breathing. Thankfully you discover that he is alive, although he has sustained serious injuries. His hand and sword arm are badly burnt and he is in a state of deep shock.</p>
      <p>Using your Magnakai Curing skills, you are able to stabilize his condition and bring him out of shock (in doing so you expend 3 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points). As you help him to his feet you look around and see that the others have been knocked flat by the blast. They too are now struggling to pull themselves to their feet. Fortunately their physical injuries are minor; their innate Kai skills appear to have spared them from serious injury. However, you sense that your inability to detect that the wall was an explosive illusion has taken its toll on their confidence.</p>
      <p><quote>Our prey is far more cunning than I feared,</quote> you say, ruefully, <quote>but we are Kai and we shall rise to the challenge. Our enemy possesses strong magic and he is capable of masking it well. Yet he chooses to use it to wound and weaken our party, not to kill us. Why this should be I do not know. But from now on we cannot entirely trust our senses to protect us. We must proceed with the utmost caution.</quote></p>
      <p>Beyond where the illusory north wall once stood, you can now see a small antechamber which is wreathed in acrid blue smoke. Gradually this smoke dissipates to reveal a shallow plinth upon which lies a bronze urn. This heavy object rests on its side and a quantity of pale grey ash has spilled from its hinged lid. Cautiously you approach the urn and see that there is an inscription engraved on its side. From this ancient script you learn that the ashes are the last remains of Baroness Garrulen, the wife of Hul<ch.emdash/>third Baron of Tyso. Glinting half-buried in the ash, you notice a ring encrusted with crimson gemstones. (If you wish to keep this Ruby Ring, record it on your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a> as a Special Item.)</p>
      <p>You are righting the urn on its plinth when you hear Steel Hand calling you. He has found something among the rubble which litters the floor at the rear of the antechamber.</p>

      <p>You are eager to confront your enemy, but you are wary of walking into a trap. At first glance he appears to be alone in this circular hall, but then you notice something curious about the hall itself. At the four points of the compass there are rails attached to the walls. Small horizontal platforms are attached to these rails and they move along them in a continuous procession. At the north and the south these platforms ascend through holes in the ceiling; at the west and east the platforms descend through similar holes and continue through other holes cut in the floor. You suspect them to be elevators and your suspicions are confirmed when suddenly an armoured warrior appears; he is standing on a descending platform and he passes through the hall and continues travelling downwards to a level somewhere below.</p>
      <p>Wolf<ch.apos/>s Bane is standing with his back to you and is examining a panel of glass set into the chamber wall. You magnify your vision and you see that the panel displays an illuminated view of the avenue that approaches the tower. Your adversary is watching and waiting for your approach; clearly he is unaware that you have already gained access to the tower.</p>
      <p>Suddenly, something alerts him to your presence and he spins on his heel, his dark eyes blazing with a mixture of fear and loathing. He sees you at the entrance to the hall and immediately he leaps upon a rising north platform in an attempt to escape from you. Determined not to let him get away again, you enter the hall and jump onto a rising south platform. As the platform passes through the ceiling of the hall, it carries you up a tall, open shaft. Wolf<ch.apos/>s Bane is on the far side of the shaft wall, some twenty feet above. You can see his face peering over the lip of the platform on which he is standing. He mouths something that you suspect is a curse, but then he points at you with an extended hand and a crackling arc of crimson fire leaps from his fingers and comes twisting down the shaft towards your face.</p>

      <p>You lower yourself carefully into the hollow stem and soon discover that it drops away very steeply. It is a vertical tube for most of its length, yet you are able to slow your rate of descent by grabbing hold of tiny tendrils which protrude from the lining of the stem wall. As you get nearer to its base, the stem wall becomes semi-transparent and slick with moisture. You press your face to this warm surface and you are able to discern other stems. They look like the trunks of trees in a dense green forest. Then you look down to see that the stem of this plant is descending into darkness. The darkness begins at the point where the stem passes below ground level. You decide to stop at this point for you have no desire to explore the roots of this strange flower.</p>
      <p>Carefully you examine the fabric of the semi-transparent stem. If you can force your way through this tough plant wall, you will be able to escape from your prison-like tube.</p>

A growing presentiment warns you that danger lies ahead and you pause to focus your Kai skills in an attempt to determine its exact nature. You cannot identify the threat, save that it is not a living entity.</p>
      <p>You draw your weapon and advance more cautiously now. As you turn a bend in this meandering passageway, a warrior appears from out of the gloom ahead. He is sheathed in plate armour and he clutches a sword and, at first sight, appears to be human. It is not until he steps a little closer that you see he has no neck: his visored helm hovers inches above his breastplate and is not connected to his torso.</p>

      <p>The fabled Moonstone was created many thousands of years ago by the god-like Shianti, whose presence upon Magnamund heralded the dawn of humanity. This wondrous artefact contains the combined might of all their magic and wisdom, the sum of all their knowledge. So significant was the creation of this artefact that all time on Magnamund is measured from the date of its creation. It had long been held that the Moonstone<ch.apos/>s location was a secret known only to the remnants of the Shianti, who dwell upon the Isle of Lorn in deepest Southern Magnamund, yet the evidence of your eyes tells you that this mystical stone of power has fallen into the hands of the Dark God.</p>

      <p>Suddenly the significance of the Moonstone becomes clear. Naar is using its legendary powers to generate Shadow Gates within the world of Magnamund, at locations and times of his own choosing. Such power has enabled him to send his loathsome champions to your home world, while the goodly forces of Kai and Ishir are held at bay, helpless to counter them. Only you and your Kai brethren have stood in the way of the onslaught of Naar<ch.apos/>s agents since the demise of his Darklords.</p>
      <p>The hideous form of the Dark God returns to the dais and settles there uneasily. Then a deep rumble fills the throne hall; it is the prelude to the voice of Naar.</p>
      <p><quote>You have done well, my champion,</quote> it booms. <quote>Now I command you to return to accursed Sommerlund and finish my work. Prepare the way for my armies of night. At last this planet is mine for the taking. My victory is complete!</quote></p>
      <p>It is clear from his words that Naar is convinced that you are his champion<ch.emdash/>Wolf<ch.apos/>s Bane<ch.emdash/>freshly returned from a duel in which Evil has triumphed. Suddenly you see Alyss emerge from the smoky wall less than a dozen paces behind Naar, yet the Dark God appears unaware of her presence. She appears calm and focused, and you sense that she is waiting for an auspicious moment to approach the plinth and take the Moonstone. With bated breath you watch as she inches closer and closer to the legendary stone. Then Naar shifts his gruesome bulk and she freezes.</p>
      <p><quote>You will not return to Sommerlund alone, Wolf<ch.apos/>s Bane. Kekataag the Avenger will accompany you. He has a mission of assassination to complete in Toran, at the Brotherhood of the Crystal Star.</quote></p>
      <p>Then the Dark God emits a high-pitched whistle and, moments later, a fearsome warrior answers the call. He emerges from the smoky wall and the floor shudders as he strides to the centre of the throne hall.</p>

In your growing despair, you call upon your divine mentor<ch.emdash/>the God Kai<ch.emdash/>for inspiration and, as if in answer to your prayer, you experience a sudden moment of revelation in which a bold plan takes form in your mind<ch.apos/>s eye.</p>
      <p>Using your innate Magnakai Discipline of Animal Control, you focus on one of the smaller dragonflies that is circling above the fecund blossoms lining the lip of the gorge. Instantly it responds to your silent command and comes soaring down to land in a nearby clearing. Like a tame and obedient horse, this winged creature waits patiently for you to clamber upon its back. Then, once you are in position, it takes to the air with such speed that your stomach feels as if it has been physically torn from your body. Several minutes pass before you fully recover from the shock of the stunningly swift take-off, and are able to sit back and enjoy the spectacular aerial views of the gorge.</p>
      <p>Using your palms and your knees, you quickly discover that you are able to steer the dragonfly towards the distant vent. Unfortunately, your ascent does not go entirely unnoticed. You are close to a mile above the canyon when suddenly your insectile steed attracts the unwanted attention of a larger predatory dragonfly. This predator is bigger and faster than your encumbered mount and, as it circles around him, it is clear that it is simply biding its time, awaiting the best moment to strike.</p>
      <p>You draw your weapon and tighten your grip on your mount<ch.apos/>s scaly back as the predatory dragonfly swoops down to make its initial attack.</p>

      <p>At the end of the passage you discover another tunnel that leads off to the left. The walls and ceiling of this adjacent passageway are dripping wet, indicating that it passes directly under the stream. You stride along its narrow confines, your shoulders grazing the muddy walls as you advance up a flight of steps which lead to an archway supported by thick wooden beams. Beyond the arch lies a large subterranean chamber that is daubed and decorated with runes and evil insignia. It is a primitive temple and it radiates an aura of Evil so vile and malicious that the thought of entering makes your skin crawl.</p>
      <p>On the far side of this unholy place, you see a stone altar standing before a huge boulder that has been crudely chiselled to resemble a grinning human skull. An eerie green glow pulsates from the eye sockets of this great skull-rock, and a mist swirls from its open jaw. Wolf<ch.apos/>s Bane stands before the altar, an arrogant sneer spreading slowly across his face.</p>

      <p>As you retreat a few paces from the shrieking horde to unsheathe a weapon, you glance towards the plinth to see how Alyss is faring. She has drawn upon her powers to create a cocoon of energy to protect both her vulnerable body and the legendary Moonstone. Kekataag assaults this glowing shield with maniacal ferocity, his great two-handed axe drawing fiery sparks with every mighty blow. You can sense from the hatred which blazes in his supernatural eyes that he and Alyss are old enemies.</p>
      <p>Her bravery inspires you to fight like a demon to reach the Shadow Gate and escape to your home world. You are determined that her efforts to save you will not be in vain.</p>

      <p>The great portal closes behind you with little noise, save the serpent-like hiss of escaping air. Inside, a cavernous plaza awaits you, crafted entirely of steel, glass, silver, and iron. Towering girders arc over your head, buttressed upon each other to support the many upper levels of this stupendous edifice.</p>
      <p>The plaza is vast and alien in design, and it is virtually deserted. You count no more than six armoured warriors, some so far distant that you have to magnify your vision to be sure that they are what they seem to be. Your arrival goes unchallenged and you waste no time in attempting to locate your adversary<ch.apos/>s trail. As expected, you find traces of his tracks close to the portal. They lead you to an archway which opens into a steel-lined chamber that has two exits: one to the left, the other to the right. Here the tracks become indistinct and you are unable to determine which way Wolf<ch.apos/>s Bane went from here.</p>

      <p>The damp subterranean tunnel meanders for nearly a mile before entering a cavern which is lit by rays of insipid sunlight, permeating through holes in its root-entangled ceiling. Your natural Pathsmanship warns you that the slimy water is deep at the centre of this cavern and, as you enter, you take extra care where you tread.</p>
      <p>Thirty yards opposite there is a sloping tunnel which appears to ascend towards the surface; dim light illuminates its dry earthen floor. You approach it, keeping near to the cavern wall to avoid the deep water, but you have only taken a few paces when a sudden noise jars your nerves. With a dull boom, a concealed portcullis falls from the ceiling to seal off the tunnel through which you have come. Moments later, swirling eddies form in the water at the centre of the cavern and, with a hissing splash, a huge snaky head breaks through the surface and rises up to scrape the ceiling. Around its banded neck there is a collar of iron which is attached to a heavy chain. The chain disappears below the surface, keeping the creature a prisoner of this cavern. You gasp as you look into the eyes of this gigantic serpent for they radiate waves of evil that seem to place a chill in your very soul.</p>

      <p>You step away from the bodies of your slain enemies and collapse against the wall of the vault, gasping for breath. As you slowly recover, you notice that one of the reptilians has a leather pouch slung around its neck. You kneel down and tear open the pouch to discover that it contains a small Iron Disc. A cursory search of his dead companion reveals a Dagger, a Sword, and a small stone phial containing a Black Potion (properties unknown).</p>
      <p>The size and shape of the disc suddenly trigger an image in your memory. You take the disc and insert it between the gemstone squares which operate the portal lock. There is an audible <onomatopoeia>click!</onomatopoeia> and the disc reappears at the slot. (If you wish to keep this Iron Disc, record it on your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a> as a Special Item.) Seconds later, the heavy portal begins to rise. You wait until it has risen a few feet and you are sure that no enemy awaits you on the other side; then you duck under the iron plate and hurry into the tunnel beyond. As you run, you hear the portal slamming shut behind you with a dull reverberating boom.</p>

      <p>The inside of the tomb is a cold and sombre place, devoid of all life. Its featureless walls glisten with rivulets of moisture and the air is dank and evil smelling, like the breath of some cold-blooded reptile. At its centre, where one would have expected to find the remains of the nobleman who long ago was incarcerated here, there is instead a yawning shaft. An ancient bronze ladder is fixed to the shaft wall which descends to an unknown depth.</p>
      <p>Using your Kai senses, you scan the tomb and detect lingering traces of the impostor. His trail leads directly to the ladder. After satisfying yourself that your quarry has left behind no unwelcome surprises, you step onto the ladder and begin a slow descent into the shaft.</p>
      <p>The ladder ends inside a larger stone chamber, one hundred feet below the tomb. Here you discover a granite coffin embellished with runes and ancient Sommlending script. As you wait for your Kai companions to complete their descent, you read enough of the script to learn that you have found the final resting place of Hul Garrulen, the third Baron of Tyso. Your senses confirm that you are on the trail of the impostor, yet there appear to be no other exits from this chamber, other than the shaft by which you entered.</p>

      <p>You step out from beneath the leaf under which you have been hiding and focus on the distant vent. Carefully you recite the words of the Brotherhood Spell <spell>Levitation</spell> that Guildmaster Banedon taught you many years ago, and moments later you feel yourself floating upwards through the air towards the apex of this gigantic cavern.</p>
      <p>The spell frees you from the grip of gravity and enables you to soar towards the cavern<ch.apos/>s roof. However, you are unable to control the angle of your ascent and in order to steer yourself towards the vent, you must try to position yourself in one of the thermal currents which are rising from the canyon floor.</p>
      <p>After some great effort you manage to locate a benign thermal which carries you slowly towards the distant vent. Unfortunately, you are not the only creature enjoying the hospitality of this rising current. You have soared close to a mile above the canyon when suddenly you attract the unwanted attention of a gigantic dragonfly. Anxious to defend yourself in case it should attack, you draw a weapon and wait with bated breath as it circles around your floating form.</p>

      <p>The once-grand doors of this hall no longer hang upon their hinges. They have been torn down and now lie twisted and rusted together, partially blocking the entrance. After checking to make sure that your adversary has not left any unwelcome surprises, you clamber over these ruined doors and begin a cautious exploration of the hall<ch.apos/>s gloomy interior.</p>
      <p>The cavernous ground floor was long ago gutted by fire. All that remains of its contents now lies buried beneath blackened timbers and twisted iron beams. Metal chains hang in festoons from the buckled roof girders, dripping icicles of rust. They sway and squeal eerily in the wind, sending shivers coursing down your spine.</p>
      <p>You detect nothing of interest in the debris and are about to abandon your search when suddenly you hear something unexpected<ch.emdash/>a dull <onomatopoeia>thump</onomatopoeia>.

      <p>Beyond the arch lies a steep ramp that descends to the floor of a circular chamber, the lowest level of the tower which soars into the stormy sky above. Runes of alien design run around the seamless glassy walls and the air is heavy with the sweet smell of decay. A large circular plinth stands in the centre of the chamber, its mirror-smooth surface a little under three feet from the floor. You take a step towards it and suddenly it is surrounded by a wall of fierce blue flames which shoot upwards from tiny vents in the floor around its base. As these flames gradually subside, you see four Kai Masters cowering upon the plinth. They are the four young Kai you thought had been left safely behind in the Old Necropolis of Tyso. They look petrified with fear, and when they see you they throw up their blistered, soot-blackened hands and plead for you to release them from their fiery prison.</p>
      <p>Drawing upon your Magnakai Discipline of Psi-screen, you detect that the image of the four Kai Masters is nothing but a cruel illusion. Then, in the very next instant, the ramp on which you are standing suddenly drops away from under your feet. You throw yourself to one side and crash down upon the floor of the chamber, rolling over as you strike the hard surface to lessen the shock of impact. As you stagger to your feet, you see the image of the four Kai being consumed by fire. It is a frightful sight, and as they scream their last, a wave of hostile psychic energy crashes into your mind.</p>

      <p>Dazed and trembling, you stagger to your feet and tentatively shake your head in an effort to clear your blurred vision. Close by your feet you see the outline of your weapon and you stoop to retrieve it. (If you were holding a normal weapon when you passed through the wall, you discover it has been destroyed by the blast: delete this weapon from your <a idref="action">Weapons List</a>. If the weapon you were holding was a Special Item, you discover that it has survived intact.)</p>
      <p>As your vision returns you see that you have been hurled back into the chamber. Your fellow Kai, all of whom were knocked to the floor by the blast, are now struggling to get themselves back on their feet. Fortunately their physical injuries are minor; their innate Kai skills have spared them from serious injury. However, you sense that your inability to detect that the wall was an explosive illusion has severely shaken their confidence.</p>
      <p><quote>Our prey is far more cunning than I feared,</quote> you say, ruefully, <quote>but we are Kai and we shall rise to the challenge. Our enemy possesses strong magic and he is capable of masking it well. Yet he chooses to use it to wound and weaken our party, not to kill us. Why this should be I do not know. But from now on we cannot entirely trust our senses to protect us. We must proceed with the utmost caution.</quote></p>
      <p>Beyond where the illusory north wall once stood, you can now see a small antechamber which is wreathed in acrid blue smoke. Gradually this smoke dissipates to reveal a shallow plinth upon which lies a bronze urn. This heavy object rests on its side and a quantity of pale grey ash has spilled from its hinged lid. Cautiously you approach the urn and see that there is an inscription engraved on its side. From this ancient script you learn that the ashes are the last remains of Baroness Garrulen, the wife of Hul<ch.emdash/>third Baron of Tyso. Glinting half-buried in the ash, you notice a ring encrusted with crimson gemstones. (If you wish to keep this Ruby Ring, record it on your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a> as a Special Item.)</p>
      <p>You are righting the urn on its plinth when you hear Steel Hand calling you. He has found something among the rubble which litters the floor at the rear of the antechamber.</p>

      <p>For what seems like an eternity, you plummet into the swirling heart of a supernatural vortex. Brilliant sparks and flashes of colour illuminate this funnel of darkness as items of furniture from the banquet hall explode and disintegrate, unable to withstand the extraordinary pressures generated by this cosmic whirlpool. You watch with shock and awe as the lifeless body of your adversary<ch.emdash/>Wolf<ch.apos/>s Bane<ch.emdash/>is transformed into a fiery meteor before your very eyes. Then, gradually, the spin of the vortex becomes less fierce and you feel the centripetal pull on your body easing. Beams of light penetrate the darkness and you see Alyss glide into view. She appears to be reclining, as if casually resting upon a couch after a weary day<ch.apos/>s work, and her expression is mildly pensive. She looks as if to her this whole terrifying journey is nothing more than an irritating inconvenience.</p>
      <p>At last the vortex slows to a standstill and you feel ground solidifying beneath your feet. But the darkness gives way to a swirling mist which dissolves to reveal a horrifying sight. A deep and morbid terror returns to twist its knife in your guts when you suddenly realize where you are. You have been summoned to the throne hall of Naar<ch.emdash/>the seat of power of the King of the Darkness<ch.emdash/>the inner sanctum of ultimate Evil.</p>

      <p>You muster your skill and plunge your hand into the water, close to where the creature<ch.apos/>s head has surfaced. In an instant, the black water around its neck and body freezes over, trapping and crushing the beast within a solid block of ice.</p>
      <p>Free now to continue your pursuit, you leave the frozen cellar-beast and climb the steps to emerge amongst the ruins of the city. There is no sign of Wolf<ch.apos/>s Bane, but when you hurry to where you saw him last, you discover a flight of steps leading down into a wide underground passage. His tracks can be seen clearly embedded in the muddy floor of this tunnel.</p>
      <p>The tunnel passes under a broad avenue and then surfaces in front of a grand two-storey building. This was once a busy warehouse that stored braided coils of fine copper cable. You avoid the main entrance in case your adversary is lying in ambush there, and enter instead by way of a flight of iron steps that leads to a second floor window. The moment you set foot inside the building you sense that Wolf<ch.apos/>s Bane is here. Warily you explore, your nerves stretched to breaking point as your eyes seek out detail in the darkness. You are approaching the west wing of this building when you suddenly catch sight of your opponent through a hole in the floor. He is sitting on his haunches behind a mound of wooden crates, busily eating a green-skinned fruit, and he is unaware that you are watching him.</p>

      <p>Cautiously you inch your way nearer to the open tomb. Lying across the threshold is a slab of stone which stirs your curiosity. A closer inspection reveals an intricate design scratched upon its surface. It has been smeared with dirt and a magical spell of shielding has been placed upon it to disguise its true purpose. Yet you realize immediately what it is and you recoil from the slab, hurriedly retreating a dozen paces. It is a glyph of power: a magical booby trap that has been expertly camouflaged to keep it secret. If anyone or anything were to step upon or pass over this glyph, the energy contained within it would be released in one devastating instant.</p>

      <p>The moment you enter the mouth of the skull-rock you are engulfed by a dense fog that is icy cold and impenetrable to your sight and senses. The thunderous noise of the temple<ch.apos/>s destruction ends abruptly, as if a great door has suddenly been closed upon it. You strain your Kai skills to aid your pursuit of Wolf<ch.apos/>s Bane but to no avail; the ivory-white fog hides everything, swamping and distorting your sense of time and direction.</p>
      <p>You keep moving, forcing yourself onwards, even though the surface beneath your feet has become viscous and uncertain. After what seems like an eternity spent wandering through this cloudy limbo, you gradually feel the ground hardening and sense that the impenetrable fog is beginning to dissipate. Patches of grey appear in the creamy whiteness. Then the fog dissolves completely and you find yourself standing in the middle of a rubble-strewn street, surrounded by the bleak and derelict remains of a decaying, alien city.</p>
      <p>It is the dead of night and a fine drizzle falls from a storm-laden sky, dampening this dreary landscape. Everywhere you look you see the hollow shells of buildings. They are heaped with mounds of broken stone, twisted rusty iron, and shattered glass. There are no trees, no blades of grass, no animals here. Everything is cold, grey, and dead.</p>
      <p>You examine the paved surface of the street and detect your enemy<ch.apos/>s footprints. They are fresh and they lead you to a small courtyard flanked by two buildings: a large municipal hall and a smaller two-storey dwelling. Wolf<ch.apos/>s Bane<ch.apos/>s tracks end in the middle of the wet courtyard and you sense that they have been deliberately erased.

      <p>The sudden shock of impact nearly knocks you off the back of your flying steed. Frantically you scramble to regain your seat and, as you pull yourself upright, you notice that the enemy is now more than a hundred feet below; the momentum of its attack has carried it deeper into the cavern.</p>
      <p>Your mount seizes its slim advantage and climbs as fast as it can to get away from the larger dragonfly. The enemy circles about, as if preparing to pursue; then it emits a loud buzz and changes its course. You watch with relief as it spirals away towards a cluster of smaller dragonflies that are hovering near the centre of the gorge.</p>
      <p>Several minutes elapse before your tireless mount reaches the apex of the cavern and soars into the light-filled vent. Upon entering this vast aperture you are buffeted by crosswinds which sweep you and your air-steed precariously close to its rocky lip. The shock of the unexpectedly violent wind causes your mount to circle around the lip and attempt to dive back into the cavern. Blind with fear, it no longer responds to your commands, forcing you to take drastic action to avoid being carried back into the gorge. As you swoop past a rocky outcrop, you leap from the creature<ch.apos/>s back and abandon yourself to the mercy of the crosswinds. Only your Kai Mastery and your lightning-swift reactions save you from being crushed to death as you are blown towards the jagged, volcanic edge.</p>
      <p>Miraculously, you survive the impact and are able to haul yourself out of the vent and climb safely onto a surface that, you assume, is the roof of the cavern. Seeking shelter from the raging crosswinds, you squeeze yourself into a hollow in the porous rock from where you are able to take stock of your new surroundings. The sight makes you gasp, for it is a view to rival the fertile wonders of the cavern below.</p>

      <p>You are within a dozen paces of the stairs when suddenly one of the grey-skinned creatures turns and sniffs the air; it has detected your scent. It scans the hall and the moment its ghoulish eyes focus on your body it raises the alarm. Frantically, its ragged brothers scramble to the stairs to deny you access to the balcony and archway above.</p>

      <p>The first thing you see is the creature<ch.apos/>s eyes. Like two strips of molten sulphur, they radiate a cold, yellow light. Then you glimpse the outline of its angular shoulders, its square snout, and its gleaming steel forelegs. Oily drool hangs from an iron jaw which is set with jagged blades. As this shocking jaw widens, you hear the whirr of metal cogs and gears.</p>
      <p>You can be fearless in the face of foes of flesh and blood, but this steel wolf strikes terror in your heart. You turn and flee towards the distant door, praying that it will lead to a safe haven from this bloodless beast, but you reach it only to discover that it is locked. Frantically you search for a bolt or a keyhole but there are none. Then you locate two squares of opaque crimson gemstone set into the wall. The squares are like those you encountered at the entrance to the temple of Avaros, yet these differ in one important respect: they are separated by a small slot.</p>

      <p>You lower yourself through the hole and catch sight of Wolf<ch.apos/>s Bane running away. He is clutching at his injured leg as he weaves and swerves to avoid the debris which litters his escape route. You move to follow him, but your attention is momentarily distracted by something that has fallen from his tunic pocket. It is a small disc of bronze that is engraved with alien symbols. (You must keep this Bronze Disc. Record it on your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a> as a Special Item. You must discard one non-weapon Special Item in its favour if you already hold the maximum number permissible.)</p>
      <p>You pocket the disc and give chase. Despite his wounded leg, your adversary is more familiar with this treacherous cityscape and he widens the gap between you. Soon you have lost sight of him completely. However, he cannot shake you off his trail, and you have no difficulty following his tracks as they leave the building and wend their way across a desolate wasteland beyond. You follow his footprints to a gutted building, several storeys high, which is adorned with strangely angular gargoyles. The inside of this crumbling edifice is completely empty and your adversary<ch.apos/>s trail passes through it to a rear exit. As you emerge on the far side, you catch your first breathtaking glimpse of this grim city<ch.apos/>s tallest structure.</p>
      <p>It is a great tower of gleaming black stone which rises from the depths of a fathomless moat and soars to within a hundred feet of the stormy grey clouds. Its pitted surface bristles with metal discs and antennae, streaked with rust, yet there are few windows and you can see but one portal. Wolf<ch.apos/>s Bane is limping towards it. He approaches the deep trench that rings the tower<ch.apos/>s base and, as he halts at the edge, a semi-transparent drawbridge extends from beneath the portal. It resembles a flattened beam of solid, green-grey light. This beam bridges the moat and provides your enemy with a means to reach the open tower door.</p>
      <p>Powerless to stop him, you can only stand and watch as he crosses the moat and disappears into the tower. At first glance this stronghold looks to be impregnable, but you have gained access to far tougher fortresses in the past and you do not allow your spirits to be dampened by the difficult task of finding a way into this one.</p>

      <p>Patiently you watch the warrior kicking at the smouldering remains of the iron chest. The moment he turns away, you utter the completing word of the spell and let loose your Arrow at his back. The tip of the Arrow ignites in flight, the magical flame illuminating the gloom as it arcs towards your unwary target with deadly precision. The fiery point penetrates deep into the metal canister strapped to the warrior<ch.apos/>s back and, in a terrifying instant, he and his sorcerous weapon are engulfed by a crackling mass of electrical energy. He screams and staggers across the floor, his limbs and torso trailing blue-white snakes of light which earth themselves to the surrounding metal debris. Then, finally, the energy that is contained within the canister is expended. Released from his torment, he loses his balance and falls heavily to the floor.</p>

He draws power from the armour he wears and he uses it to break your grip. In desperation you utter the words of the Old Kingdom Spell <spell>Energy Grasp</spell> and use it to discharge a powerful pulse of energy into the fabric of his armour. The effect is devastating. His armour disintegrates, crushing him to death as it crumples and compresses his body.</p>

      <p>From the cover of the leafy undergrowth you observe the primitive settlement for several minutes. During this vigil, you are bitten on the wrist by a small, ugly-looking spider which you crush immediately under your heel. The spider<ch.apos/>s bite is poisonous, but you are saved from a long and painful death by your innate Kai healing powers which eradicate the venom from your blood: lose 3 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points.</p>
      <p>As time ticks by you become increasingly restless. You can detect no signs of life around the settlement and you are haunted by the fear that you may have allowed your adversary<ch.apos/>s trail to go cold. Prompted by this anxiety, you move closer to the settlement under cover of the thick jungle foliage. The line of deserted mud huts looks innocuous, but the words of the voice of Naar still linger in your memory. This humid jungle realm lies within his domain; it is therefore reasonable to expect that any inhabitants of this place will be wholly devoted to the cause of Evil.</p>

      <p>You reach the edge of the undergrowth and pause to assess potential threats. The huts are semi-derelict, all bearing some signs of neglect and decay.

You magnify your vision and at once you detect steps in the wall of this excavation, leading underground.</p>

      <p>You lower yourself through the hole in the floor and quickly give chase. Wolf<ch.apos/>s Bane sprints through the ruined building, leaping obstacles with a catlike grace that rivals your own legendary agility. He is more familiar with this treacherous cityscape and, despite your best efforts, he soon widens the gap between you until you lose sight of him completely. Yet he cannot shake you off his trail, and you have no difficulty following his tracks as they leave the building and wend their way across the desolate wasteland beyond. You follow his footprints to a gutted building, several storeys high, which is adorned with strangely angular gargoyles. The inside of this crumbling edifice is completely empty and your adversary<ch.apos/>s trail passes through it to a rear exit. As you emerge on the far side, you catch your first breathtaking glimpse of this grim city<ch.apos/>s tallest structure.</p>
      <p>It is a great tower of gleaming black stone which rises from the depths of a fathomless moat and soars to within a hundred feet of the stormy grey clouds. Its pitted surface bristles with metal discs and antennae, streaked with rust, yet there are few windows and you can see but one portal. Wolf<ch.apos/>s Bane is running towards it. He approaches the deep trench that rings the tower<ch.apos/>s base and, as he halts at the edge, a semi-transparent drawbridge extends from beneath the portal. It resembles a flattened beam of solid, green-grey light. This beam bridges the moat and provides your enemy with a means to reach the open tower door.</p>
      <p>Powerless to stop him, you can only stand and watch as he crosses the moat and disappears into the tower. At first glance this stronghold looks to be impregnable, but you have gained access to far tougher fortresses in the past and you do not allow your spirits to be dampened by the difficult task of finding a way into this one.</p>

      <p><quote>Calm yourself, Foilan,</quote> says Baron Medar, <quote>this is the true Lone Wolf, not the impostor who stalks our land. What news have you?</quote></p>
      <p><quote>Sire<ch.ellips/>the Kai impostor has been sighted within the hour by rangers in the city<ch.apos/>s North Quarter. They tried to take him captive but he slew two and wounded three of their number before escaping into the old necropolis. The city watch now have both entrances to the necropolis secure<ch.emdash/>he will not be permitted to escape.</quote></p>
      <p><quote>Very good, my lord,</quote> retorts the Baron. <quote>So we have him cornered.</quote></p>
      <p><quote>If he<ch.apos/>s gone to ground in the old necropolis,</quote> says Banedon, <quote>he<ch.apos/>ll be hard to track down. The catacombs of that ancient burial field are vast. It could take months to search them all.</quote></p>
      <p><quote>Never fear,</quote> you say confidently. <quote>With the help of my able young Kai Masters I shall track and trap this impostor before dawn.</quote></p>
      <p><quote>Aye, my lord,</quote> pipes Star Lynx, elated by the thought of the hunt, <quote>we<ch.apos/>ll flush this cur from his hole before sunrise and bring him to justice.</quote></p>
      <p>Guided by Lord Foilan, you take your leave of Banedon and Baron Medar and depart from the castle on horseback, accompanied by your eager Kai. During your ride through the twisting, lantern-lit streets of Tyso, you learn from Foilan that there are only two ways in and out of the city<ch.apos/>s old necropolis: by its South Gate or by its Western Arch.</p>
      <p><quote>The impostor fled into the burial ground by the South Gate, my lord,</quote> says Foilan, <quote>but that was more<ch.apos/>n an hour ago. He<ch.apos/>ll be deep un<ch.apos/>erground by now.</quote></p>

      <p>Before your disbelieving eyes there spreads a vast volcanic landscape, punctuated by mountainous dunes of blue-grey sand and columns of towering rock. The amber sky is mottled and banded, like the eye of an angry tiger, and within its fathomless reaches you count twelve multi-coloured moons. These glowing spheres cast their light upon the burnt and crusty soil, lending it a ghostly aspect. Thick clouds, black and turgid, swollen with humid vapours, rear up like shadowy castles upon the far horizon. You can feel coarse grains of sand in the stinging crosswinds and your senses warn that a storm is fast approaching.</p>
      <p>Seeking safer shelter from the coming storm, you get to your feet and cast your eyes across this warm yet unwelcoming land. Away to your right, lying less than a mile distant within a shallow basin of age-worn rock, you see a monstrous temple crafted from opaque black glass. Spikes of crystal embellish its many tiers and atop its highest level there stands a tower, tall and sleek.</p>

      <p>A square of yellow light marks an open portal at the tower<ch.apos/>s base. You glimpse something standing in the doorway and, when you magnify your vision, you see that it is a cloaked warrior silhouetted against the portal<ch.apos/>s fiery glow. Your pulse quickens the instant you recognize the warrior. It is your accursed adversary<ch.emdash/>Wolf<ch.apos/>s Bane.</p>
      <p>The compelling urge to move northwards, that you felt shortly after you broke free from the plant stem, returns to haunt your senses. You feel drawn towards the temple as if you are being summoned by a force beyond this world. Your Sixth Sense screams danger, and every fibre of your being knows it should resist, but you suppress these natural instincts and set off towards the temple. This towering edifice holds many dangers, of that you are in no doubt, yet bravely you resolve to confront and overcome them. Only by doing so can you hope to triumph over your enemy and find a way back to your home world of Magnamund.</p>
      <p>During your difficult trek to the temple, unless you possess the Discipline of Grand Huntmastery you must eat a Meal or lose 3 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points.</p>

      <p>The doors swing open onto a gallery which encircles three sides of a large banquet hall. Below, through the wooden spindles of the gallery<ch.apos/>s parapet rail, you can see the hall itself. Tapestries drape the walls and a blazing fire crackles in a great stone fireplace that occupies much of the north wall. Your adversary is sitting alone in a throne-like chair at the head of a long banqueting table. A plain, oblong-shaped wooden case lies closed on the table before him.</p>
      <p><quote>Welcome, Lone Wolf<ch.emdash/>so glad you could join me,</quote> he says, his voice oozing sarcasm as he gets to his feet and tilts his head condescendingly towards the gallery. You see his right hand move below the edge of the table and, moments later, you hear the double doors swing shut and lock behind you. Anxiously you cast your eyes around the hall, searching out his hidden accomplices.</p>
      <p><quote>We<ch.apos/>re alone,</quote> snaps Wolf<ch.apos/>s Bane. He raises a hand and beckons you to descend the gallery stairs to the hall below. <quote>The time has come, Lone Wolf. Our jaunt across Avaros has been leading to this moment of truth.</quote></p>

      <p>This lock looks similar to that which operates the door to the temple of Avaros, yet there is one important difference. The mechanism of this lock is genuinely protected by a powerful spell, shielded also by magic to prevent its detection. Your unsuccessful attempt to open the portal triggers this spell and causes a massive bolt of electrical energy to be discharged through your fingers, along your outstretched arm, and deep into your body.</p>
      <p>A blinding flash of light obliterates your vision and an agonizing pain explodes in your chest. The pain quickly fades, but it is replaced by a terrifying numbness. You feel weightless, as if you are falling through deep space. Briefly you try to resist this sensation but it is no use. You are falling into a sleep from which you will never awaken.</p>

You wait until the very last moment before twisting aside to avoid its lunge and, as it streaks past, you deal it a backhanded blow which tears a hole in its silvery wing. The wound is not fatal, but the damage to its wing is enough to render the hungry creature incapable of ascending any higher. It emits a loud buzz of frustration which fades as it slowly spirals away towards a cluster of smaller dragonflies hovering near the centre of the gorge.</p>
      <p>At length you reach the apex of the cavern and soar into the light-filled vent.

      <p>You survive the impact and are able to haul yourself out of the vent and climb safely onto a surface that you assume to be the roof of the cavern. Seeking shelter from the raging crosswinds, you squeeze yourself into a hollow in the porous rock from where you are able to take stock of your new surroundings. The sight makes you gasp, for it is a view that truly rivals the fertile wonders of the cavern below.</p>

      <p>Before you stands a great tower of gleaming black stone which rises from the depths of a fathomless moat and soars to within a hundred feet of the stormy grey clouds. Its pitted surface bristles with metal discs and antennae, streaked with rust, yet there are few windows and you can see but one portal.</p>

You watch this area for several minutes, and then you see two armour-clad warriors emerge from the ruins and approach it. Suddenly a semi-transparent drawbridge extends from beneath the portal. It resembles a flattened beam of solid, green-grey light, and this beam bridges the moat and provides the two warriors with the means to reach the open tower door.</p>
      <p>You scan the great tower with your senses and you feel sure that your opponent is lurking somewhere within. Powerless to reach him, you can only stand and watch the two warriors as they cross the moat and disappear into the portal, which slides shut behind them. At first glance this stronghold looks to be impregnable, but you have gained access to far tougher fortresses in the past and you refuse to allow your spirits to be dampened by the daunting task of finding a way into this one.</p>

      <p>By the time you reach the base of the temple, the storm is howling like a vengeful demon in your ears. Stinging blasts of hot, sand-laden wind whip your face mercilessly and you are forced to lean almost horizontally into the storm to maintain your balance. The storm is increasing in ferocity by the minute. You are sorely aware that you must find cover within an hour at most or you will perish in this hellish blizzard.</p>
      <p>An empty parapeted stairway ascends from the temple<ch.apos/>s lowermost tier to the portal of its crowning tower. The parapet offers you protection from the wind and you climb the many steps bent over, almost on your hands and knees, in order to stay out of the abrasive storm. Before you ascend the last tier, you check to make sure that your adversary is not lying in ambush. The portal is now closed and you can sense no living creature nearby, yet you unsheathe your weapon from your belt and hold it ready in case danger should come from an unsuspected quarter.</p>
      <p>When you reach the portal, you discover that it comprises a seamless sheet of lead-lined iron, many inches thick. You detect a lingering aura of magic around its threshold which makes you wary that a trap may have been set. Yet when you summon your psychic skills to probe deeper, you sense otherwise. You detect that Wolf<ch.apos/>s Bane has deliberately cast an illusion of magic around this portal, no doubt in the hope that it will delay or deter you long enough for the storm to do its work. Confident that the door is not lethal, you examine it more closely. Set flush into the glassy surface of its surrounding arch, you discover an inscription above two squares of dull crimson gemstone. Your Sixth Sense reveals that tapping upon each square a correct number of times will cause the door to open. Cautiously you place your fingers lightly upon the squares and feel the gentle vibration of the door<ch.apos/>s locking mechanism. By concentrating on these vibrations you hope to be able to decipher its locking codes.</p>
      <p>After several minutes you determine that the first code is equal to the <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points score below which a Grand Master cannot use the Discipline of Kai-surge.</p>

Almost immediately, another panel slides out of the metal wall and seals off the passage ahead, trapping you in the cell-like space between. You throw yourself against the steel door and run your hands over its smooth surface, searching frantically for a means to escape. Your efforts are made all the more urgent when suddenly a loud hissing sound fills your ears; it is the sound of the air being extracted from this cell.</p>
      <p>Gasping for breath, you turn around to search the opposite panel. Your hopes rise when you see a combination lock set flush into its surface. It is unlike the lock which secured the entrance to the temple of Avaros, but your Kai senses soon detect how it operates. The lock is inlaid with five dials in two groups. There is one group of three and one group of two. Each dial indicates a number. One dial however, in the group of two, is set to zero.

Cautiously you move nearer to inspect the slab of stone and discover an intricate design scratched upon its surface. It has been smeared with dirt and a magical spell of shielding has been placed upon it to disguise its true purpose, yet you immediately realize what it is and you recoil from the slab, hurriedly retreating a dozen paces. It is a glyph of power: a magical booby trap that has been expertly camouflaged to keep it secret. If anyone or anything were to step upon or pass over this glyph, the energy contained within it would be released in one devastating instant.</p>

      <p>Your Kai Mastery skills and your sheer will to survive save you from succumbing to a grisly death in this morass. After an agonizing ordeal, you finally reach the door at the end of the hall and haul yourself through it. Aching with fatigue (lose 4 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points), you lie on the solid flagstones for several minutes until you regain sufficient strength to be able to continue your hunt for Wolf<ch.apos/>s Bane.</p>
      <p>You can feel a warm breeze wafting along this hall and you sense that it comes from a stairwell at the far end. When you investigate it, you rediscover Wolf<ch.apos/>s Bane<ch.apos/>s footprints on the stone steps. You cast your hands over them and detect that this is not a false trail: your enemy passed this way sometime within the last hour.</p>
      <p>Slowly you ascend the stairs and arrive at the arched entrance to a large, vaulted stone chamber. Gathered around a fountain set into its north wall are a group of six grey-skinned humanoids. They are busy drinking a clear, oily fluid that pours from the fountain<ch.apos/>s spout into a semicircular trough. All are barefoot and clad in rags, and they are each armed with a spear and a bow. The only exit from this chamber appears to be an archway set high in the north wall. There is a balcony in front of it that can only be reached by two flights of stairs which rise up on either side of the fountain.</p>
      <p>Quietly you observe the creatures slaking their thirsts, and you try to formulate a way in which you can get past them and reach the balconied exit in the north wall.</p>

      <p>Baron Caldar escorts you and Banedon to the roof of his castle<ch.apos/>s main tower where, hovering above, you see the great gleaming hull of the Guildmaster<ch.apos/>s skyship<ch.emdash/><cite>Cloud-dancer</cite>. At Banedon<ch.apos/>s signal a cage is lowered from the stern of this magical vessel and, after bidding farewell to the Baron, you are both hoisted aboard. The crew, some of whom are survivors from his previous skyship<ch.emdash/><cite>Skyrider</cite><ch.emdash/>are clearly agitated by your unexpected appearance; the sibilant hiss of their fearful whispers echoes softly along the deck. But immediately Banedon vouches that you are not the impostor who has terrorized Sommerlund these past few weeks and this swiftly allays his crew<ch.apos/>s suspicions. As you accompany the Guildmaster to his quarters, the mood of the men and dwarves of the ship<ch.apos/>s complement changes. Respectfully they salute you and welcome you with pride aboard their wondrous craft.</p>
      <p>The <cite>Cloud-dancer</cite> sets sail and follows a southwesterly bearing for the city of Tyso, over one hundred miles distant. The night sky is clear and Javano, the ship<ch.apos/>s pilot, is confident that you will arrive within the hour. During the brief voyage, Banedon communicates magically with the elders of his Brotherhood in Toran. He informs them of your safe return and tells them of your plans to track down the impostor. In response they assure him that word of your return will be conveyed at once to the King in Holmgard, and to your beleaguered kinsmen at the Kai Monastery. This glad news does much to lift your bruised spirits.</p>
      <p>It seems as if you have been aboard the <cite>Cloud-dancer</cite> for no more than a few minutes when a message arrives from the forward lookout: <quote>Tyso lights due south.</quote> You leave Banedon<ch.apos/>s comfortable quarters below deck and accompany him to the prow rail from where you catch your first aerial glimpse of the distant city-port. The warm lantern light of hovels and taverns shimmers like a captive cluster of stars within the city<ch.apos/>s protective wall. At the Guildmaster<ch.apos/>s command, Javano begins the skyship<ch.apos/>s descent and, as the twinkling lights loom larger, you are able to make out the silhouette of a grand castle that is perched on a headland overlooking the harbour.</p>
      <p><quote>There<ch.apos/>s our destination, Lone Wolf,</quote> says Banedon, cheerfully, <quote>the castle of Baron Tor Medar<ch.emdash/>the Seneschal of Tyso.</quote></p>

      <p>The creature that is diving towards you suddenly freezes in mid-air. The morbid fear of death that had gripped your heart quickly evaporates, but you are left with a feeling of deep unease as your Kai senses detect that something extraordinary is taking place around you. The hall has become filled with a deadly silence and everything, including the tongues of flame trailing from the creature<ch.apos/>s sword, and the blazing fire in the grate, is utterly frozen. It is as if time itself is standing still.</p>
      <p>Wolf<ch.apos/>s Bane is a frozen statue, his face fixed in the malevolent sneer he was wearing in gleeful anticipation that you were about to meet your doom. You are beginning to think that perhaps you have been killed and that this is life after death, when suddenly you glimpse a blurred movement at the corner of your eye.</p>
      <p>From out of the shadows cast by the gallery steps a young teenage girl, dressed in a leather jerkin and threadbare trousers. You recognize her at once<ch.emdash/>it is Alyss, the strange enigmatic creature who helped you once before, during your confrontation with the Demoness Shamath.</p>
      <p><quote>Wh<ch.ellips/>what are you doing here?</quote> you stammer. Casually she walks towards you and reaches up to touch a finger to the frozen fiery sword clutched in the taloned hands of Wolf<ch.apos/>s Bane<ch.apos/>s winged minion.</p>
      <p><quote>Why, doing what I like doing best,</quote> she replies, airily, <quote>minding other people<ch.apos/>s business.</quote></p>
      <p>She prods the frozen sword with the tip of her finger and there is a gentle <onomatopoeia>Pop!</onomatopoeia> Instantly the creature disappears.</p>
      <p><quote>I do hate cheats,</quote> she says, as she wanders over to where Wolf<ch.apos/>s Bane is standing immobile. Cheekily she pokes out her tongue at him and then she spins on her heel to face you.</p>
      <p><quote>Now, perhaps you can finish what you came here to do, Lone Wolf,</quote> she says, and claps her hands three times. A sudden rush of noise assails your ears and your senses reel as the reality of time comes flooding back into the hall.</p>

      <p>The thick, trunk-like stamen is covered with fine hairs which help you to make the long climb towards the amber-coloured light far above. However, as you get nearer to the light, the stamen hairs become coated with lumps of sticky, sweet-smelling yellow pollen. These pollen clusters hamper your progress as you have to struggle to unglue yourself from them every time you shift your position.</p>
      <p>You are nearing the stamen<ch.apos/>s bud-like top when you become aware of a distant buzzing sound. Rapidly the noise gets louder until you are suddenly plunged into semi-darkness. A huge winged insect is hovering directly above you, its multi-coloured body blotting out most of the pale amber sky. It lunges back and forth with its great head as it sucks away clumps of pollen from surrounding stamens with its long, spear-like proboscis. Then the creature detects your presence and the deafening noise of its wings changes pitch. It rises several feet above the stamen and hovers there for a few moments while it studies you with massive composite eyes. Unfortunately it takes only a few seconds for the creature to decide that it wants to vary its diet of pollen. With a sinister nod of its head, it extends its proboscis and then stabs its sticky point towards your unprotected back.</p>

One walks several paces behind the other, but both are on their way towards the tower. At first you are discouraged that there are two, fearing that an ambush will be harder to effect.

A sharp blow beneath the chin-guard of his helmet renders him unconscious, and swiftly you begin to strip away his armour. All is going to plan until a scraping noise behind alerts you to trouble. His companion has noticed that he is alone and has retraced his steps to investigate the sudden disappearance of his brother-in-arms.</p>
      <p>You are holding an armoured breastplate in both hands when he comes striding into the alley. You hurl it at him, hoping to buy yourself a few precious seconds in which you can unsheathe your weapon, but the warrior bats it aside and attempts to close his hands around your throat.</p>

      <p>Your Arrow hits its mark and penetrates deep into the creature<ch.apos/>s eye socket. There is a splash of white sparks and a crackle of electrical arcing as the tip punches through the back of its steel skull, and yet the beast comes on. The wound has inflicted serious damage to its sight and senses, but it does not stop it from pressing home its attack. You have barely one second remaining in which to unsheathe a hand weapon as this great metallic horror launches itself at your chest.</p>

      <p>From the uppermost reaches of the tower there descends an icy fog which radiates an intensely powerful aura of Evil. This menacing mist darkens as it swirls around the lower levels, like some huge vaporous snake seeking out its prey. Then, slowly, it gathers in towards the centre of the chamber where it hangs above the plinth like an angry thunderhead, roiling and seething with colossal malevolence.</p>
      <p>You gaze into this black cloud and are gripped by an abject terror the instant you fathom its nature and purpose. This cloud is not of this world and it has not fully taken on substance and being within the material plane of Aon, yet even in its malformed state you recognize it to be a materialization of ultimate Evil. This is a manifestation of Naar<ch.emdash/>the King of the Darkness!</p>
      <p>Suddenly a deafening clap of thunder shakes the walls and the base of the tower is lit up by crackling arcs of lightning. The freezing air seethes with tension as the presence of Naar triggers explosive chemical imbalances within it. Then, above the crackling cacophony of noise, you hear a chilling voice speaking to you in your native tongue.</p>
      <p><quote>Disciple of Kai<ch.emdash/>you know my name. Will you not deign to speak it?</quote></p>
      <p>Morbid terror is ripping at your insides yet you refuse to show the slightest trace of weakness. You steel yourself and inwardly you pray to Kai and Ishir to protect you in this hour of deepest need.</p>
      <p><quote>No!</quote> you scream. <quote>I will never acknowledge you!</quote></p>
      <p><quote>You may be one of Kai<ch.apos/>s favourite minions,</quote> retorts the voice, <quote>but you will always be mortal. You would do well to remember that in my presence.</quote> Thunder booms and the floor shakes beneath your feet, causing you to fall involuntarily to your knees.</p>
      <p><quote>Now that you bow before me, Lone Wolf, I shall impart to you your fate, for I am the true master of Aon. This is Avaros, a small and insignificant satellite of Duron, a world that has long been devoted to my cause. And you have been lured here for one purpose<ch.emdash/>to be destroyed. During the speck of time that you have existed, you have become an impertinent obstacle to my conquest of Magnamund. For this you will forfeit your soul. Yet, before I claim your worthless soul, I shall make sport of your demise so that Kai and Ishir shall see the worthlessness of their creations and know the futility of their cause.</quote></p>
      <p>Once more the thunder booms and you are blinded momentarily by a flash of white fire. Slowly your sight returns, and now you can see your adversary<ch.emdash/>Wolf<ch.apos/>s Bane<ch.emdash/>standing upon the plinth, directly under the menacing black cloud.</p>
      <p><quote>Here is my champion,</quote> speaks the voice of Naar. <quote>You and he are well-matched for the contest that is about to commence.</quote></p>
      <p>Wolf<ch.apos/>s Bane unsheathes his sword and levels it your chest. His facial features twist into a grotesque parody of your own as he spits out a venomous threat:</p>
      <p><quote>Victory will be mine, Lone Wolf. Evil shall ultimately triumph!</quote></p>
      <p>You shout a defiant riposte, but the voice of Naar booms once more, drowning your worthy cry:</p>
      <p><quote>So be it! Let the duel begin!</quote></p>

      <p>For two hours you observe the tower. During this time you sense that an invisible field of energy surrounds the wall, a defence that complements the terrifyingly deep moat. This force field disappears only when the portal opens and the drawbridge extends to allow for the arrival or departure of armoured warriors, or strange horseless wagons that hover a few feet from the ground, but in the main the great door remains firmly closed.</p>
      <p>You notice that the sparse traffic of warriors and wagons passes along one avenue. It is the only thoroughfare approaching the tower which has been cleared of debris. It is an uncomfortable vigil, but the time you spend observing the tower is rewarded when a bold plan gradually takes form in your mind.</p>
      <p>You assess that an entry to the tower could be effected by two means: if you were able to ambush a warrior and use his armour as a disguise, or, if you were able to stow away aboard one of the wagons approaching the moat.</p>

      <p>The moment you pass through the storm clouds, you enter a stratosphere that is bathed with magnificent light. Above the city<ch.apos/>s perpetual cloud layer lies a wondrous vista, an aerial realm that is calm and clear. The golden rays from two suns and the reflected light from twelve satellite moons, combine to bathe the thunderheads with a panoply of colour. You scan these heavens and see high above the dragonfly which is carrying Wolf<ch.apos/>s Bane. It is climbing towards a castle-like fortress that seems to rest upon a base of wispy cloud, defying gravity. Your enemy<ch.apos/>s flying mount enters the castle from below, passing through a gap in the underside of its cloudy base. Upon seeing his destination you urge your own winged mount to follow in his wake.</p>

Beyond the portal is a cavern of stone, vaulted and substantial like the dungeons of a great castle. There is no sign of your enemy, save for his mount which is tethered to a wooden pier. You bring your dragonfly in to land upon this pier and then leap down from its back and examine the ground for tracks. You find what you are seeking and they lead you to an archway that opens upon a landing where three tunnels lead off in different directions. However, to your dismay, you discover that Wolf<ch.apos/>s Bane has deliberately spoiled his tracks; his footprints lead to all three tunnels.</p>

The warrior follows your swift move and discharges a second beam from his spear which slams into the iron chest with stunning force. You gasp with horror as you see the side of the chest bulging towards your face. Its thick rivets tremble and its age-blackened skin smoulders with a sullen heat. Instinct takes over, making you roll away from the iron chest and seek cover elsewhere.

      <p>The two reptilians have exhausted their supply of arrows and are frantically working at the chain in an effort to lower their iron pot to the floor of the vault. You can see that it will only be a matter of minutes before they accomplish their task.</p>
      <p>Anxious to evade them, you examine the portal for a lever or some other means to make it rise. To the left of the tunnel arch you discover two squares of opaque crimson gemstone separated by a small slot. The squares are similar in size and design to those you encountered at the entrance to the temple of Avaros. These, too, comprise a locking mechanism that controls this portal. By tapping upon each square a correct number of times you will cause the lock to disengage and the portal to rise.</p>
      <p>You place your fingers lightly upon the squares and feel the tell-tale vibrations that are the key to deciphering the secret code. After only seconds you are able to determine that the first code is equal to the number of islands south of the Kirlundin island of Hemd.</p>
      <p>The second code is equal to the number of villages that lie on the highway between the cities of Toran and Anskaven.</p>

      <p><quote>Follow me, my lords!</quote> shouts Foilan, as he spurs his black mare along a narrow, cobblestoned street that wends its way through Tyso<ch.apos/>s shabby North Quarter. At a junction close by the city<ch.apos/>s main stables, he turns into an avenue that leads to the West Arch of the Old Necropolis.</p>
      <p>When the Arch is less than a hundred yards distant, Foilan brings his horse to a halt and you rein in your steed beside him. Several dozen guards and rangers have gathered at the Arch and they have erected a barricade which completely blocks the entrance to the burial ground beyond. The Reeve-lieutenant tells you to wait here with your men while he goes forward to inform the guards of the situation and to tell them that you and your companions are not Kai impostors.</p>
      <p>Patiently you wait for Foilan to complete his task. Then, on seeing his signal, you move forward and join him at the Western Arch. He shouts an order and hurriedly the guards pull aside a wagon which blocks the entrance, enabling the five of you to dismount and proceed into the necropolis on foot.</p>
      <p>Aided by the moonlight, you lead your party along a gravelled path towards the centre of the burial ground, to where a tunnel-like opening has been excavated in the side of a mossy mound. On arriving at this shadowy entrance you stop to examine the surrounding area, to check for any clues that may help you track your quarry. You find no fresh prints and you sense no lingering aura of an evil that could betray his presence. Confident that it is safe to proceed, you enter the mound and lead your comrades down a wide stone ramp to an oval-shaped chamber. A dozen stone coffins, each carved with the likeness of its occupant, are laid out in a circle like the spokes of a wheel. The chamber is cold and unwelcoming, but it does not harbour any trace of evil. You are sure that the impostor has not set foot here.</p>
      <p>On the far side of the burial chamber, opposite the ramp, there is a stairwell which descends deep into the catacombs below the necropolis. You go down these stairs until you come to a landing where a passage crosses from north to south. Black Hawk suggests that the party split in two and explore both ways, but you are not in favour of this idea. Splitting the party would make it easier for the impostor if he chose to launch an ambush. You peer along both passages and draw on your Grand Master skills to determine the best route to follow, but with little success. Neither passage looks especially inviting.</p>

      <p>You enter the building at ground level and follow your adversary<ch.apos/>s tracks to a mouldering hall at the rear of this derelict dwelling. From the cover of a shadowy alcove you watch as Wolf<ch.apos/>s Bane meets and converses with two warriors. They are both helmeted and clad in suits of close-fitting grey armour. They have shiny steel spears slung over their shoulders which radiate a faint hum of electrical power. Their meeting is brief. Wolf<ch.apos/>s Bane issues terse commands and the two warriors leave to enact his orders. As you watch them go, you hazard a guess that their mission is to find and kill you.</p>

      <p>Wolf<ch.apos/>s Bane leaves the hall by a broken rear door. You wait for a few minutes, to reduce the risk that he may detect how near you are, and then you follow his trail. The rear of the building opens onto a wasteland of shattered rubble which is bisected by a dead stream of salty, acidic water. You follow your opponent<ch.apos/>s trail across this bleak and forbidding landscape, past sharp spires of crimson and jet that erupt through the dereliction to scratch the cloudy sky. Rust-red water encircles their bases, lending them a wholly sinister aspect. To your eyes it seems as if this blighted city has been impaled upon these cruel, towering spikes.</p>
      <p>Beyond the spires you see Wolf<ch.apos/>s Bane descending a flight of stone steps that disappear into the ground. Suddenly he stops and looks in your direction; it is as if he has sensed you are on his trail. Instinctively you dive to take cover behind a broken wall, but as you hit the ground it collapses, dumping you unceremoniously into a cellar that is flooded with black, briny water.</p>
      <p>Coughing and spluttering, you bob to the surface and reach out to grab at a stone step. It is the lowest of a flight of slime-smeared steps that rise out of the water and ascend to a trapdoor in the ceiling. Suddenly you see two fiery red eyes emerging from the darkness and your stomach churns. They belong to the hungry, rubbery-skinned creature that dwells in this dismal cellar. It reaches out to grab you with its taloned hands, but you avoid its attack by wrenching at its wrist, sending it somersaulting over your head to splash into the water. Quickly you attempt to pull yourself onto the slippery steps before this creature recovers and tries to attack again.</p>

      <p>Before you lies a smoke-filled hall that reeks of death and decay. Only the floor appears to be solid, and yet when you stare down at its glassy surface, you see that it is honeycombed with thousands of cells, each one occupied by a tortured soul writhing in perpetual torment. The walls of this evil chamber are wreathed with sulphurous smoke, lit intermittently by shafts of crimson lightning. The foul substances which pass for air seethe with the tension of ferocious, evil energies.</p>
      <p>From the centre of the floor there arises a slender domed plinth. Moments later, a wide dais rises beside it, upon which you see a visage of the Dark God, one that he favours whilst occupying his unholy throne hall. Nothing could have prepared you for the sight that now meets your gaze<ch.emdash/>it is the foulest you have ever seen.</p>
      <p>Naar<ch.apos/>s favoured form is a great globular body, like that of a bloated spider, borne by a score of stunted limbs which emerge chaotically from the underside of a sac-like abdomen. His face hangs like a parody of a wrinkled old sow<ch.apos/>s yet with an evil-smelling black hole where one could expect a snout. The upper surface of his body is covered with pouches of vile fluids that trail wisps of black smoke, and his maw is studded with hundreds of blue-stained fangs. But it is the eyes that shock you most. The Dark God has the eyes of a man.</p>

      <p>Naar shifts his bloated body from the dais and slither-shuffles towards the plinth. A misshapen limb extends to the plinth and its domed cover retracts to reveal a wondrous and mysterious artefact. A second shock stuns your senses when you recognize the nature of this artefact. It is one of the most legendary items in all the long history of Magnamund. It is the fabled Moonstone of the Shianti!</p>

      <p>You have come to the edge of a deep canyon. The verdant walls of this massive gorge are carpeted with a rainbow of colour and the air is alive with the busy noise of huge, buzzing insects. Everything is fecund and fertile and dripping with humid jungle heat. High above the gorge you glimpse for the first time the source of the light which illuminates this strangely wonderful realm. The canyon is set within a cavern, the walls of which seem to engulf the sky. At its apex there is an oval-shaped vent through which a concentrated shower of amber rays pours down, like sunbeams through a stained glass portal. You watch in awe as flights of dragonflies, each as large as a Vassagonian Itikar, circle languidly above the canyon on gossamer wings. They shimmer like streaks of liquid silver as they ride the thermal currents. The sight is one of great beauty, yet one you cannot fully enjoy. The instinct which led you to the rim of this gorge now tells you that the source of the power you seek lies several miles away and above, beyond the vent that is the source of this cavern<ch.apos/>s light. Carefully you consider your predicament and determine that in order to escape, you must reach the vent<ch.emdash/>an exit that lies more than a thousand feet above the rim of the gorge.</p>

The street is deserted yet many citizens witness your passing. Their eyes glint in the moonlight as they peep through the smoky yellow panes of their windows, their curiosity and fears awakened by the clatter of your horses<ch.apos/> hooves.</p>
      <p>At length the street opens onto a wider avenue which gently descends towards a sprawling expanse of derelict ground surrounded by a tall, moss-covered perimeter wall. Several dozen guards and rangers have gathered at a distant archway in this wall and, by magnifying your vision, you can see that they have erected a barricade which completely blocks the entrance to the burial ground beyond.</p>

      <p>In the moonlight, the burial ground has a certain ghostly beauty. There is an aura of sad serenity surrounding its mouldering tombs as, with the passing of centuries, they crumble to dust and disappear with their secret memories of another age. But all is not what it seems. Your Sixth Sense detects the lingering aura of an evil entity that has invaded this place. A glance at your fellow Kai tells you that they, too, can sense its presence.</p>
      <p>You clasp the Platinum Amulet and feel a tingling vibration run through the palm of your hand. The sensation grows stronger as you move along a weed-choked path which leads to a shadowy tomb. With the passage of the years this tomb has settled lopsidedly into the soft Tysoan earth, yet a flight of damp stone steps descends to where its door once was. As you draw nearer, you notice that all that now remains of the door is a mound of broken rubble.</p>

      <p>You leap over the battered remains and continue along this winding tunnel until you reach an empty chamber. Here you can feel a warm breeze and you sense that it comes from a stairwell in the far wall.

You cast your hands over them and detect that this is not a false trail; your enemy passed this way sometime within the last hour.</p>
      <p>Slowly you ascend the stairs and arrive at the arched entrance to a large, vaulted stone chamber. Gathered around a fountain set into its north wall are a group of six grey-skinned humanoids. They are busy drinking a clear, oily fluid that pours from the fountain<ch.apos/>s spout into a semicircular trough. All are barefoot and clad in rags, and they are each armed with a spear and a bow.

There is a balcony in front of it that can only be reached by two flights of stairs which rise up on either side of the fountain.</p>
      <p>Quietly you observe the creatures slaking their thirsts, and you try to formulate a way in which you can get past them and reach the balconied exit in the north wall.</p>

      <p>You race along the passageway and turn the corner to see a tunnel sloping away into the gloom. The walls and ceiling are dripping wet, indicating to you that this dingy passageway passes directly under the stream. You hurry along its narrow confines, your shoulders grazing its muddy walls as you run, until you arrive at a flight of steps that ascend to an archway supported by thick wooden beams. Beyond the arch lies a large subterranean chamber that is daubed and decorated with runes and evil insignia. It is a primitive temple and it radiates an aura of Evil so malicious that it makes your skin crawl.</p>

      <p>On the far side of this unholy place, you see a stone altar standing before a huge boulder that has been crudely chiselled to resemble a grinning human skull. An eerie green glow pulsates from the eye sockets of this great skull-rock, and a mist swirls from its open jaw. Wolf<ch.apos/>s Bane is at the centre of the chamber but he is moving quickly towards the altar. You command him to stop and face you, but he ignores your order and continues running until he reaches the jaw of the great stone skull, which is flanked by two staves of iron set into holes in the ground. Gasping for breath, he now turns to face you. For a moment his evil eyes dart towards one of the iron staves and he reaches out a hand as if to grasp it. But, seemingly, he changes his mind. He sees you entering the temple and he turns and runs into the open jaw of the skull to be swallowed up by the roiling mist.</p>
      <p>Quickly you pursue him, confident that you can maintain the upper hand so long as you do not lose his trail.</p>

      <p>Beyond where the illusory north wall once stood, you can now see a small antechamber which is wreathed in acrid blue smoke. Gradually this smoke dissipates to reveal a shallow plinth upon which lies a bronze urn. This heavy object rests on its side and a quantity of pale grey ash has spilled from its hinged lid. Cautiously you approach the urn and see that there is an inscription engraved on its side. From this ancient script you learn that the ashes are the last remains of Baroness Garrulen, the wife of Hul<ch.emdash/>third Baron of Tyso. Glinting half-buried in the ash, you notice a ring encrusted with crimson gemstones. (If you wish to keep this Ruby Ring, record it on your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a> as a Special Item.)</p>
      <p>You are righting the urn on its plinth when you hear Steel Hand calling you. He has found something among the rubble which litters the floor at the rear of the antechamber.</p>

You seize the chance to attack and you move up behind him and leap onto his undefended back. He fights tenaciously to free himself, but his struggle ends abruptly when you rip a steel cable from the canister that is strapped to his back. There is a dull boom, and an eruption of blue-white flame shoots from the top of the canister, burning open the back of his helm. The force of this blast hurls him forwards and leaves him sprawled across the cylinders that cover his slain comrade. For a few seconds a spidery net of pulsating light enshrouds the two lifeless warriors; then it crackles and disappears, leaving behind an acrid stench of scorched metal and roasted meat.</p>

But, as you return through the Shadow Gate to the land of your birth, you know that the fight against Evil is not yet over. If you are to prevent the Dark God from launching his armies of night into Magnamund, you must return to the Plane of Darkness and retrieve the fabled Moonstone. Only by doing so will Magnamund be safe from the ravages of Naar<ch.apos/>s unholy hordes.</p>
      <p>It will be a supremely perilous mission, perhaps the most dangerous you have ever undertaken. If you possess the true courage of a Kai Grand Master, the ultimate quest awaits you in the climax to the Grand Master series, entitled:</p>

       <p>The proud country of Sommerlund juts eastwards into the cold Kaltersee. To the west it abuts the grim, grey wall of the Durncrag Mountains, a natural barrier protecting the Sommlending from the evil Darklords of Helgedad. Despite its proximity to the Darklands, Sommerlund is a prosperous and fertile country, with many towns and villages. Dotted from north to south along the Durncrags lie border outposts and forts such as Shadow Pass to the west of the city of Toran, and Fort Durnspa, to the northwest of the capital city, Holmgard.</p>
       <p>North by northwest of Holmgard is Toran, while northeast is the city of Anskaven. Travelling west by southwest along the main highway from Anskaven through the villages of Pinestar, Doven, and Cherrison, would bring you to Toran. Sommerlund<ch.apos/>s other city, Tyso, lies about fifty miles northeast along the coast from Holmgard.</p>
       <p>Travelling east along the main highway from Holmgard to Durenor, a traveller would pass through the towns of Fairam and Eastgate, before the rugged hilly land gives way to the barren wasteland of the Wildlands. Two small Wildland villages cling to the coast, served by this highway, namely Vanosa and Duncrick, before the city of Ragadorn, which lies at the mouth of the River Dorn. Beyond Ragadorn, the highway continues east, with no further settlements for many leagues.</p>
       <p>To the east of Sommerlund, in the Gulf of Durenor, lie the Kirlundin Isles, a small archipelago of islands that descend in a lazy arc from northeast to south. Of the named Kirlundin Isles<ch.emdash/>from north to south, Broka, Egen, Thet, Hemd, Kirlu, and Mannon<ch.emdash/>only Kirlu is large enough to sustain more than one town or village of any size. Between the Kirlundins and the mainland of Sommerlund lie the Kirlundin Straits.</p>
