     <p>You are a Grand Master of the New Order of the Kai<ch.emdash/>the warrior <ch.eacute/>lite of Sommerlund.</p>

     <p>It is the year MS<ch.nbsp/>5083 and thirty-three years have passed since the First Order of the Kai was almost wiped out by the Darklords of Helgedad. These champions of evil, who were sent by the Dark God Naar to destroy your fertile world of Magnamund, have since been destroyed. The leader of your illustrious fighting order<ch.emdash/>Lone Wolf<ch.emdash/>was the sole survivor of the massacre. As a young Kai initiate he stood amidst the burning wreckage of the old Kai Monastery and vowed to avenge the slaughter of his comrades. In the year MS<ch.nbsp/>5070 he kept his pledge when alone he infiltrated the foul domain of the Darklords and destroyed the infernal city of Helgedad, the base of their evil power.</p>

     <p>With the fall of Helgedad, chaos befell the Darkland armies who had, until then, been poised to conquer all Magnamund. Quickly their disorder escalated into a mutinous civil war which allowed the Freeland armies of Magnamund time in which to recover and launch a successful counter-offensive. Against all odds, a swift and total victory was secured over the feuding armies of evil.</p>

     <p>Following the demise of the Darklords, peace reigned in your homeland of Sommerlund. Under the direction of Lone Wolf the ruined Monastery of the Kai was rebuilt and restored to its former glory, and the raising of a New Order of Kai warriors was swiftly established. You are one of the new generation of Kai recruits. You were born in Sommerlund in the year MS<ch.nbsp/>5063, during the time of the war against the Darklords. When you were seven years old you were sent by your father to the Kai Monastery. There, under the tutelage of Lone Wolf, you developed your martial skills and honed the special Kai abilities which lay dormant within you. During the years that followed, your skills were nurtured and sharpened to perfection by long hours of study and rigorous training. Your exceptional talent helped you to master all of the Kai and Magnakai Disciplines and you rose swiftly through the ranks of the New Order to become one of only five who now hold the high rank of Kai Grand Master. It is an achievement which has brought great honour upon you and your family.</p>

     <p>In the year MS<ch.nbsp/>5077 your skill and courage were put to the test when an attack was launched upon the Kai Monastery during Lone Wolf<ch.apos/>s absence. By means of a Shadow Gate (an astral corridor between the physical world of Magnamund and the many ethereal domains which lie beyond it) the Dark God Naar sent forth a host of dragon-creatures to besiege the monastery and lay waste to all Sommerlund. He had chosen his time well, yet his evil plan was thwarted by the tenacious defence that you and your brethren maintained until the siege was raised by Lone Wolf and the King<ch.apos/>s Army of Sommerlund.</p>

     <p>The defeat of his minions enraged Naar and inflamed his lust for vengeance. Three years later he created and sent to Sommerlund an evil champion called <quote>Wolf<ch.apos/>s Bane</quote> who was the very image of Lone Wolf. While your leader was engaged upon a quest overseas, this impostor terrorized your homeland in his guise and sought to destroy the reputation and the honour of the Kai. He would have succeeded had not Lone Wolf returned home and pursued this enemy to an ancient necropolis in the Sommlending city of Tyso. There, deep within a subterranean crypt, he and his evil alter-ego were drawn through a Shadow Gate to the Plane of Darkness<ch.emdash/>Naar<ch.apos/>s stronghold<ch.emdash/>where a deadly duel ensued. Lone Wolf vanquished the foe and discovered that Naar had in his possession the fabled Moonstone of the Shianti. This wondrous artefact was created many thousands of years ago by the god-like Shianti, whose presence upon Magnamund heralded the dawn of humanity. This stone of power contains the combined might of all their magic and wisdom, the sum of all their knowledge. So significant was the creation of this stone that all time on Magnamund has since been measured from the date of its creation. It had long been held that the Moonstone<ch.apos/>s location was a secret known only to the remnants of the Shianti, who dwell upon the mysterious Isle of Lorn in Southern Magnamund, yet the evidence of Lone Wolf<ch.apos/>s eyes had told him that this mystical artefact had somehow fallen into the hands of Naar.</p>

     <p>Lone Wolf realized that the Dark God had been using its legendary powers to generate Shadow Gates within the world of Magnamund, at locations and times of his own choosing. Such power had enabled him to send his loathsome champions to your home world while the force of the Gods of Good<ch.emdash/>Kai and Ishir<ch.emdash/>had been held at bay. Lone Wolf and the New Order Kai were all that stood against the onslaught of Naar<ch.apos/>s agents following the demise of the Darklords.</p>

     <p>Lone Wolf successfully escaped from the Plane of Darkness and returned to Sommerlund, yet he knew that the fight against Evil had not been won outright. He realized that he would have to return to the Plane of Darkness to retrieve the fabled Moonstone. Only by doing so would Magnamund truly be safe from an invasion by Naar<ch.apos/>s legions of darkness. Two years ago, with the aid of his most trusted ally, Lord Rimoah of Dessi, Lone Wolf fulfilled his vow by journeying to the Dark God<ch.apos/>s domain and retrieving the Moonstone of the Shianti. Upon his triumphant return, Lone Wolf placed the Moonstone in the Vault of the Sun<ch.emdash/>his personal chamber located deep below the fortified citadel of the Kai Monastery. He had hoped that the fabled artefact could remain there indefinitely, to be guarded by generations of Kai who would keep it secure from Naar<ch.apos/>s minions. Retrieval of the Moonstone had denied the Dark God<ch.apos/>s champions ready access to Magnamund, yet Lone Wolf knew that there were many lesser agents of Naar upon Magnamund waiting quietly in the shadows for the chance to do his evil bidding. Undoubtedly they would stop at nothing to retrieve the Moonstone for their foul master.</p>

     <p>Within a year of his return home it became clear to Lone Wolf that his wish could not be fulfilled. At first the presence of the Moonstone seemed greatly beneficial to Sommerlund. Crops grew abundantly, incidence of disease and illness became increasingly rare, and the newly-born were uniformly healthy. Even the offspring of the impoverished who, in normal times, could expect only one in three of their infants to survive longer than a month beyond birth, were all in good health and exceptional in their physical and mental development. The Sommlending called this extraordinary period of providence the <quote>Blessing of the Moonstone</quote>, yet this time of good fortune could not last. The power of the Moonstone is a great force for Good, but it is also greatly disruptive of the natural order of Magnamund. Soon death itself became a rarity in Sommerlund, and the four seasons of the year were slowly transformed into one unending spring. Lone Wolf was deeply troubled by the changes wrought by the Moonstone and sought the counsel of his closest friend<ch.emdash/>Guildmaster Banedon<ch.emdash/>leader of Sommerlund<ch.apos/>s Brotherhood of Magicians. Banedon entreated him to relinquish the Moonstone before the effects of its power became irreversible. To right the imbalance of nature the Moonstone would have to be taken to the Isle of Lorn, in the southernmost reaches of Magnamund, and delivered back into the hands of the Shianti. Only they, its creators, could prevent its powers from disrupting the natural order of your world.</p>

     <p>Lone Wolf agreed with Banedon<ch.emdash/>the Moonstone would have to be returned to the Shianti. The physical effects of its presence were beginning to attract the unwelcome attentions of those who secretly desire to enact Naar<ch.apos/>s revenge upon the Kai. When one of Naar<ch.apos/>s agents was captured by a Kai patrol within a few miles of the monastery, Lone Wolf felt he could wait no longer. He resolved to act immediately. Preparations were made for a long journey and, especially among the lower ranks of the Kai, rumours were rife that your leader would personally take responsibility for returning the Moonstone to the Shianti. Indeed, this speculation seemed to be confirmed as fact when it was discovered that Lone Wolf had secured the use of Guildmaster Banedon<ch.apos/>s famous flying ship<ch.emdash/><cite>Cloud-dancer</cite>.</p>

     <p>It therefore came as a shock when, early one morning, you were summoned unexpectedly to the Vault of the Sun. In strictest confidence, Supreme Master Lone Wolf informed you that he had decided to entrust you with the task of returning the Moonstone. His elaborate preparations were simply a diversion, a bluff designed to draw attention away from the vital mission that he wished you<ch.emdash/>the most talented and courageous of his five Kai Grand Masters<ch.emdash/>to undertake. It was with great pride and apprehension that you accepted the quest.</p>

     <p>Lone Wolf gave you the precious Moonstone in a seemingly ordinary satchel, yet the lining of this plain leather bag was woven from korlinium, a special mineral that would hide the Moonstone<ch.apos/>s powerful energies from the agents of Naar. In the guise of a Kai journeyman, you set sail from the Sommlending capital of Holmgard aboard a sailing ship that was to carry you south on the first leg of your journey, a voyage of 2,000 miles to Elzian, the capital of Dessi. This legendary city is home to Lord Rimoah and the Elder Magi. They are the last surviving members of Magnamund<ch.apos/>s oldest race of magicians and they had promised Lone Wolf that they would help you reach your final destination. You had hoped and expected the voyage to be swift and uneventful; however fate and ill fortune decreed otherwise. Your voyage was fraught with danger, yet you overcame the many perils ranged against you and eventually arrived at the Dessian capital, to the relief of Lord Rimoah and his anxious brother magicians who had feared the worst.</p>

     <p>For three days you were treated to the hospitality of the Elder Magi and the freedom of the wondrous city of Elzian. Then, on the morning of the fourth day, having fully recovered from the rigours of your journey to Dessi, you set out upon the final stage of your quest<ch.emdash/>the voyage to the Isle of Lorn. Passage had been arranged for you aboard a Suhnese trading ship called <cite>The Azan</cite>. The ship<ch.apos/>s master, Captain Jenkshi, had been paid handsomely to carry you to his home port of Suhn and you had been promised a swift and comfortable voyage. However, this was not to be. In the Shadakine city-port of Ghol-Tabras you fell foul of Sesketera, the city<ch.apos/>s ruthless ruler, and you were forced to abandon <cite>The Azan</cite> during your daring escape from his murderous bodyguards. After a perilous journey south by way of land and sea, you finally reached the Port of Suhn. There you made contact with Lord Zinair, the Dessian ambassador. He provided you with a small sailboat for your passage to the Isle of Lorn. This tiny island home of the Shianti lies no more than 200 miles east of the busy Port of Suhn, across the Sea of Dreams, yet no sailor has ever set eyes upon it for the Shianti have encircled their refuge with a web of enchantments, magical mists, and winds. Aided by the power of the Moonstone, you were able to navigate these mysterious waters and land upon the shores of Lorn.</p>

     <p>The Shianti had sensed the approach of the Moonstone and were waiting to greet your arrival. In a formal ceremony in the sacred Temple of Amida you received the thanks and praise of Acarya, the leader of the Shianti exiles. Solemnly, he vowed to deliver the Moonstone into the hands of Goddess Ishir herself, thereby ensuring that never again would its power disrupt Magnamund<ch.apos/>s delicate balance of nature, nor be misused by the forces of Evil.</p>

     <p>After the ceremony, the Shianti revealed to you some of the magical wonders of their island that have never before been seen by Man. You marvelled at flowing rivers of jewels, fabulous flora, and species of exotic fauna. After your tour of this paradise isle you were allowed to rest before being escorted to your sailboat to begin your journey back to the Port of Suhn.</p>

     <p>Your return voyage across the Sea of Dreams was swift and eerily smooth. You sensed that your direction and speed were being controlled by the Shianti, for within minutes of casting off from the shores of Lorn, the bustling harbour entrance to the Port of Suhn suddenly appeared from out of the swirling sea mist. A stiff breeze caught your sail and propelled you towards the quayside where Lord Zinair was waiting to greet your valiant return.</p>

     <p>Your journey from Suhn to the Isle of Lorn and back again seemed to have lasted no more than a few days. Yet, to your surprise, you discovered that two whole months had elapsed since the day you first sailed upon the Sea of Dreams. Lord Zinair praised you for the success of your quest. He also informed you that during the time you spent on Lorn a new and sinister threat to the fragile peace of Magnamund had arisen. The precise nature of this threat was revealed when you returned with Lord Zinair to his consulate.</p>

     <p>In a secret chamber of the Dessian consulate, you were able to communicate the success of your mission to Supreme Master Lone Wolf by means of a magical seeing stone. Warmly he praised the skill and courage you had displayed, and he commended you for upholding the highest traditions of the Kai. He told you that he and the New Order were justly proud of your accomplishment and they welcomed the day when you would return to the monastery. Lone Wolf also had some grave news to impart, news that would delay a swift return home.</p>

     <p><quote>King Oridon of Siyen has been assassinated,</quote> he said, sadly. <quote>His only son, Prince Karvas, is the sole heir to the throne of Siyen, but he has lived in exile on the Isle of Sheasu for the past decade. The Kingdom of Siyen is one of our oldest allies. Lord Xavial, the Siyenese High Chancellor, has journeyed here to the monastery to warn that, in the Prince<ch.apos/>s absence, the throne is to be claimed by Baron Sadanzo. The Baron is an evil man and he possesses a sorcerous power that has turned the minds of the Siyenese Court. He has won the favour of those who, until the King<ch.apos/>s murder, openly denounced him as a heartless warmonger. Lord Xavial fears that the Baron draws his newfound power from the Dark God himself, for never before has Sadanzo possessed such sinister influence. If Sadanzo becomes King, the consequence of his rule will be disastrous for us all. Siyen is one of the richest and most powerful realms in all the southern reaches of Magnamund. If it should fall into the hands of Naar, then war and widespread destruction will surely follow. This is grim news, but all is not yet lost<ch.ellips/>not if we act swiftly. The Constitution of Siyen decrees that Prince Karvas has, upon the death of his father, 60 days in which to lay claim to his rightful heritage. If he should fail to return in time then Sadanzo will be elected as the new ruler. I have vowed to Lord Xavial that the Kai will not stand idly by and let Siyen become enslaved by an agent of Naar. But time is against us<ch.emdash/>we must act immediately if we are to thwart Sadanzo<ch.apos/>s scheme. Ten days have already passed since King Oridon was murdered. Now only 50 days remain before Harvestmas Day<ch.emdash/>the day of royal ascendance.</quote></p>

     <p>You asked Lone Wolf how you could assist in keeping his pledge to Lord Xavial. His reply sent a shiver tingling down your spine.</p>

     <p><quote>Prince Karvas must be found. He must also be persuaded to return to Seroa, his homeland capital, to claim his throne before time runs out. You, Grand Master, are closer to the Isle of Sheasu than any other Kai. I must command you to go there and seek him out. Lord Zinair has already made provision for your journey by ship. He will accompany you and assist your mission. The Magicians<ch.apos/> Guild of Toran has also pledged its help. The Guildmaster has dispatched one of his brotherhood<ch.emdash/>Wizard Acraban<ch.emdash/>to Sheasu. He travels by skyship and should arrive there in twenty days<ch.apos/> time. You are to rendezvous with Wizard Acraban at the city of Mydnight<ch.emdash/>the island<ch.apos/>s only port. Acraban will help you find the Prince and transport him aboard his flying craft directly to Seroa.</quote></p>

     <p>With mixed feelings of pride and trepidation, you accepted the mission and vowed to Lone Wolf that you would do everything in your power to ensure its success. Your resolute promise met with his approval.</p>

     <p><quote>I have faith in you, Grand Master,</quote> he replied. <quote>The quest you are to undertake upholds the noblest traditions of the Kai. I am confident you will prevail. May Kai and Ishir guide you swiftly to victory over Sadanzo<ch.emdash/>an agent of Naar.</quote></p>

    <data>
     <p>You keep a record of your adventure on the <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
     <p>During the years you have spent in training at the Kai Monastery, you have devoted yourself to further developing your fighting prowess (<typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ>) and physical stamina (<typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ>). Before you begin this <cite>New Order</cite> adventure you need to measure how effective your training has been. To do this take a pencil and, with your eyes closed, point the blunt end of it onto the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a>. If you pick a 0 it counts as zero.</p>
     <p>The first number that you pick from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> in this way represents your <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ>. Add 25 to the number you picked and write the total in the <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> section of your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a> (i.e. if your pencil fell on the number 7 in the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> you would write in a <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> of 32). When you fight, your <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> will be pitted against that of your enemy. A high score in this section is therefore desirable.</p>
     <p>The second number that you pick from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> represents your powers of <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ>. Add 30 to this number and write the total in the <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> section of your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a> (i.e. if your pencil fell on the number 8 on the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> you would have 38 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points).</p>
     <p>If you are wounded in combat you will lose <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points. If at any time your <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points fall to zero or below, you are dead and the adventure is over. Lost <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points can be regained during the course of the adventure, but your number of <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points cannot rise above the number you have when you start an adventure.</p>
     <p>If you have successfully completed either of the previous adventures in the <cite>Lone Wolf New Order</cite> series (Books 21<ch.endash/>22), you can carry your current scores of <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> and <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points over to this adventure.<footref id="gamerulz-1" idref="gamerulz-1-foot"/> You may also carry over any Special Items, Kai Weapon, normal Weapons, and Backpack Items you had in your possession at the end of your last adventure, and these should be entered on your new <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
     <p><strong>Playing Tip:</strong> You may use a 10-sided die instead of the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> if you find it more convenient.</p>

       <p>It has long been the tradition of your <ch.eacute/>lite warrior caste to bestow a new name upon each young novice when they complete their first year<ch.apos/>s training at the Kai Monastery. Kai names are chosen by senior Kai Masters with the aim of reflecting the individual strengths and qualities of each novice.</p>
       <p>You may create your own Kai name for yourself, or you can generate a Kai name at random using the name tables below. To generate a Kai name, pick a number from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> and consult Table A. The name which corresponds to the number you have picked is the first part, or prefix, of your Kai name. Now pick a second number from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> and consult Table B. The name which corresponds to the number you have picked is the second part, or suffix, of your Kai name. Put the prefix and the suffix together and you have your own personal Kai name.</p>

         <p>After years of martial training and study at the Kai Monastery, and by the rigorous practice of the teachings of your illustrious mentor<ch.emdash/>Kai Supreme Master Lone Wolf<ch.emdash/>you have achieved the noble rank of Kai Grand Master Senior.</p>

         <p>Following in the footsteps of Lone Wolf himself, you have vowed that one day you will become totally proficient in all 16 of the New Order Kai Grand Master Disciplines.

         <p>If this is the first <cite>New Order</cite> adventure you have undertaken, then your present rank is that of Kai Grand Master Senior. This means that you have mastered <em>five</em> of the New Order Grand Master Disciplines listed below. It is for you to decide which five Disciplines these are. As all of the New Order Grand Master Disciplines may be of use to you at some point during your mission, pick these five skills with care. The correct use of a New Order Grand Master Discipline at the right time could save your life. When you have chosen your five Disciplines, enter them in the Grand Master Disciplines section of your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>.</p>

         <p>This Discipline enables a New Order Grand Master to manipulate the four basic elements: Earth, Air, Fire, and Water. By drawing upon individual elements that are available, or combinations thereof, he is able to detach, affix, increase, concentrate, intensify, remove, or accelerate this matter to fulfil a specific purpose, e.g. create a wall, hurl a rock, spray sand, remove air, intensify fire. The versatility of this Discipline increases as a New Order Grand Master advances in rank.</p>

         <p>Through mastery of this Discipline a Kai Grand Master of the New Order becomes a multi-talented performer, proficient in the use of any musical instrument. He is able to sing or chant, recite or compose tales of legend, mimic speech or dialect, and stimulate a wide range of emotions among sentient creatures. The effect and power of his bardic abilities will steadily increase as he advances through the Grand Master ranks.</p>

        <data>
         <p>Upon reaching the ultimate rank of Kai Supreme Master, Lone Wolf received as a reward from the God Kai many new skills and abilities. One of these skills was Kai Weaponcraft. Using his newfound mastery, Lone Wolf forged ten weapons of magical power in the armoury furnaces of the Kai Monastery. These magical weapons are reserved for the <ch.eacute/>lite of the New Order Kai who attain the rank of Grand Master.</p>

         <p>In recognition of your rank and achievement, you may choose your own Kai Weapon from the table below or, if you prefer, you can generate one at random. To generate a Kai Weapon, pick a number from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> and consult the first column. The magical Axe, Sword, or Broadsword which corresponds to the number you have picked will be your own personal Kai Weapon. Record this magical weapon and its unique properties in the Kai Weapon section of the <a idref="action">Special Items List</a>.<footref id="equipmnt-1" idref="equipmnt-1-foot"/></p>

         <p><strong>Example</strong></p>
         <p>Say you choose the number 8 from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a>, your Kai Weapon will be the Broadsword <quote>Illuminatus</quote>.</p>

         <p>When using this Kai Weapon in normal combat you may add <ch.plus/>5 points to your <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ>. Each Kai Weapon has a unique property. When you use your Kai Weapon in combat against the type of enemy that matches its unique property, or use it at the optimum time or location, then you may add the higher bonus to your <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> (these bonuses are not cumulative).</p>

         <p><strong>Example</strong></p>
         <p>If you were to use <quote>Illuminatus</quote> in combat against an enemy in an underground cavern, cave, or tunnel, you could add the higher bonus of 7 to your <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ>. If you were to fight this enemy in any other location, the bonus to your <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> would remain at 5.</p>

       <p>There will be occasions during your adventure when you will have to fight an enemy. The enemy<ch.apos/>s <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> and <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points are given in the text. Your aim in the combat is to kill the enemy by reducing his <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points to zero while losing as few <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points as possible yourself.</p>
       <p>At the start of a combat, enter your own and the enemy<ch.apos/>s <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points in the appropriate boxes on the Combat Record section of your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
       <p>The sequence for combat is as follows:</p>
       <ol class="paragraphed">
        <li><p>Add any extra points gained through your Grand Master Disciplines and Special Items to your current <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> total.</p></li>
        <li>
         <p>Subtract the <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> of your enemy from this total. The result is your Combat Ratio. Enter it on the <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
         <p>Example</p>
         <p>You, Grand Master (<typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> 32), are attacked in a forest by a pack of Wild Dogs (<typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> 31). You are taken by surprise and are not given the opportunity of evading their attack. You possess the Grand Master Discipline of Kai-surge to which the Wild Dogs are not immune, so you add 8 points to your <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ>. You also possess the Kai Weapon <quote>Ulnarias</quote>, so you add an additional 5 points to your <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ>. This gives you a total <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> of 45.</p>
         <p>You now subtract the Wild Dogs<ch.apos/> <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> from your own, giving a Combat Ratio of <ch.plus/>14 (45<ch.minus/>31=<ch.plus/>14). <ch.plus/>14 is noted on your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a> as the Combat Ratio.</p>
        </li>
        <li><p><a id="stage3">When you have your Combat Ratio</a>, pick a number from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a>.</p></li>
        <li>
         <p>Turn to the <a idref="crtable">Combat Results Table</a>. Along the top of the chart are shown the Combat Ratio numbers. Find the number that is the same as your Combat Ratio and cross-reference it with the random number that you have picked (the random numbers appear on the side of the chart). You now have the number of <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points lost by both yourself and your enemy in this round of combat. (E represents points lost by the enemy; GM represents points lost by yourself<ch.emdash/>Grand Master.)</p>
         <p>Example</p>
         <p>The Combat Ratio between you and the Wild Dogs has been established as <ch.plus/>14. If the number picked from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> is 1, then the result of the first round of combat is:</p>
         <ul>
          <li>You (GM) lose 3 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points (plus an additional 1 point for using Kai-surge. This loss is in addition to the loss suffered as a result of combat).</li>
          <li>Wild Dogs lose 9 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points.</li>
         </ul>
        </li>
        <li><p>On the <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>, mark the changes in <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points to the participants in the combat.</p></li>
        <li><p>Unless otherwise instructed, or unless you have an option to evade, the next round of combat now starts.</p></li>
        <li><p>Repeat the sequence from <a idref="stage3">Stage 3</a>.</p></li>
       </ol>

       <p>This process of combat continues until the <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points of either your enemy or yourself are reduced to zero or below, at which point that combatant is declared dead. If you are declared dead, the adventure is over. If the enemy is dead, you can proceed but with your <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points possibly reduced.</p>

         <p>During your adventure you may be given the chance to evade combat. If you have already engaged in a round of combat and decide to evade, calculate the combat for that round in the usual manner. All points lost by the enemy as a result of that round are ignored, and you make your escape. Only <strong>you</strong> may lose <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points during that round (such is the risk of turning tail and running away during combat!). You may only evade if the text of the particular section allows you to do so.</p>

        <data>
         <p>If you are a New Order Kai who has attained the rank of Kai Grand Master Superior, you will now benefit from improvements to the following Grand Master Disciplines:</p>
         <dl class="paragraphed">
          <dt>Animal Mastery</dt>
           <dd><p>Kai Grand Master Superiors who possess this Discipline are able to deter predatory animals in the wild by exuding a scent which is repellent to them. In order for this improved Discipline to work effectively, a Kai Grand Master Superior must be aware of the species of predatory animal he/she wishes to deter. The scent can only be detected by the targeted animal.</p></dd>
          <dt>Assimilance</dt>
           <dd><p>Kai Grand Master Superiors who possess this skill are able to create a noise and project it up to 15 yards away from their location. The noise is akin to the rumbling sound of thunder and it can be used to distract or divert an enemy<ch.apos/>s attention. This improved Discipline requires a degree of preparation and therefore it cannot be used during combat.</p></dd>
          <dt>Astrology</dt>
           <dd><p>Kai Grand Master Superiors who possess this Discipline are skilled in the use of all mechanical devices designed to measure and/or observe the cosmology of Magnamund. Such devices include sextants, astrolabes, and orreries.</p></dd>
          <dt>Herbmastery</dt>
           <dd><p>Kai Grand Master Superiors who have this Discipline are able to purify water, thereby making contaminated or briny water suitable for consumption. Roughly two pints of water per day can be purified using this skill alone. This daily total steadily increases as a Grand Master advances in rank.</p></dd>
          <dt>Elementalism</dt>
           <dd><p>Kai Grand Master Superiors who possess this skill are able to condense pure water out of the surrounding air. This water can be made to fall as a fine spray or as a sudden deluge. It can also be made to fill any suitable container or receptacle. Using this skill, Grand Master Superiors can create the equivalent of one large bucketful of fresh water.</p></dd>
          <dt>Bardsmanship</dt>
           <dd><p>Kai Grand Master Superiors who possess this Discipline are able to utilize their musical skills to pacify an excited or hostile animal.</p></dd>

         <p>If you are a New Order Kai who has attained the rank of Kai Grand Sentinel, you will now benefit from improvements to the following Grand Master Disciplines:</p>
         <dl class="paragraphed">
          <dt>Grand Weaponmastery</dt>
           <dd><p>Kai Grand Master Sentinels who possess this Discipline are, when physically parted from their Kai Weapon, able to detect its location. This power of detection will pass through solid objects, with the notable exception of lead. Accuracy and range of detection steadily increase as a Grand Master rises in rank.</p></dd>
          <dt>Grand Pathsmanship</dt>
           <dd><p>Kai Grand Sentinels who possess this skill are able to predict the weather accurately for the forthcoming 3 hours. The range of this ability is an area ten square miles around the Kai Grand Sentinel. Duration and range steadily increase as a Kai Grand Master rises in rank.</p></dd>
          <dt>Astrology</dt>
           <dd><p>Kai Grand Sentinels who possess this Discipline are able to detect psychic residues left on an object by its owner. The more valuable the object is to its owner, the stronger will be the lingering psychic attachment. The majority of everyday or shared objects do not retain such residues.</p></dd>
          <dt>Herbmastery</dt>
           <dd><p>Through their knowledge and use of common plants, Kai Grand Sentinels who have this Discipline are able to make contaminated or rotten food fit for human consumption.</p></dd>
          <dt>Elementalism</dt>
           <dd><p>Kai Grand Master Sentinels who possess this skill are able to charge particles of air electrically around any man-sized or smaller object. The particles will automatically discharge and cause damage should the affected object be touched or opened. Kai Grand Master Sentinels are able to handle a charged object without discharging it.</p></dd>
          <dt>Bardsmanship</dt>
           <dd><p>Kai Grand Master Sentinels who possess this Discipline are able to use their singing or playing to counter a hostile sonic attack. The effective use and range of this sonic defence steadily increase as a Grand Master rises in rank.</p></dd>

     <p>You are about to embark upon a vital mission to save the realm of Siyen from the clutches of the evil Baron Sadanzo and his robber knights. It is a noble quest and its success will bring great honour upon you and the Kai.</p>

     <p>Some of the material items that you will encounter during your quest will be of use to you, while others may be red herrings of no real value at all. If you discover items, be selective in what you choose to keep.</p>

     <p>Pick your five Grand Master Disciplines with care, for a wise choice will enable any player to complete the quest, no matter how weak their initial <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> and <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> scores may be. Completion of previous <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> adventures (Books 1<ch.endash/>22) may be advantageous, but it is not essential for the successful completion of this <cite>New Order</cite> adventure.</p>

     <p>May the light of the Gods Kai and Ishir guide you during your important quest.</p>

       <p>After a restless night spent contemplating the mission you have vowed to complete, you rise shortly before dawn and meet with Lord Zinair in the courtyard of the stables that adjoin the Dessian consulate. A horse-drawn carriage is waiting to take you both to the harbour where a sleek Suhnese clipper called <cite>The Azaktana</cite> is ready to set sail. This magnificent ship is one of the fastest vessels ever to have plied the southern seas, and Lord Zinair has commissioned it for your voyage to Sheasu. He and you will be the only passengers aboard.</p>
       <p><cite>The Azaktana</cite> is stocked with sufficient fresh water and provisions to enable her to complete the voyage without unnecessary delays. The weather is Zinair<ch.apos/>s main concern for the southern seas are notorious for the occurrence of sudden storms and squalls. Yet, despite his fears, the weather proves to be uncommonly mild. Aided by a strong easterly trade wind, the long voyage across the Mythenian and Vaduz seas is completed in record time.</p>
       <p>Shortly after sunset on the twentieth day of your voyage, the twinkling harbour lights of Mydnight are sighted by the lookout. The captain shouts an order and hurriedly his crew lower the sails to allow <cite>The Azaktana</cite> to glide silently into the harbour of Sheasu<ch.apos/>s solitary port. As the crewmen secure the ship to the quayside, the scudding clouds part and the decks are bathed by the ashen light of a full moon.</p>
       <p><quote>In thirty days<ch.apos/> time the moon will be full once more,</quote> says Lord Zinair, thoughtfully. <quote>It will then be the moon of Harvestmas. I pray that you and Prince Karvas shall be in Seroa to see that.</quote></p>
       <p>The parting clouds have also revealed a smaller globe of light in the night sky, above the port<ch.apos/>s eastern quarter. At first you assume it to be just a star, but when you magnify your vision you see it is the stern lantern of a flying ship which is hovering 100 feet above the rooftops.</p>
       <p><quote>See, there, my lord,</quote> you say, and point to the orb of light.</p>
       <p><quote>Ah, yes,</quote> replies Zinair, smiling. <quote>It would appear that Wizard Acraban has arrived before us.</quote></p>
       <p>Lord Zinair<ch.apos/>s pronouncement is proved to be correct when a young man, attired in the blue and silver robes of a Brotherhood magician, comes striding along the quayside towards your ship. He has a neatly trimmed beard and long, flowing ginger hair, and his chiselled features are distinctly Sommlending.</p>

       <p>You return to the jetty and show your tickets to the ticket seller. He grunts his approval and waves you aboard the riverboat. The number of your berth is written on your ticket, and you discover that you are both sharing cabin number 12 which is located at the stern. You are pleased to discover that it is one of the better cabins aboard. It has a cupboard stocked with food and wine, a washing bowl and a jug of water, and twin bunk beds with mattresses and feather pillows.</p>
       <p>After a short while you hear the <onomatopoeia>clang</onomatopoeia> of the riverboat<ch.apos/>s bell. It is a signal that the boat is about to set off for Seroa in five minutes<ch.apos/> time and a last call for passengers who are still in Xaia. Through the porthole of your cabin you can see the jetty and a queue of people boarding the boat. Fortunately, you do not see any Cavalians among them.</p>
       <p>Once everyone is aboard, the gangplank is raised and the riverboat<ch.apos/>s waterwheel begins to turn. As the boat gets underway, you lock the cabin door and settle down to a good night<ch.apos/>s sleep.</p>

       <p>You are shaken by the sudden impact of hitting the water, but you swiftly muster your senses and fight to stay astride your horse. Prince Karvas and his mount come crashing down nearby and, in a tangle of flailing limbs, you are all swept away by the river<ch.apos/>s irresistible current.</p>
       <p>You are sped along by the rushing water for more than three miles before you reach a stretch of shallows at a bend in the river.

Bruised and bedraggled, you stagger out of the water and collapse on the muddy shore, gasping for breath.</p>
       <p>When you fully recover, you find that you have lost 1 Weapon and 1 Backpack Item during your ordeal in the river. (Make the necessary adjustments to your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a><ch.emdash/>you may choose which Weapon and Backpack Item to erase.)</p>

       <p>Your skill and persistence finally pay off when the lock clicks open. You twist the iron door handle and push it open to reveal a circular stone staircase which leads all the way to the bell chamber at the top of the tower. On reaching the top you are treated to a spectacular view of the city. As you scan the rooftops and towers using your night vision, you are able to locate stables less than a mile away, to the north of the tower. You commit their location to memory and then hurriedly you descend the stairs to the antechamber below.</p>
       <p>As you close the tower door, your Kai senses alert you to a concealed panel in the wall opposite. You press this panel and it slides aside to reveal a secret cache of valuable items:</p>
       <ul>
        <li>100 Ren (equivalent to 10 Gold Crowns)</li>
        <li>Jewelled Knife</li>
        <li>Silver Signet Ring</li>
       </ul>
       <p>If you wish to keep any of the above, record them on your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a> as Backpack Items. (Ren is local currency which you may carry in your Belt Pouch.)</p>
       <p>On your return to the warehouse, Prince Karvas is delighted to hear that there are stables in Bakhasa and he insists that you set off for them at once. He is leading the way out of the ruins when suddenly the tower bell begins to toll once more. Moments later, the temple doors swing open and the procession of black-clad figures file out into the street. Instinctively you take hold of Karvas by the arm and pull him back into the ruins to avoid being seen by the emerging soldiers. As they pass by, you peer around the edge of the crumbling warehouse doorway to watch them. A strange feeling of unease makes the skin on the back of your neck prickle, and immediately you sense that all is not what it seems. When you magnify your vision to take a closer look at the passing figures, you gasp with shock at what you see.</p>

       <p>The searing flash of the lightning strike singes the skin on your face and hands (lose 3 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points), and leaves you blinded for a few moments. When your vision returns, you muster all of your Kai senses and focus them on the narrow strip of land which separates the fissures. Bolts of searing energy leap out of these chasms and soar past the skyship on either side to explode with thunderous cacophony among the roiling clouds. The crew cower with terror, but you maintain your nerve and let your Kai skills take full control of the wheel. After several nerve-racking miles the fissures eventually taper off and then disappear completely. As the <cite>Starstrider</cite> emerges from the gauntlet of deadly white fire, the crew gives a loud cheer in appreciation of your skilful helmsmanship. Gladly you acknowledge their praise, but you keep a grip on the helm for your Kai senses are screaming a warning that the danger is not yet over.</p>
       <p>You are five miles clear of the fissures when the steering becomes dangerously erratic. The <cite>Starstrider</cite> is losing altitude and her deck is beginning to tilt alarmingly to starboard. Soon it becomes almost impossible to stand upright. Acraban appears from below and struggles valiantly across the sloping deck to join you at the helm. The young sorcerer looks gaunt and exhausted, and his ginger hair is matted with grime and sweat. Clearly his efforts to repair the ailing skyship have severely drained his magical energies.</p>
       <p><quote>We have lost one stabilizer and the other is badly damaged,</quote> he says, grimly. <quote>I have done all I can to repair it but I fear it will fail at any moment. Without stabilizers we cannot stay airborne.</quote></p>
       <p>Acraban takes the helm and orders his crew to prepare for a crash landing. Some of the young men tie themselves to the ship<ch.apos/>s mast, while others brace themselves against the rails and put their fate in the hands of the Goddess Ishir. Prince Karvas has found refuge in a rope locker which is bolted to the main deck. He lifts the lid and calls for you to join him. There is sufficient space for two inside.</p>

       <p>The rock grazes your scalp (lose 1 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> point) and you almost fall from the saddle, but you manage to keep a tight hold of the reins and pull yourself upright.</p>
       <p>The speed and surefootedness of your Bhanarian stallions carry you and Karvas swiftly out of harm<ch.apos/>s way. You soon reach the rubble-strewn gate of the fortress and dismount to lead your horses inside. Within its crumbling walls there stands a keep, a cylindrical structure of time-worn masonry. The upper parts have collapsed leaving huge chunks of broken stone heaped around its base. Where once stood a gate of gleaming bronze, now only a blackened hole remains. It provides access to an inner hall and you enter to take shelter from the torrential rain.</p>
       <p>Engravings in the ceiling and walls of this derelict hall tell you that this fortress was once occupied by the Elder Magi. Both you and Karvas are fascinated by the intricate carvings and you decide to split up and explore this hall further. In an alcove at the north side you discover a shrine dedicated to the God Kai. Clumps of wild laumspur are growing around its base and you discover enough here for 3 potions. (Each Potion of Laumspur is a Backpack Item. It will restore 4 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points when swallowed after combat.)</p>
       <p>You are examining the shrine more closely when suddenly you hear Karvas scream out in alarm.</p>

       <p>You call upon your Magnakai Discipline of Psi-screen to protect your mind from this psychic attack. The pain in your head lessens, yet your protection does not extend to Prince Karvas who is now on the verge of unconsciousness. You bring your horse around and ride to his aid. As you draw alongside, you pull him upright in the saddle and then, using your Magnakai Curing skills, you are able to revive him to full consciousness (use of this skill costs you 2 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points).</p>
       <p>The terrible sound of the hunter<ch.apos/>s horn ceases abruptly and you hear them galloping towards you. Their leader is a broad-shouldered man with a ginger beard and long wavy hair. His hair fans out from around the edges of a conical helm that is topped by a pair of polished antlers. He brings his horse to a halt before you and Prince Karvas and he regards your mounts with an appraising eye.</p>

       <p>Karvas grabs your hand and pulls you to your feet. The drooling horror utters a chilling cackle and suddenly gathers speed. It has caught the enticing scent of horseflesh drifting on the chill night wind. You unsheathe your Kai Weapon and hurriedly move forward to block its approach to the narrow gully. You must now fight the creature.</p>

       <p>You follow Karvas through the teeming streets of the capital towards Palace Square, the grand plaza where the crowning ceremony is set to take place in less than an hour. A wide avenue of marbled stone leads towards the square, and as you hurry along it, you marvel at the aristocratic mansions and embassies that march past on either side. The sound of a fanfare echoes in the distance and you increase your pace when Karvas tells you that it signifies the arrival of Baron Sadanzo. The approach to the square itself is blocked by the crowd, but the Prince knows of another way by which you may reach it. You leave the avenue and he takes you along a narrow lane that winds through a maze of buildings in the Merchants<ch.apos/> Quarter. This area has been closed for the Ascendance and Harvestmas ceremonies, but you are able to climb over the barricades that have been erected to prevent entry by the crowd, and you reach the square unchallenged.</p>
       <p>On a raised platform in the centre of Palace Square, Baron Sadanzo is preparing to kneel before Phedros, the Marshal of the Realm, the highest ranking officer in the kingdom of Siyen. He is flanked by the High Chancellor, the High Chamberlain, the Mayor of Seroa, and other Siyenese noblemen. Under the Constitution of Siyen, following the death of Oridon and the absence of Karvas, the Marshal of the Realm is empowered to bestow kingship upon the Baron.</p>
       <p>Frantically, you and the Prince struggle through the crowd that encircles the platform. Phedros is about to place the State Crown of Siyen upon Sadanzo<ch.apos/>s head when you leap onto the platform and bring the ceremony to an abrupt halt.</p>
       <p><quote>I am Karvas, Crown Prince of Siyen, and I demand my birthright!</quote> shouts the Prince to the assembled nobles. The crowd gives a gasp of astonishment which is followed by a deathly hush.</p>
       <p><quote>You are an impostor,</quote> screams Sadanzo. <quote>The real Prince Karvas is exiled in Sheasu. I demand this man be executed for his insolence!</quote></p>
       <p>Marshal Phedros approaches Karvas and takes hold of his right arm. He pulls back the sleeve of his tunic and examines the birthmark on his wrist. Phedros has known Karvas since he was a baby, and you sense that he is convinced that the mark is genuine. He raises the Prince<ch.apos/>s arm so that the other Siyenese nobles gathered on the platform can see the crescent-shaped mark. Murmurs of dissent can be heard among the crowd, and whispers that Karvas has returned filter back to Sadanzo<ch.apos/>s ears. The evil Baron narrows his coal-black eyes and slips a glowing green gem from the pocket of his ermine robes. Your Sixth Sense warns you that this stone is radiating strong psychic energies. Through its use, Sadanzo is able to exert a powerful control over the noblemen of Siyen who are gathered here on the platform. If you are to break the Baron<ch.apos/>s mental hold over them, you must destroy the evil gem that is clenched in his bony fist.</p>

As the spell takes hold, you command him mentally to signal to his son that all is well between you.

It is said that he lives somewhere on the remote northern coast of Sheasu. He also tells you that Karvas is not alone. Shortly after he came here, almost a decade ago, he was joined by a young woman.

       <p>You gag and tie the unconscious guard with his belt and tunic, and then you hide him in some long grass at the base of the perimeter wall. Hurrying across the field, you soon reach a courtyard located near to the main entrance. This flagstoned yard abuts the entrance gates and is bounded on the other three sides by paddocks, tack rooms, and the training fields. There are only two guards on duty here, the others having been called upon to assist the patrols that are out searching the city. They are both asleep at their posts and you have no difficulty tiptoeing past them and entering the paddocks where the horses are stabled.</p>
       <p>You search the stalls and soon discover two black Bhanarian stallions of magnificent quality and breeding. They will make ideal mounts for you and Prince Karvas. These intelligent animals respond readily to your Magnakai Discipline of Animal Control and they remain calm and composed as you hurriedly fix their saddles and bridles. As you are leading them out into the courtyard, you stop to unbuckle a sword belt from the belly of a sleeping guard. Prince Karvas is unarmed and you are sure he will appreciate this weapon more than its present owner.</p>
       <p>You lead the horses across the courtyard and as you approach the stables<ch.apos/> main doors, you mount one of them and fix the reins of the other to your stirrup. Then you kick open one of the double doors and urge your horse forward at the gallop.</p>
       <p>The guards outside are taken completely by surprise. As they fumble to unsheathe their swords, you race across the square and wave to Karvas who is waiting patiently for your signal. The Prince leaps up from behind the cart and comes running towards the spare horse. He is getting ready to leap into its saddle when a gruff cry alerts you to danger. A patrol has entered the square and their officer is commanding his sergeant to fire at you with his bow.</p>

       <p>One of your pursuers suddenly emerges from the alleyway behind you, his steam-spear raised in readiness to launch another projectile. Instinctively, you dive at him and bring him crashing to the ground before he can release the deadly missile. In the ensuing struggle you knock him unconscious with a blow to his jaw; then you grab the hollow spear and turn it towards the Bakhasians gathered at the end of the street. A trigger lever on the side of the spear fires a projectile and you see it soar through the air to strike the nearest shrine-bearer squarely in the chest. As the man is hurled backwards by the force of its impact, his grip is torn from the platform. It tilts over and the tiger-head idol tumbles from its wooden base to hit the ground with a mighty crash. It shatters in two, releasing a whirling cone of red flame from its hollow core that swiftly engulfs the remaining bearers. In the blink of an eye these men are transformed into smouldering heaps of ash.</p>

Karvas becomes impatient with the man and he demands that you be allowed to leave.</p>
       <p><quote>I don<ch.apos/>t think you realize the trouble you<ch.apos/>re in,</quote> replies the Wharfmaster, testily. <quote>Travelling by riverboat without paying the fare is a custodial offence. The punishment is one day in gaol for every day travelled.</quote> The man opens his desk drawer and takes out a slim rod of opaque crystal. <quote>Now,</quote> he says, staring you straight in the eye, <quote>kindly tell me why you have no ticket.</quote></p>
       <p>You repeat the excuse you gave when you disembarked, that you must have lost your ticket during the voyage. The clear crystal sphere resting on his desk becomes milky white, and then its hue changes to crimson.</p>
       <p><quote>You<ch.apos/>re lying,</quote> says the Wharfmaster, and he touches you lightly on the hand with the tip of his slim rod. Suddenly a blinding white light flashes before your eyes and you feel yourself rapidly falling into unconsciousness.</p>

       <p>You rush into the small bakery and your sudden appearance startles the baker<ch.apos/>s wife. She gasps when she sees your soaked and slime-smeared features, and nervously she snatches up a knife and threatens to use it if either of you come a step closer. You can understand her reaction; after your dip in the citadel moat, you and Karvas look more reptilian than human.</p>
       <p><quote>Calm yourself, good lady,</quote> you say, in as soothing a tone as you are able to muster. <quote>My companion and I may appear a little wretched but we mean you no harm.</quote> The woman is not convinced. She raises the knife in her trembling hand and begins shouting hysterically for her husband. Moments later, a portly man in a white smock and cloth hat emerges from an open doorway at the rear of the shop. He is brandishing an iron skillet and comes at you like a charging bull.</p>
       <p><quote>Hold there, Barwick!</quote> shouts Karvas, and to your astonishment the baker skids to a halt and drops his iron pot to the floor.</p>
       <p><quote>Prince Karvas<ch.ellips/>is it you?</quote> he stammers. Karvas uses his sleeve to wipe some of the slime from his face, and then he gives the baker a broad smile.</p>
       <p><quote>Yes, Barwick, it is I.</quote></p>
       <p><quote>Thank Ishir,</quote> gasps the baker, and he falls to his knees. <quote>We have prayed that you would return home and save us from Sadanzo. We of Cavalia have suffered his tyranny for too long. He is an evil man and we fear that he will bring ruin to Siyen when he is crowned king. But now our Prince has returned to stop him. Ishir be praised!</quote></p>
       <p>The sound of horses galloping to a halt outside the bakery alerts you to the fact that you and the Prince are still in great danger. The baker bolts the door and then urges you and Karvas to follow him as he hurries out of the shop, past his baking ovens, and through a rear door that leads to a walled yard scattered with chickens. He pulls open the door of an outbuilding and he offers you and Karvas the two young horses that are stabled inside. They are his most valuable animals and Karvas is impressed by the man<ch.apos/>s generosity.</p>
       <p><quote>I<ch.apos/>ll not forget this, Barwick,</quote> says Karvas, as you and he quickly saddle the two colts. The baker pulls open one of a pair of gates at the rear of his yard. Proudly he salutes you as you steer your horses through the gap and gallop away along a passageway that leads to one of Cavalia<ch.apos/>s city streets.</p>

Menacingly he levels this glowing rod at your face and very slowly he moves towards you. Hurriedly you apologize to the blacksmith and leave the smithy.</p>
       <p>On returning to the quayside you resolve to explore the tangle of alleyways that make up the city<ch.apos/>s eastern quarter in the hope of finding someone who is more willing to talk about the Prince. Unfortunately, your efforts garner no useful information. As the sun begins to settle on the horizon, you finally abandon your search and hurry back through the darkening passageways towards the market square.</p>
       <p>Wizard Acraban and Lord Zinair are already waiting aboard the <cite>Starstrider</cite> by the time you reach the market square. The magician orders the boarding cage to be lowered and you are winched up to the skyship. They are disappointed to hear that your search for information has been in vain. Fortunately, Lord Zinair<ch.apos/>s efforts have been more fruitful.</p>
       <p><quote>Prince Karvas is not here,</quote> he says. <quote>He lived here when he first came to Sheasu some ten years ago, but a young woman called Amarelda arrived soon after and they were married, here, in the harbour. They left Mydnight the day after their wedding and settled somewhere on the northern coastline. It has been more than a year since they last visited the city.</quote></p>
       <p>Turning to Acraban, Zinair says: <quote>I propose we travel north at first light and commence a search of the northern shoreline. I suspect it will be easier to espy their retreat from the air than to attempt any search by land.</quote></p>
       <p>Acraban nods in agreement. Then he passes word to his young crew to prepare the <cite>Starstrider</cite> for a voyage north at first light.</p>

       <p>The farmer seems bemused by your refusal. His fee is very reasonable, especially when compared to the charge you would be expected to pay for crossing the river at the Voshno Bridge. When he tells you that there are no other river crossings for 30 miles in either direction, you ask if he would accept something other than cash in return for the use of his raft. After a few moments<ch.apos/> thought, he says that he would accept either 1 Weapon or 1 Backpack Item.</p>
       <p>If you possess sufficient cash, you can still pay the farmer a fee of 8 Lune, or 2 Gold Crowns. If you do not have enough money, you must give him either 1 Weapon or 1 Backpack Item of your choice. (Make the appropriate changes to your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>.)</p>
       <p>The farmer ferries you and your horse across the river, and then he goes back to collect Karvas and his mount. Once the Prince is safely across, you bid the cheerful man farewell and ride away from the river, heading east. You notice that Prince Karvas is smiling as he rides across this lush river valley and you ask him why he is so happy. He explains that the Ioma is the political boundary between the realms of Lunarlia and Siyen, and having crossed the river you are now on Siyenese soil. After ten years in exile he has, at last, returned to his homeland.</p>
       <p>Dusk is turning to darkness when you come to a road that traverses the plain to the east of Voshno. Your horses are tired and so you decide to camp for the night in a small wood that borders this road. Before you rest, you must eat a Meal or lose 3 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points (unless you possess the Discipline of Grand Huntmastery).</p>

       <p>You tug on the reins and swivel in the saddle to avoid the onrushing shaft. Your speedy reactions save you from being struck in the body, yet the arrow tears a strip of skin and muscle from your shoulder before it shatters into the ground: lose 3 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points.</p>
       <p>Karvas leaps onto his horse and you toss him the reins. With a cry of elation, you wheel your stallion about and spur him towards an avenue on the west side of the square. You and the Prince gallop side by side along this broad thoroughfare as fast as your horses will carry you, trampling any Bakhasian who is foolish enough to stand in your way. The road leads directly to the city<ch.apos/>s east gate where a bell is tolling loudly. A crowd of militiamen have gathered at the gate, summoned from their beds by the alarm, but they are without their officer and in the chaos and confusion they have forgotten to close the gate. They scatter in all directions as you thunder along the avenue towards them and you are able to escape through the open archway without challenge.</p>
       <p>Whooping with excitement, you race away from Bakhasa along a dusty trail that heads towards the foothills of the Dammerdon Mountains. You glance to your side and see Prince Karvas punch the air victoriously. Clearly he is as excited by this daring escape as you are, for there is a grin fixed to his sweat-streaked face that stretches from ear to ear.</p>
       <p>Your strong Bhanarian stallions carry you swiftly into the foothills and never once do they falter in their stride nor slacken their impressive pace. Only when you can no longer see the lights of Bakhasa do you let them slow to a canter. For more than an hour you travel the trail as it meanders through pine-covered hills and shallow valleys. The night sky is clear and the way ahead is illuminated by bright starlight. When you come to a shallow ford across a fast-flowing stream, you stop here awhile to let your horses drink their fill.</p>

       <p>The Cavalians laugh and sneer at Prince Karvas<ch.apos/> accusation. <quote>Watch your tongue, journeyman,</quote> retorts their leader, a scar-faced sergeant with a shaved head. <quote>We Siyenese don<ch.apos/>t take kindly to Northland troublemakers.</quote> Another of the group calls out to the tavern-keeper, demanding that he come and throw you out.

       <p>You are about to enter when suddenly you notice the body of a young boy lying partially buried beneath a heap of straw. By the colour and cut of his clothing, you recognize the body to be that of the stable boy who took charge of your horses when you first arrived here. Swiftly you unsheathe your Kai Weapon as you enter the stables. Your caution is justified, for as soon as you pass through the stable door, you are attacked by six Cavalian bandits who have been lying in wait for you and Karvas to appear.</p>

       <p>The rolling plain to the west of Bakhasa is a bleak and barren steppe, devoid of flora yet studded with countless thousands of sawn-off tree stumps. Once this region was part of the Great Forest of Kelderwood, but in recent times the ruler of Bhanar, Autarch Sejanoz, has commanded the Bakhasians to harvest the forest<ch.apos/>s valuable hardwood and dispatch it downstream to feed the insatiable needs of the imperial shipyards of Otavai. Travelling on foot, the stumps do not obstruct your progress and you are able to press on until late in the afternoon. As you are cresting a ridge of high ground, you spot a troop of horsemen escorting a line of wagons laden with timber. They are less than a mile distant and they appear to be heading towards a settlement on the banks of the River Tehda. You wait and watch them until they are dots on the horizon before continuing your trek towards the city of Bakhasa.</p>
       <p>You are within 20 miles of Bakhasa when dusk begins to darken the gloomy sky. Karvas requests that you stop to rest awhile before making a final push for the city. You are feeling hungry after your long day<ch.apos/>s march and you agree readily. (Unless you possess the Discipline of Grand Huntmastery, you must now eat a Meal or lose 3 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points.) You are about to resume your trek when your Kai Sixth Sense alerts you to the sound of approaching horses and wagons. You are scanning the surrounding hills when suddenly a dozen riders appear from behind a ridge to the north. They are escorting two wagons filled with sleepy timber workers returning to their settlement after a day<ch.apos/>s labour. You signal to Karvas to hide himself as they approach along a cleared trail which passes within 20 yards of your position. The horsemen canter past ahead of the wagons, but one of the riders who is following behind suddenly leaves the track and steers his horse through the stumps towards your position. Fearing that you may have been spotted, you signal to Prince Karvas to split up and find a new hiding place. Silently you watch as the horseman is slowed to a halt by a dense cluster of tree stumps. He dismounts and abandons his mare in order to continue his search on foot. He draws his sword as he passes close to where you are hiding, but he does not see you. As he moves away, you see that his horse does not follow. She stays to crop some sickly weeds at the base of a tree stump barely 10 yards from where you are lying. Hanging from her saddle are a bulging leather satchel, an axe, and a coil of rope.</p>

       <p>The Marshal of the Guard orders his men to confiscate all of your Weapons and equipment. Then he marches you and Karvas under close escort to the cells below the main hall, where you are shackled to the wall in irons. Karvas is shocked by this brutal treatment and he cannot fathom a reason why Lodamos would treat you both this way.</p>
       <p>An hour passes before the door to the cell is thrown open and in strides Baron Lodamos, escorted by a bodyguard of his toughest men-at-arms. Prince Karvas pleads for your immediate release, but his pleas fall on deaf ears.</p>
       <p><quote>Do you not recognize me, my lord?</quote> he asks. <quote>Do you not remember the days we spent hunting wild boar in the Ioma Forest?</quote></p>
       <p><quote>The resemblance is uncanny, I grant you that,</quote> replies Lodamos, <quote>but you are another impostor, another of Sadanzo<ch.apos/>s sorcerous creations sent here to assassinate me.</quote></p>
       <p>The Baron holds up the Stone Dagger that was found in your Backpack. <quote>You have a persuasive tongue,</quote> he says, <quote>but here I hold proof that you are assassins. This evil blade is the instrument with which you intended to slay me. See, it is already stained with the blood of those you have slain before. No goodly men would carry such a weapon for their own defence.</quote></p>
       <p>Desperately you try to explain how the Stone Dagger came into your possession, how you discovered it in the hut in the Dammerdon Mountains. Unfortunately your hurried explanation does little to help. Baron Lodamos has already made up his mind that you are assassins in the pay of Baron Sadanzo, sent here to murder him, and he will not be convinced otherwise.</p>
       <p>The Baron turns to the sergeant of his bodyguard and orders him to have his men prepare their weapons. A cold shiver runs down your spine when you see that these men-at-arms are equipped with crossbows that are cocked and loaded, ready to fire. The sergeant gives the order. The guards raise their bows and take aim. Prince Karvas begs the Baron to reconsider but it is now too late. Lodamos hurls the Stone Dagger to the floor, smashing it to pieces, and then he spins on his heel and strides out of the cell without looking back. With a grunt, his sergeant gives the order to fire and his men release their volley of deadly missiles. Death is mercifully swift.</p>

       <p>It is a difficult struggle to keep the <cite>Starstrider</cite> on a straight and level course for she veers continually towards starboard. To counter this persistent drift you pull the wheel hard to port, yet the effects of her damaged stabilizer are unpredictable, making it almost impossible for you to maintain any sure control of the helm. In desperation, you muster all of your Kai senses and focus them on the narrow strip of land which separates the fissures. Bolts of searing energy leap out of these chasms and soar past the skyship on either side to explode with thunderous cacophony among the roiling clouds. The crew cower with terror, but you keep your nerve and let your Kai skills take full control of the wheel. After several nerve-racking miles the fissures eventually taper off and then disappear completely.</p>
       <p>As the <cite>Starstrider</cite> emerges from the gauntlet of deadly white fire, the crew gives a loud cheer in appreciation of your skilful helmsmanship. Gladly you acknowledge their praise, but you maintain your grip of the helm for your Kai senses are screaming a warning that the danger has not yet passed.</p>

       <p>Beyond the arch is a narrow brick walkway which borders the river. You hurry along this unlit footpath until you come to a flight of steps that leads to a flagstoned loading area crowded with soldiers and wagons. By keeping low and moving from one wagon to the next, you and Karvas are able to cross this busy concourse undetected.</p>
       <p>Soon you come to a stone bridge that traverses the River Tehda. You hurry across it and enter a wide avenue which leads to the city<ch.apos/>s east quarter. Grimy two-storey houses of carved hardwood pass by on either side, silent behind their bolts and shutters. At the end of the avenue you almost collide with a patrol of armed guards which is marching towards the river, and hurriedly you are forced to take cover in a timber yard to avoid being seen. You watch the ten-strong patrol as it marches past, and note that these men are clad in black quilted tunics with wide silk leggings, and they are armed with curved swords and hand-axes. They are almond-eyed and they all have shiny black hair tied in a knot at the nape of their necks. Their leader, a stocky bull-necked sergeant, wears the emblem of Sejanoz emblazoned upon a scarlet armband. Patiently you wait for them to reach the river but, when they do, you see another patrol come marching along the avenue from the opposite direction. The east quarter of Bakhasa is a bustling place, even at this late hour. Rather than risk being seen and captured, you decide to remain hidden here in the timber yard and attempt to get a few hours<ch.apos/> sleep before dawn.</p>

       <p>It is early morning when you awaken. Your sleep has revived your strength (restore 3 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points) and left you feeling in good spirits. You wake Karvas and then you both go up on deck to enjoy the warm sunshine and watch the passing countryside. To the west, the left bank is backed by farmsteads and orchards; to the east, the ground gently rises to low, rolling, vine-clad hills. The Sero is deep, and its fast-flowing current helps propel the boat downstream at a quicker rate than could be maintained by a horse. On reflection, you are glad that you decided to travel to Seroa by this route.</p>

       <p>The riverboat is crowded with passengers bound for the capital. From snatches of conversations that you overhear on deck, you learn that most of them are going there to see the crowning of Sadanzo. Many of your fellow travellers stand to gain in some way from his ascendance, and when you discover this fact, you and Karvas take care to avoid them as much as possible.</p>
       <p>As darkness falls, the passengers congregate on a lower deck of the boat which serves as a gambling hall. You and Karvas remain at the rail and enjoy the sight of a waxing moon that dominates the clear night sky. <quote>Tomorrow will be Harvestmas Day and the moon will be at its fullest,</quote> says Karvas, wistfully.</p>
       <p><quote>Yes,</quote> you reply, <quote>and you, my lord, shall by then be rightful king of this realm.</quote></p>
       <p>You leave the rail and retire to sleep, waking early the following morning with mixed feelings of excitement and apprehension. The riverboat comes within sight of Seroa by mid-morning and docks at the city<ch.apos/>s wharf one hour before noon. You and Karvas are jostled by the other passengers as you wait on deck, for everyone is eager to disembark and hurry to Palace Square in time to see the crowning ceremony. When your turn comes to leave the riverboat, you see that the passengers ahead of you are being stopped at the end of the gangplank by two Seroan City Guardsmen. They are collecting their riverboat tickets.</p>

       <p>The town of Jaroc has little to entice you to stay here any longer. The weather has steadily improved since you left the Dammerdon Mountains and so you resolve to try to make up for the time that was lost to the storm.</p>
       <p>You leave the town and for the next two days you ride in a northeasterly direction, across a rich expanse of rolling prairie. The riding is easy and the fine weather helps you make good progress. By noon of the third day you have covered nearly 200 miles and you are feeling in good spirits. The prairie gradually gives way to a region of hilly uplands that lie sandwiched between two mountain ranges. Here you happen upon a rutted track that leaves the prairie and winds through the hills through a high pass. There are no signposts on this road, but Karvas is familiar with this region and he tells you that it leads to an outpost town called Battle Pass. You are in the land of Lunarlia and for centuries this realm has been the enemy of Siyen<ch.emdash/>Prince Karvas<ch.apos/> homeland. Many wars have been waged between the two kingdoms and this region has seen countless battles. Karvas pledges to end these wars. When he is crowned King of Siyen he vows that he will seek a lasting peace with the kingdom of Lunarlia.</p>
       <p>It is noon and a warm sun is beating down on the fortified town of Battle Pass as you approach its west gate. Karvas is grateful that he is wearing the clothes of a Sommlending journeyman, for the inhabitants of this tough frontier post are notoriously hostile to the Siyenese. To your surprise, the guards at the gate pay you scant attention and you are allowed to enter the town with little more than a cursory glance. You ask Karvas why this is so and he tells you that riders approaching from the west, the Lunarlian side, are allowed to pass freely. Riders from the east, the Siyenese side, are subjected to far greater scrutiny.</p>
       <p>Beyond the west gate a broad avenue opens out into a main square that is bordered by a trading post, a barracks, and a tavern. Both you and Karvas are especially thirsty after your ride through the dry, dusty hills, and you are eager to seek out some refreshment.</p>

       <p>Having decided the places where each of you will search for the whereabouts of Price Karvas, you follow Acraban to the rear deck and enter the skyship<ch.apos/>s boarding cage. Swiftly it is winched down to the market square where you are met unexpectedly by a pressing crowd of grimy-faced street urchins. They have been gathering here since dawn to stare in wonderment at the <cite>Starstrider</cite> hovering motionless in the cloudless sky above. Acraban scatters a handful of copper coins across the cobblestones and the children scramble to retrieve them. This creates enough space to allow Zinair to open the cage door and the three of you to step out. After agreeing to return to the skyship no later than sunset, you split up and go in search of your chosen destinations.</p>
       <p>Unlike the urchins, the adult population of Mydnight appears less than fascinated by the imposing sight of the <cite>Starstrider</cite> hovering above their city. Few give it a second glance. This seeming lack of interest does not surprise you. For centuries this port has been a refuge for exiles from the many nations of Magnamund who, for their own individual reasons, have chosen to forsake their native lands. They are, by nature, a secretive community. Any overt interest in the affairs of another is often viewed with suspicion and distrust. You retrace the route you took last night and soon find yourself at the harbour. <cite>The Azaktana</cite> is still moored at the quayside and you give the crew a friendly wave as you stride along the harbour wall towards the city<ch.apos/>s south quarter.</p>
       <p>You have no difficulty finding Grosta<ch.apos/>s Warehouse; this weather-beaten emporium occupies most of the waterfront. Its main entrance is guarded by two muscular, sallow-faced Mythenians who wear long, silky black moustaches. Reluctantly they move aside to allow you into the warehouse. Inside you are greeted by a bald, pot-bellied man with a thin smile. He wipes his hands on his striped apron and enquires how he may be of service. When you ask if he knows where you can find Prince Karvas of Siyen his smile quickly transforms into a scowl of suspicion and he takes a few shuffling steps backwards. Your Kai Sixth Sense tells you that he suspects you to be an assassin who has come here to Mydnight to find and murder the Prince. Nervously he glances at the two Mythenians guarding the door. You realize you must act quickly if you wish to allay his fears and avoid a confrontation with his men.</p>

       <p>Acraban repeats his order to Kuo the helmsman to reverse the descent and change course, thirty degrees to port. The bow of the <cite>Starstrider</cite> rises up and the deck banks gently over to the left. But then another deafening <onomatopoeia>Crack!</onomatopoeia> explodes from somewhere below the stern, and you are thrown onto your hands and knees when a violent shock wave ripples along the decking. Acraban calls for a damage report and each crewman shouts his response in turn. The <cite>Starstrider</cite> has sustained a glancing blow from an energy bolt. It has torn away part of the hull plating and damaged one of the ship<ch.apos/>s two internal stabilizers, upon which it relies for level flight. The craft ceases to gain height and begins drifting to starboard. This change of course is accompanied by a jarring vibration that runs through the deck and superstructure.</p>
       <p>The surrounding sky is now a seething mass of billowing black clouds lit up by lethal blue-white bolts of lightning. The ship passes through a dark cloud and the metallic stench of ozone fills your nostrils. This harsh-smelling gas does you no harm, protected as you are by your innate Magnakai skill of Nexus. Likewise, Acraban suffers no ill effects from the gas for his magic is sufficient to counter it. But for Prince Karvas and the crew its effects are immediate and devastating. Clutching at their throats they lose their balance and fall to the deck, choking and spluttering as they fight for breath. Acraban instructs you to take the helm while he goes below to work on the damaged stabilizer. You follow his command and take control of the wheel from a barely-conscious Kuo. As the cloud passes the crew slowly recover, but you glimpse a fresh danger ahead. The <cite>Starstrider</cite> is drifting towards two large active fissures running parallel to each other, and a little over 100 feet apart. Sweat streaks your face as you struggle to steer a straight course between these fissures and so avoid the crackling bolts of energy that are hurtling out of their fiery depths.</p>

       <p>You enter the sleepy hamlet of Voshno and ride along its main street, past rows of dusty shops and gabled houses. You come to a market square. The villagers here are a sullen, silent crowd. Few pay you more than the scantest attention as they go about their evening chores. To the east of the square you can see a paved avenue called Shaney Street that leads down to the river. An arch of pale pink stone stands at the entrance to the Voshno Bridge, its surface pitted and scarred with lasting reminders of desperate battles fought here during wars past.</p>
       <p>You recall the advice given you freely by the man called Daventi when you visited the Oridon Stone. He said that the bridge at Voshno has been seized by robber knights from Cavalia and they are demanding a heavy toll from anyone seeking to use it. You tell Karvas this and he says that you should avoid the bridge and continue north along the trail.</p>
       <p>Three miles out of Voshno you see a small farmstead at the river<ch.apos/>s edge. It has a water-mill and its wheel is turning slowly, grinding the farmer<ch.apos/>s corn. Beside the mill you notice a raft moored to a wooden jetty. The farmer is in an adjoining field and he waves as you ride nearer. You stop to ask if he would kindly ferry you and your horses across to the other side of the river.</p>

As you scramble to your feet, he points to the sky and you glimpse the dark outline of a flying creature circling above the ledge. Its cries have startled the horses and hurriedly you attempt to calm them for fear that they will bolt and run. Twice the creature circles around the ledge before it swoops down to land on the trail. It folds its wings behind its pallid body and you see that its torso is lean and sinewy and studded with hundreds of horny spikes. Bubbling drool runs from its dangled jaw and its eye-slits emit a cold, yellowy light. Slowly it creeps towards your shelter and suddenly you sense its purpose. This ghastly being is diseased and starving; it is desperate for food and its sole desire is to feast upon the flesh of your horses.</p>

       <p>Karvas rises from among the tree stumps and hurries back to join you. Together you watch the departing wagons and horsemen until they are no more than dots on the horizon before you continue your trek towards the city of Bakhasa.</p>
       <p>Night falls within an hour of you resuming your trek, yet the distant lights of Bakhasa and its surrounding settlements enable you to stay on course and maintain an impressive pace. The city is lit by hundreds of fiery beacons which mark the outline of its ancient perimeter wall and angular watchtowers. These fires also illuminate the surface of the River Tehda which passes through the centre of Bakhasa. To the south of the city, lines of tethered barges stacked high with logs lie moored along both of its paved banks. Under cover of the night, you are able to move through the outlying settlements without being seen. When at last you hear a bell in the city tolling the midnight hour, you find yourself upon a knoll overlooking a rutted road which approaches Bakhasa<ch.apos/>s west gate. Using your night vision, you scan the high perimeter wall and note the positions of guards posted around its tiled parapet. They are greatest in number above a wide stone archway where the glimmering river flows out of the city. Prince Karvas is eager to enter the city before dawn and he asks you to choose the way. Aware that it may prove easier to find and take some horses while most of Bakhasa<ch.apos/>s inhabitants are still asleep, you scan the perimeter wall once more and consider how best you can pass beyond it.</p>

       <p>It has been dark for more than two hours and your horses are close to exhaustion when finally you glimpse the city of Varedo, standing like a beacon of hope upon the northern edge of the Lucien Plain. Its towers and turrets and strong perimeter wall are constructed of a bleached white stone that glimmers eerily in the moonlight. Prince Karvas is glad to have left the province of Cavalia behind and he is hopeful that your reception in Varedo will be a more cordial one. The city, and its surrounding region, have always been loyal to the House of Oridon. Its ruler, Baron Lodamos, was a friend and martial advisor to his father, King Oridon. Karvas cannot imagine that Lodamos would ever join forces with Sadanzo whom he has always openly despised.</p>
       <p>As you approach the city gate, you see that the blue flags of Varedo are flying at half-mast. This sight reassures Karvas, for it tells him that the city is still mourning the passing of his father. If Lodamos had joined with Sadanzo there would be no such display of respect for the memory of the king. At first the guards refuse you entry for the gates of Varedo are kept secure during the hours of nightfall. But when Karvas demands to see Guard Captain Dunwayne, the matter is quickly resolved. Karvas and Dunwayne both attended the military academy of Seroa, where they spent seven years together learning the art of soldiering. During this time they became the best of friends. Only when Karvas was forced into exile in distant Sheasu did their friendship lapse. The Prince is delighted to hear that Dunwayne still commands the city guard of Varedo and he awaits his arrival with keen anticipation. When eventually Dunwayne arrives at the gatehouse, theirs is a heart-warming reunion. Karvas quickly tells the guard captain of your need to reach Seroa as swiftly as you are able, and Dunwayne pledges to do all he can to help you. He provides you with fresh horses and escorts you personally through the lamplit streets of the city to the citadel where Baron Lodamos resides. Using his rank and influence, Dunwayne is able to rouse Chamberlain Gant, the Baron<ch.apos/>s aide. Gant can scarcely believe his eyes when he comes to meet Karvas. He has his guards escort you to the main hall of the citadel while he goes to wake the Baron and tell him the news. Karvas bids Dunwayne goodnight, for the guard captain must now return to his duties at the perimeter wall, but they agree to meet again soon, once Karvas has been crowned King.</p>
       <p>The Chamberlain<ch.apos/>s guards leave you to wait for Baron Lodamos in the main hall. You spend the passing minutes admiring the many regal portraits which hang around its marble walls. They depict the kings of Siyen, and Karvas muses aloud that one day his own portrait will hang there. Then you hear the tramp of marching feet approaching the closed doors of the hall, and you and Karvas stand to attention in readiness to meet Baron Lodamos. But when the great doors swing open, it is not Lodamos who stands before you. It is a unit of armoured soldiers led by a grim-faced Marshal of the Guard.</p>

       <p>Your warning brings Acraban to an immediate halt, yet it comes just seconds too late for he has already stepped upon the edge of the covered pit. There is a loud <onomatopoeia>crack</onomatopoeia> of splintering wood and the young magician yelps with alarm as he drops feet-first through the branches which camouflage this trap.</p>
       <p>Fearing the worst, you rush forward to help him. Suddenly he rises out of the pit before you, lifted up by a hastily-cast <spell>Levitation</spell> spell. His magical skill and swift reactions have saved him from being impaled upon the sharpened stakes which line the walls and base of this deadly trap. But he has not escaped the stakes unscathed: he has suffered deep gashes to his legs and feet.</p>
       <p>Using your Kai healing skills, you tend to the magician<ch.apos/>s wounds and restore him to health. The effort required to do this costs you 3 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points.

       <p>Early next morning, shortly before dawn, you meet with Karvas and Sainus and go to collect your horses from the stable. As you mount them, the old man bids you good luck and he gives the Prince a pouch containing 50 Orla, a sum that could prove useful during the journey to Seroa.</p>
       <p>Dawn breaks as you leave Sainus<ch.apos/> house, and you hear a bell which signifies that the night curfew has now come to an end. You ride along the waking streets of the north quarter and enter a broad avenue that leads directly to the east gatehouse. The guards posted here are opening the great east gate as you approach, and you gallop through the widening gap and out onto the plain beyond.</p>
       <p>The sun shines brightly all day and you make good progress along the trail that heads due east towards the River Sero. By nightfall you have covered more than 75 miles and have reached the tiny village of Xaia. Moored at its wooden jetty is a large riverboat. This grand vessel is brightly illuminated by hundreds of coloured lanterns that are fixed to its masts and deck rails. You tether your horses to a post and then hurry along the jetty to where a thin man in a long black coat is seated at a table. He is counting out Orla and stacking them neatly in piles of twenty. Karvas asks if he may purchase two tickets to Seroa, but the man shakes his head and tells you that all the tickets have been sold. The riverboat sails within the hour and every place aboard has been purchased.</p>

       <p>You wheel your horse about and tug your Kai Weapon from its scabbard. Karvas catches up with you and he brings his stallion around to stand by your side. The pursuing Bakhasians have slowed to a halt less than 100 feet back along the trail, and their leader is shouting and shaking his fist at you triumphantly. You hear his coarse laughter and you watch with mounting dread as his staff grows in length and tapers to a point at one end. In a matter of seconds it is no longer a staff: it has become a heavy jousting lance. The armour-clad leader bellows a challenge, demanding that you face him in personal combat. With your only route of escape cut off by the burning tree, you accept his challenge. You raise your weapon and shout your battle-cry<ch.emdash/><quote>For Sommerlund and the Kai!</quote><ch.emdash/>as you spur your horse towards your cackling foe.</p>

The knight<ch.apos/>s men bring their mounts together to block your escape, but your horse is quick to the gallop. He surges forwards and forces himself between two troopers, barging them from the saddle as he pushes through their stationary ranks. As you break out of the circle, you hear a cry and it sends a shiver down your spine. You recognize the Prince<ch.apos/>s voice. When you glance back you see that he has been unsaddled and he is now lying on the ground, helpless before the stamping steel-shod hooves of the Knight Bachelor<ch.apos/>s warhorse.</p>

       <p>The voyage to Siyen begins early the next day, an hour after first light. After saying a final farewell at Amarelda<ch.apos/>s graveside, Karvas gathers together a few of his meagre belongings, frees his livestock, and then allows himself to be winched aboard the deck of the waiting <cite>Starstrider</cite>. There are now twenty-five days remaining before Harvestmas Day and the crowning ceremony in Seroa. Acraban calculates that the voyage by air should take no longer than twelve days to complete. This news fosters a cheerful mood of optimism for it means that the Prince should arrive in good time to be able to thwart Baron Sadanzo<ch.apos/>s plan.</p>
       <p>As the waters of the Sheasu Channel speed past the hull, and the crew of ten young Brotherhood initiates go about their airborne duties, you accompany Karvas to Acraban<ch.apos/>s quarters where the Prince is given new clothing to replace his goatskin hides. Acraban offers him the pick of several fine costumes that befit his highborn status, but the Prince chooses instead to dress in the simple, functional grey tunic, cloak, and breeches of a Sommlending journeyman.</p>
       <p><quote>I vowed to Amarelda that I would one day return to Siyen,</quote> says Karvas, fixing the clasp of his cloak. <quote>Yet never would I have expected to arrive thus<ch.emdash/>dressed as a Northlander aboard a flying ship!</quote></p>
       <p>For three days and nights the <cite>Starstrider</cite> sails eastwards across the vast uncharted forests of the Kelderwastes, a region where few men have ever set foot. Your natural curiosity fills you with a desire to learn more about this strange unexplored territory, yet you are prevented from observing its passing by an unending blanket of raincloud which keeps the timberland hidden from view. It is not until the afternoon of the fourth day that you observe gaps in the cloud cover through which you see swathes of dense forest and tracts of dark, volcanic rock. In the far distance you can hear a sound like thunder, and your keen Kai senses detect that the pressure of the surrounding air is beginning to rise and fall erratically.</p>

       <p>The speed and surefootedness of your Bhanarian stallions carry you and Karvas swiftly out of harm<ch.apos/>s reach. You soon reach the rubble-strewn gate of the fortress and dismount to lead your horses inside. Within its crumbling walls there stands a keep, a cylindrical structure of time-worn masonry. The upper parts have collapsed leaving huge chunks of broken stone heaped around its base. Where once stood a gate of gleaming bronze, now only a blackened hole remains. It provides access to the inner hall and you enter to take shelter from the torrential rain.</p>
       <p>Engravings in the ceiling and walls of this derelict hall tell you that this fortress was once occupied by the Elder Magi. Both you and Karvas are fascinated by the intricate carvings and you decide to split up and explore this hall further. In an alcove at its north side you discover a shrine dedicated to the God Kai. Clumps of wild laumspur are growing around its base and you discover enough here for 3 potions. (Each Potion of Laumspur is a Backpack Item. It will restore 4 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points when swallowed after combat.)</p>
       <p>You are examining the shrine more closely when suddenly you hear Karvas scream out in alarm.</p>

       <p>It has been a long time since Prince Karvas last visited Cavalia, but he is still able to remember the swiftest route from the citadel to the east gate. You ride fast and you are able to avoid the patrols of Citadel Guards that have been dispatched to hunt you down. You are anxious that your escape will be short-lived if the east gate is closed, yet fortune swings in your favour, for upon your arrival you discover a wagon has shed a wheel.

       <p>Lodamos sends an urgent order to the commander of the cavalry, Guard Captain Sneida, to muster a troop of his best men and horses and have them ready to ride within the hour.</p>
       <p><quote>Sneida is a most accomplished horseman, and he knows the road to Seroa better than any man in this city or province,</quote> says Lodamos. <quote>He and his troop will act as your escort to ensure that nothing delays your journey to the capital.</quote></p>
       <p>The sleeping citadel of Varedo comes alive as preparations are made for your speedy departure. Lodamos takes you and Karvas to the stables where you are given the pick of his personal steeds. Karvas chooses a young black stallion and you settle for a dark bay mare. Lodamos approves of your choice: these horses possess speed and stamina, qualities that may prove essential if you are to reach Seroa in time. As your mounts are being saddled, you meet with Guard Captain Sneida and the men of your escort. You are impressed by their eager readiness to carry out this unexpected duty, and by the quiet professionalism with which they go about their preparations.</p>
       <p>Baron Lodamos wishes you godspeed and bids you farewell as you climb into the saddle and get ready to set off from the citadel. It is still dark when you and your escort ride out of Varedo and head east across the plain, along a wagon-worn road that leads to Oberra. When darkness gives way to the golden light of the rising sun, the troop unfurls Lodamos<ch.apos/> personal banner which they carry proudly at the head of their column. It is a pale blue flag, trimmed with gold braids, and it depicts an owl clutching the blade of a sword. Karvas tell you that these symbols represent Lodamos<ch.apos/> motto<ch.emdash/><cite>Wisdom and Strength</cite>. His flag serves you well, for as the day unfolds, all the fellow travellers you encounter on the road hurriedly move aside to allow you to pass unhindered when they see Lodamos<ch.apos/> banner approaching.</p>
       <p>You ride all day and put more than a hundred miles behind you. It is dusk when Sneida brings the troop to the fortified chateau of Lord Jopas, Baron Lodamos<ch.apos/> younger brother. You stay there overnight, and in the morning the troop are furnished with fresh mounts for the coming day<ch.apos/>s ride across the Lucien Hills. This region of Siyen is one of great natural beauty and you enjoy the panoply of castles, chateaux, and richly wooded valleys which unfolds as you traverse the hill trail to Oberra. When night falls you find yourselves still within the boundaries of this hilly timberland. Captain Sneida is loath to make camp in the forest for it harbours packs of wild wolves that may be tempted to attack by the scent of the horses. He urges the troop to continue for several moonlit miles further until you reach the chateau of Baron Jayde. He is commander of the Lucien Province and a trusted friend of Baron Lodamos.</p>
       <p>The troop ride through a pair of open, torchlit gates and come to a halt inside a walled courtyard at the front of Baron Jayde<ch.apos/>s grand estate. Adjacent to the gates are a stables block and a paddock. Captain Sneida orders his men to put the horses in the paddock while he goes to inform Baron Jayde of your arrival. You are leading your horses into the paddock by the reins when your Kai Sixth Sense warns you of hidden danger. You look around the courtyard and suddenly you realize that something is amiss. Ever since you arrived at the chateau you have seen no sign of Baron Jayde<ch.apos/>s staff or guards. The estate is seemingly deserted. Then you hear Captain Sneida call out a welcome, and when you look to the chateau, you see the figure of a stout man standing in a doorway at the head of a grand flight of stone steps. <quote>Well met, Baron Jayde,</quote> calls Sneida, but his friendly greeting elicits no response. The man in the doorway is utterly immobile; not a flicker of emotion stirs his pale round face. Sneida approaches and quickens his pace. He is halfway up the steps when suddenly the rotund figure of Baron Jayde topples stiffly forwards and falls, face down, upon the flagstones. Fear chills your blood when you see the polished handle of a stiletto dagger protruding from between his shoulder blades.</p>
       <p>In that instant the trap is sprung. Suddenly the top of the courtyard is ringed by grim-faced soldiers armed with crossbows. <quote>Ambush!</quote> shouts Captain Sneida. It is the last word he will ever utter. In response to his shout of warning, the soldiers let loose a deadly volley of bolts that claim his life, and the lives of four of his men. As the dead and wounded scream and fall, you drag Prince Karvas to the ground in a desperate effort to save him from being hit.</p>

       <p>The Inquisitor-major snatches up a hunting horn that hangs by a cord strung around his neck, and he blows into it with great force. The discordant note rises in pitch until it passes beyond the normal range of the human ear. Moments later, a terrific pain shoots through your head that makes you grasp your skull with both hands. You call upon your Magnakai Discipline of Psi-screen to counter the attack and it does so, successfully. But Karvas has no such protections and you sense that a psychic assault this powerful, and at such close quarters, could leave him either paralysed or dead within a matter of seconds.</p>

       <p>The second tumbler clicks into position and the door of the safe swings open<footref id="sect75-1" idref="sect75-1-foot"/> to reveal a single scroll of vellum, embossed with a ribbon and a wax imprint of Sadanzo<ch.apos/>s seal. You unfurl the scroll and you are shocked to the core when you read its contents.</p>
       <p>The scroll is a contract between Baron Sadanzo and the Assassins<ch.apos/> Guild of Avalar. It states that the Guild will undertake the murder of King Oridon in return for 20,000 Orla. Half of this sum is to be paid in advance, with the balance due for payment upon successful completion of the assassination. The seal of the Assassins<ch.apos/> Guild is attached beside Sadanzo<ch.apos/>s mark to show that the full sum has since been received.</p>
       <p>You show the scroll to Karvas and he is outraged; here is proof beyond doubt that Sadanzo was responsible for the murder of his father, and clearly his act of foul treachery was part of his plan to seize the throne of Siyen. This shocking revelation fills Karvas with a renewed loathing for the Baron. He reaffirms his pledge to thwart Sadanzo<ch.apos/>s scheme and he vows, in memory of his father, that he will bring the traitor to justice.</p>

       <p>You strike a killing blow and the last of the robber knights tumbles backwards over the parapet of the bridge to splash into the rushing river. There is a moment of deathly hush, and then the silence is shattered by an eruption of whooping and cheering. The citizens of Voshno have gathered to watch your fight and now they are applauding your brave victory. For more than a month this band of murdering knights have been abusing the people of this hamlet, and any traveller who has sought to cross their bridge. Now, at last, their reign of terror has ended.</p>
       <p>The grateful villagers insist that you and Karvas spend the night as their guests at the Fuller<ch.apos/>s Inn, the best tavern and hostelry on the east bank of Voshno. Your horses are groomed and you are treated to a delicious feast at the owner<ch.apos/>s expense, after which you are given the finest rooms in the hostelry (you may restore 6 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points). As you are retiring to bed, you notice that Prince Karvas is smiling delightedly. At first you think it is just the food and fine ale that have cheered him so, but he tells you it is more than this. He explains that the east side of Voshno is Siyenese territory, part of his native country, and after ten years in exile he could not have wished for a more appreciative homecoming.</p>

As Karvas pulls shut the heavy metal lid, you pray to Ishir to protect everyone aboard the <cite>Starstrider</cite> in this desperate hour. In the dark confines of the locker your senses become super-sensitive to every movement and noise outside. Your stomach churns when the ship heaves from side to side, and you feel a chill run down your spine when you hear the cries of the terrified crewmen echoing across the decks. Then there is a sudden jolt and a fearful sound of screeching metal. The <cite>Starstrider</cite> has been losing height for several minutes, but now its angle of descent has become far steeper.

The effect is immediate and dramatic. The Prince revives and is able to pull himself upright on his horse. The Inquisitor-major and his fellow hunters, however, do not fare so well. They are immune to the sound of their own horn, but you use your Kai skill to turn the tables on them. Your notes occur at a higher frequency, one to which they are not immune. You watch with grim satisfaction as they wheel their horses about and gallop away in a desperate effort to put distance between themselves and the piercing sound of your Flute, which is filling their heads with an agonizing clamour.</p>

       <p>You hurry through the city, past grimy two-storey houses of hardwood that are silent behind their bolts and shutters. The wide thoroughfare leads to a stone bridge that traverses the River Tehda and then continues into the heart of the east quarter. Here you almost collide with a patrol of armed guards which is marching towards the river, and you are forced to take cover in a timber yard to avoid being seen. You observe the ten-strong patrol as it marches past. These men are clad in black quilted tunics and wide silk leggings, and they are armed with curved swords and hand-axes. All are almond-eyed and they have shiny black hair tied in a knot at the nape of their necks. Their leader, a stocky bull-necked sergeant, wears the emblem of Sejanoz emblazoned upon a scarlet armband. Patiently you wait for them to reach the bridge, yet as they do so, another patrol comes tramping along the avenue from the opposite direction. The east quarter of Bakhasa is a busy place even at this late hour. Rather than risk being seen and captured, you decide to remain hidden in the timber yard and attempt to catch a few hours<ch.apos/> sleep before dawn.</p>

I<ch.apos/>ll have his treacherous Cavalian head for this!</quote></p>
       <p>The Marshal sends messengers to the high-ranking noblemen of Siyen, all of whom have travelled to Seroa for the crowning. He musters them at the barracks and reads to them the contents of the scroll. They are outraged by what they hear, and they resolve to go immediately to the palace to confront Sadanzo. Escorted by a loyal regiment of Royal Guardsmen, the noblemen burst into the palace and meet with little resistance from Sadanzo<ch.apos/>s drunken knights. The Baron is cornered in a banqueting hall and confronted with the scroll, which he immediately denounces as a forgery. <quote>This is no fake,</quote> growls Marshal Phedros. <quote>I know your lowly seal when I see it.</quote></p>
       <p>Sadanzo draws his sword with his left hand and, with his right, he pulls a glowing green gem from the pocket of his ermine robes. Your Sixth Sense warns you that this stone is radiating strong psychic energies. Through its use, Sadanzo is able to exert a powerful control over the noblemen of Siyen. The gem flares in his hand and the noblemen, including Prince Karvas, cease all movement. They have become rigid, like a group of stone statues.</p>

       <p>You are pleased to discover that the stone hut is both empty and large enough to accommodate you and your horses with ease. Its ancient granite blocks keep out the chill mountain wind and its slate-tiled roof is in remarkably good condition. Once you have tended to your horses and settled them for the night, you and Karvas try to make yourselves comfortable on the flagstoned floor so that you can get a few hours<ch.apos/> sleep before daybreak. You are laying your cloak down on the ground when you discover an iron ring set into one of the flagstones. Closer inspection reveals the stone to be a hinged trapdoor and, when you pull it open, you discover a flight of steps leading down to a subterranean chamber. Positioned in the centre of this sunken chamber is a solid block of marble. A symbol has been carved in its surface, one that you recognize immediately: it is the tiger<ch.apos/>s-head emblem of Sejanoz<ch.emdash/>the Autarch of Bhanar.</p>

       <p>Lord Zinair tells the captain of <cite>The Azaktana</cite> to await his return. Then he accompanies you and Acraban along an avenue that leads away from the quayside and climbs steeply into the heart of the eastern quarter. Your first impressions of the port of Mydnight are less than favourable. In the stark glare of the full moon it seems to be little more than a brooding shamble of slate-roofed houses and reeking tenements built around a haphazard maze of narrow, rat-infested alleyways. At this late hour, few of the port<ch.apos/>s inhabitants are abroad. The only people you see are the few who dare to peek at your passing through the mullioned glass of their wretched hovels.</p>
       <p>The avenue leads eventually to a deserted market square which commands a view over the harbour below. Here you see a large iron cage with a thick cable attached to a ring at the centre of its roof. The cable is held taut by a winch fixed to the stern of the <cite>Starstrider</cite> which hovers 100 feet overhead. The faint hum of its magical engine can be heard wavering on the warm sea breeze. Acraban ushers you into the cage and clicks shut its iron door. He tugs a cord and immediately the cage is lifted off the ground and hoisted up to the rear deck of the skyship. Here you are welcomed aboard by the skyship<ch.apos/>s crew, all of whom are young acolytes of the Magicians<ch.apos/> Guild of Toran. Acraban takes you to his quarters located below the forward deck where he offers you and Lord Zinair some food and wine. After many months away from home it is good to taste Sommlending fare once more.</p>

       <p>Since his arrival in Mydnight earlier in the day, Acraban has learned that Prince Karvas does not reside here in the city. To search for him now would be futile and so you resolve to get some sleep and commence your hunt for the Prince at first light. Shortly after dawn, the three of you meet again on the main deck. Acraban suggests that you each spend the day scouting the city for information that may lead you to Karvas. He tells of three places where this information is most likely to be found. The first is a large trading post, known as Grosta<ch.apos/>s Warehouse, located on the south side of the harbour. The second is the Hall of the Judicars, a base for the officers who are elected by the citizens of Mydnight to maintain law and order in their city. And the third is The Smitheries, the artisans<ch.apos/> and tradesmen<ch.apos/>s district of Mydnight that is situated west of the quayside.</p>

       <p>Prince Karvas does not relish the prospect of having to face these riders, yet he goes along with your decision and patiently you sit and wait as they draw closer. Their leader is a broad-shouldered man with a ginger beard and long wavy hair. His hair fans out from around the edges of a conical helm that is topped by a pair of polished antlers. He brings his horse to a halt before you and regards your mounts with an appraising eye.</p>

       <p>You make your approach to within 40 yards of the gate by means of a road that runs parallel to the fast-flowing river. At this point you leave the road and scurry to take cover behind a pile of logs that are stacked at the river<ch.apos/>s edge, ready to be loaded aboard a barge which is moored close by. You can see a dozen soldiers patrolling the parapet above the river gate, and each one is clad in a suit of shiny armour made from lacquered steel scales and hardened leather. They are armed with bows, spears, and maces, and their shields display the head of a tiger-like creature baring ferocious fangs. Karvas whispers that it is the emblem of Autarch Sejanoz<ch.emdash/>the ruler of Bhanar.</p>

       <p>For several minutes you observe the guards as they march back and forth with their spears couched on their shoulders. During your watch you discover that the guardsmen are not the only ones who occupy this span. On a tiled ledge running beneath the parapet is a long line of roosting crows. They are resting shoulder-to-shoulder and are almost invisible against the jet-black stonework of the arch. Your careful observations tell you that the guards are alert and observant. It will be difficult to get past these men without being seen. If you are to gain entry to the city by this river route, first you will have to create a diversion to draw away the watchful guards.</p>

From his nest atop the mainmast, the lookout shouts out a warning and frantically he points towards the ground. You rush to the rail and peer over the side, your stomach churning with fearful anticipation of what you will see. Deep within the fathomless reaches of the fissures and chasms passing below, you glimpse flashes of blue-white energy. These bolts are growing brighter and louder as they streak towards the surface. One bolt escapes from a vent in the middle distance and rips open the sky. It skewers a cluster of steam clouds and blows them apart in a spectacular explosion of gas and flame. Once again you urge Acraban to order his helmsman to ascend, this time to avoid the new and deadly danger that is striking from below.</p>

       <p>The Bakhasian soldiers have undergone a dramatic transformation. Before they entered the temple their skin had the yellowy hue of tallow and their hair was silky black. Now their faces and hands are ghostly white, their hair has turned steely grey, and the pupils of their red-rimmed eyes have changed to a pale translucent amber. The sight of their gaunt faces chills your heart; they look more like animated corpses than living men.</p>
       <p>The procession leaves the temple at a funereal pace. At the rear of the column you can see four Bakhasians carrying a platform on their shoulders on which rests an elaborate shrine. It is fashioned from gold and jewels and has been crafted into the likeness of a tiger<ch.apos/>s head. Two huge ivory fangs protrude from its jaw and its jewelled eyes glow with a flickering scarlet fire. You notice that the tiger-like shrine resembles the emblem of Sejanoz which is embroidered upon the sleeves of the soldiers<ch.apos/> padded black tunics. As the platform-bearers draw level with the warehouse doorway, the head of the tiger shrine slowly rotates in your direction and two pencil-thin beams of red light shoot from its eyes. You duck back behind the doorway but you know that it is too late<ch.emdash/>the shrine has detected your presence and it is alerting the cadaverous soldiers to your hiding place. Your Sixth Sense informs you that it is the goodly aura of your Kai Weapon that has activated the shrine and betrayed your position.</p>

       <p>When you hear one of the platform-bearers shouting an order, you tell Karvas to get ready to run. You chance a glance around the doorway and your worst fears are confirmed when you see three Bakhasians advancing swiftly towards the warehouse. They are carrying what appear to be hollow, stubby spears that are connected by metallic piping to cylindrical backpacks. One of the advancing soldiers sees you and a puff of bubbling steam gushes from the tip of his spear. In the next instant, a solid projectile smashes through the warehouse wall, leaving a ragged hole in the brickwork less than a hand<ch.apos/>s breadth from your head.</p>

They salute you in a friendly manner as you rein in your horses and come to a halt beside their wagon. One of them, a bearded man with ruddy cheeks, leaves the circle and walks over to introduce himself and his companions. You learn that they, like Prince Karvas, are from Siyen. They are the great-great-grandchildren of warriors who fell here in battle exactly one hundred years ago to the day. They have come here all the way from Seroa on a pilgrimage to honour the memory of their fallen ancestors.</p>

       <p>After a few minutes, Prince Karvas dismounts and joins the circle of men at the Oridon Stone. He bows his head in reverence and offers up a silent prayer to Ishir to watch over the souls of the brave Siyenese who sacrificed their lives on this field of battle. While Karvas is praying, you talk quietly with the bearded man and learn that his name is Daventi. When you tell him that you and your companion are bound for Siyen, he offers you some words of advice. He tells you to be wary should you wish to cross the River Ioma at Voshno, the next town on the trail. The bridge has been seized by robber knights from Cavalia and they are demanding a heavy toll from anyone seeking to use the bridge. Rather than cross the river at Voshno, the man suggests that you should continue north along the trail. Three miles north of Voshno is a small farmstead at the river<ch.apos/>s edge. For a moderate charge the farmer will ferry you and your horses across the river by raft.</p>
       <p>Having paid his respects, Karvas walks away from the monolith and remounts his horse. As you turn your horses to leave, the friendly Siyenese salute you and bid you both good luck and godspeed on the road ahead. You return their kind gesture with a Kai salute before you and Karvas gallop off across the plain to resume your ride along the dusty trail.</p>

       <p>Back on the quayside you resolve to explore the tangle of alleyways that make up the city<ch.apos/>s eastern quarter in the hope of finding someone who is more willing to talk about the Prince. Unfortunately, your efforts garner no useful information.

       <p>Wizard Acraban and Lord Zinair are already waiting aboard the <cite>Starstrider</cite> by the time you reach the market square. The magician orders the boarding cage to be lowered and you are winched up to the skyship. They are disappointed to hear that your search for information has been in vain.

       <p>As your final blow shatters the second blade and breaks the spell that brought it to life, you hear the sound of a bell tolling in a lower level of the citadel. Your Sixth Sense warns you that it is an alarm bell; your escape from the dungeons has been detected.</p>
       <p>You leave the library and hurry across the sumptuous chamber to the shiny steel door by which you first entered this apartment. Soldiers are ascending the stairs towards it. You catch a glimpse of them and quickly you retreat into the chamber, slamming the door shut behind you. An attempt to secure the door is unsuccessful for the lock is jammed and the dial refuses to turn. Hastily you and Karvas barricade the door with furniture and then you look about for another way to escape. You see only one<ch.emdash/>through the window. The soldiers are pounding on the door and the barricade is shifting and collapsing as you and Karvas climb out onto a stone ledge. The barricade gives way and you hear the soldiers shouting as they force their way into the chamber. Then an arrow shatters against the surface of the ledge, only a few inches from your left boot. You look up and see Citadel Guardsmen with loaded bows leaning over the battlements above. Alerted by the tolling bell, they have spotted you on the ledge outside Sadanzo<ch.apos/>s chamber. When a second arrow pierces Karvas<ch.apos/> cloak, you take hold of the Prince<ch.apos/>s forearm and pull him with you as you step off the ledge and plummet towards the moat, 30 feet below.</p>
       <p>You hit the stagnant water with a mighty splash and immediately strike out for the surface. You break through the scummy film that floats on top of the water and, seconds later, you see Karvas emerge from the depths to gasp a lungful of clean air. Arrows are falling all about you. They drop from the battlements above, and they streak past your head, fired by archers who are running across the drawbridge.</p>

       <p>As the last of Sadanzo<ch.apos/>s knights crashes dead at your feet, you leap over his crumpled body and rush towards the rear of the stables where the slain knights<ch.apos/> horses are tethered to a rail. You and Karvas cut free the two sturdiest mounts and pull yourselves into their saddles. Prince Karvas wheels his horse about and rides him out into the courtyard. When you emerge from the stables, you are following close behind the Prince and struggling hard to keep your jittery horse from losing its footing on the smooth flagstones. Strewn around the walled yard and paddock are the bodies of slain and wounded troopers. Your heart goes out to these brave men, but you dare not stop to help them. To do so would be suicidal. Karvas gallops his horse towards the open gates and you hear shouts of alarm from the Cavalians positioned around the courtyard wall. They have recognized you and they are bringing their loaded crossbows to bear on your fleeing backs.</p>

       <p>The instant the cell door crashes shut, you use your Magnakai Discipline of Nexus to loosen the cords that bind your wrists, and then you untie the Prince. The air in this dark prison is dank and stifling, and what little ventilation that there is seems to come from the narrow crack that runs around the iron cell door. You vow to Karvas that this foul dungeon will not hold him for long, and you set about examining its walls and floor in the hope of finding a way to escape.</p>
       <p>You soon discover that you have been locked in the securest cell of the citadel, deep below the ground. Beyond its slimy walls there lies nothing but solid earth. Only the cell door offers a glimmer of hope, yet it has no handle, hinges, or keyhole visible on the inside. It is not secured by key but by a tumbler lock, similar to the lock of a safe, and it can be opened by means of a dial on the outside of the door. Placing your ear to its surface, you use your Magnakai Discipline of Nexus to will the lock tumblers to move. After a few moments you hear them begin to click over.</p>
       <p>You discover that there are three tumblers. To open the door, each one has to be turned to the correct position in sequence. Using your Sixth Sense, you determine that the first number in the sequence is equal to the number of horses you took from the Tehda Stables. The second is equivalent to the number of Lune one can normally expect to receive in exchange for 1 Gold Crown. The third in the sequence is equivalent to the number of towns and cities there are, at present, in the Doomlands of Naaros.</p>

       <p>You grab the soldier<ch.apos/>s spear and pull him off-balance. As he stumbles, Karvas moves forward and lands a powerful punch to the side of his head which sends the man tumbling into the river. He surfaces and attempts to shout out to attract his comrades on the parapet, but the strong current whisks him away before his bubbling cries can be heard.</p>
       <p>Stealthily you climb the steps to a flagstoned loading area that is crowded with soldiers and wagons. By keeping low and moving from one wagon to the next, you and Karvas are able to cross this concourse undetected. On the far side you discover a stone bridge that traverses the River Tehda. You hurry across it and enter a wide avenue which leads to the city<ch.apos/>s east quarter. Grimy two-storey houses of carved hardwood pass by on either side, silent behind their bolts and shutters. At the end of the avenue you almost collide with a patrol of armed guards which is marching towards the river, and hurriedly you are forced to take cover in a timber yard to avoid being seen. You watch the ten-strong patrol as it marches past, and note that these men are clad in black quilted tunics with wide silk leggings, and they are armed with curved swords and hand-axes. They are almond-eyed and they all have shiny black hair tied in a knot at the nape of their necks. Their leader, a stocky bull-necked sergeant, wears the emblem of Sejanoz emblazoned upon a scarlet armband. Patiently you wait for them to reach the river but, when they do, you see another patrol come marching along the avenue from the opposite direction. The east quarter of Bakhasa is a busy place, even at this late hour. Rather than risk being seen and captured, you decide to remain hidden here in the timber yard and attempt to get a few hours<ch.apos/> sleep before dawn.</p>

       <p>This time Acraban does not argue. He bellows the order to Kuo the helmsman to reverse the descent and change course, thirty degrees to port. The bow of the <cite>Starstrider</cite> rises up and the deck banks gently over to the left. But then a deafening <onomatopoeia>Crack!</onomatopoeia> explodes from somewhere below the stern, and you are thrown onto your hands and knees when a violent shock wave ripples along the decking. Acraban calls for a damage report and each crewman shouts his response in turn. The <cite>Starstrider</cite> has sustained a glancing blow from an energy bolt. It has torn away part of the hull plating and damaged one of the ship<ch.apos/>s two internal stabilizers, upon which it relies for level flight. The craft ceases to gain height and begins drifting to starboard. This change of course is accompanied by a jarring vibration that runs through the deck and superstructure.</p>
       <p>The surrounding sky is now a seething mass of billowing black clouds lit up by lethal blue-white bolts of lightning. The ship passes through a dark cloud and the metallic stench of ozone fills your nostrils. This harsh-smelling gas does you no harm, protected as you are by your innate Magnakai skill of Nexus. Likewise, Acraban suffers no ill effects from the gas for his magic is sufficient to counter it. But for Prince Karvas and the crew its effects are immediate and devastating. Clutching at their throats they lose their balance and fall to the deck, choking and spluttering as they fight for breath. Acraban instructs you to take the helm while he goes below to work on the damaged stabilizer. You follow his command and take control of the wheel from a barely-conscious Kuo. As the cloud passes the crew slowly recover, but you glimpse a fresh danger ahead. The <cite>Starstrider</cite> is drifting towards two large active fissures running parallel to each other, and a little over 100 feet apart. Sweat streaks your face as you struggle to steer a straight course between these fissures and so avoid the crackling bolts of energy that are hurtling out of their fiery depths.</p>

       <p>Moments later, Acraban emerges from the smoke that wreathes the stern deck. His robes are torn and a trickle of blood runs from a gash above his right ear. You use your Magnakai Curing skills to heal the wizard<ch.apos/>s wound and then, with Karvas<ch.apos/> help, you evacuate some injured crewmen from the crippled skyship. Acraban orders Bo<ch.apos/>sun Gora to go and assess the condition of his crew. He returns shortly and reports that out of the ship<ch.apos/>s original complement of ten men, three are now missing, three are wounded, and one is dead. The remaining three crewmen, himself included, have survived the crash with only minor injuries.</p>
       <p>Using your curing skills, you ease the pain of the badly-injured crewmen before helping Karvas and Gora to bury the dead man<ch.emdash/>Kuo the helmsman. The area surrounding the crashed skyship is thickly wooded and, with night fast approaching and a sky heavy with clouds, it is impossible for you to determine your exact location. Acraban proposes to contact Lord Zinair to inform him of the disaster by means of his seeing stone. But, to his dismay, he soon discovers that the magical artefact has been lost in the crash.</p>

       <p>The Inquisitor-major regards your Sommlending tunics and cloaks with deep suspicion. He is about to order his men to hold and search you, when suddenly you hear the wavering tone of a distant hunting horn come rolling across the plain.</p>

       <p><quote>We<ch.apos/>re back on the trail!</quote> says another.</p>

       <p>The Inquisitor-major glares at you and he grunts his displeasure. Yet he heeds the words of his fellow hunters and he wheels his horse about.</p>
       <p><quote>50 Orla to the man who makes the kill!</quote> he cries, and his companions give a raucous cheer. As they gallop away across the plain towards the distant foothills, you and Karvas breathe a sigh of relief before you continue your ride east towards Varedo.</p>

       <p>The Prince smiles when you refuse to let him attempt the long journey to Seroa alone.</p>
       <p><quote>Very well, Grand Master,</quote> he says. <quote>So be it. In truth, I could not hope for a more worthy companion on the road ahead. Come, let us plan our way as best we can.</quote></p>
       <p>Acraban has one of his men fetch his compass and charts from the skyship to help you to determine the swiftest route overland to Seroa. You quickly establish your present location and suddenly you realize how difficult the journey ahead will be. Seroa lies over 1,200 miles to the east, beyond mountains, plains, and uncharted wilderness. You calculate that in order to reach the city in time you must cover no less than 60 miles every day.</p>
       <p><quote>On foot, across such harsh terrain<ch.ellips/>it is impossible,</quote> says Acraban, shaking his head.</p>
       <p><quote>Perhaps so,</quote> replies Karvas, <quote>but if we had horses then it could be done.</quote></p>
       <p>You scan the surrounding forest and let your Kai senses wander afar. <quote>There are no horses in this timberland, my lord,</quote> you say, certain in the knowledge that your judgement is correct. Karvas acknowledges your skill with a wry smile.</p>
       <p><quote>I take great pride in my magical powers,</quote> interjects Acraban, jovially, <quote>but even I, my lord, cannot summon horses from out of the air. Where, pray tell, do you hope to find mounts with strength enough to carry you all the way home?</quote></p>
       <p>Karvas turns his eyes to the east and says: <quote>Why, in Bakhasa, of course. Mark you, the citizens of that foul city will not help us out of the goodness of their hearts, of that we can be sure. But they have horses<ch.emdash/>strong Bhanarian stallions. Perhaps, Grand Master, we shall be able to borrow a pair?</quote></p>
       <p>You laugh with Prince Karvas at the audacity of his plan and you feel your spirits rise. A long and dangerous journey lies ahead, yet you are impressed by the Prince<ch.apos/>s courage and determination, and you feel confident once more that your mission can succeed. Acraban also approves. He and his men will stay and restore the <cite>Starstrider</cite> and then fly back to Toran as soon as they are able.</p>
       <p>Mindful that time is not your ally, you gather your Weapons and equipment together in readiness to leave. After bidding farewell to Acraban and his crewmen, you set off with Prince Karvas into the Great Forest, heading east. The vast timberland is rich with game, roots, and berries, and you are able to hunt and gather food on the move (you gather enough for 2 Meals). By noon you have made good progress and have reached the eastern fringe of the forest. Beyond lies an undulating plain that gradually descends towards a wide river. To the northeast, sitting astride this river, you glimpse the dark outline of a city.</p>
       <p><quote>That<ch.apos/>s Bakhasa,</quote> says Karvas, confidently. You magnify your vision and estimate it to be no more than 30 miles distant. <quote>With luck, we should make it there by midnight.</quote></p>

       <p>You strike camp at dawn and set off along the plains road to the east. The morning sky is clear and sunny, and the air is filled with butterflies and the sound of bird song. Having now entered Siyen, and with ten days remaining to Harvestmas, you are feeling quietly confident that you will reach Seroa in time for Karvas to be crowned King. But the Prince is a little less optimistic. He tells you that you are now in the western province of Cavalia, a region which shares its name with its principal city. The province and city are ruled by Sadanzo, the evil Baron who seeks to usurp the throne of Siyen. Karvas advocates that you both remain vigilant until you are safely beyond the borders of his enemy<ch.apos/>s province.</p>
       <p>It is nearing noon when you first glimpse the towers and spires of Cavalia glinting on the horizon. The plains road leads directly to its fortified gatehouse, but Karvas is anxious to avoid entering the city. He proposes that you leave the road and use a smaller trail which threads through several small villages and settlements that ring the city. You are approaching the first of these villages when you see a troop of thirty horsemen riding towards you on the trail ahead. They wear chainmail armour and they each have the emblem of a black eagle<ch.apos/>s head emblazoned upon their white surcoats and shields. A golden crown surmounts these eagles<ch.apos/> heads and Karvas gasps when he sees them. He signals to you to rein in your horse and, as you come to a halt, he tells you that the approaching horsemen are wearing the livery of Baron Sadanzo. The black eagle<ch.apos/>s head is his mark, but it is the addition of a golden crown that has shocked Karvas. It is the sign of royal ascendance. Karvas is fearful that Baron Sadanzo has already been crowned King of Siyen.</p>
       <p>As they ride nearer, the leader of the troop<ch.emdash/>a Knight Bachelor<ch.emdash/>motions his horsemen to leave the trail and encircle you and the Prince. As they obey his command, the Knight Bachelor brings his snorting steed to a halt alongside your horse.</p>
       <p><quote>Hail, fellow riders,</quote> he says, with forced politeness. He raises the visor of his helmet and his dark, suspicious eyes scrutinise you from head to toe.</p>
       <p><quote>You are Northlanders, are you not? What business do you pursue here in the province of Cavalia?</quote></p>

       <p>After an interminable wait you arrive at the front of the slow-moving queue. Without looking up from the books and papers spread around him, the reeve-sergeant motions you to sit down on the bench before his table. With a tone of bored indifference he asks you to state the reason for your visit to the Judicars<ch.apos/> Hall. You tell him that you are looking for Prince Karvas of Siyen, and that you have come here with urgent news of events in his homeland that you must impart to him. The officer rubs his stubbly chin and stares unblinkingly into your eyes. You sense that he doubts your word and is contemplating whether or not he should have you arrested. When you insist that it is vital that you find the Prince he gives a gruff laugh and shrugs his shoulders.</p>
       <p><quote>Karvas is not here,</quote> he grunts. <quote>Lived here when he first came to Sheasu, maybe ten years ago now, but when his bride arrived he took her up north.

The stench of its dark, unnatural blood disturbs the horses, so you and Karvas drag its tattered carcass away and roll it into a nearby ravine. By the time you return to the shelter of the ledge, Karvas is exhausted. He is having difficulty staying awake, and so you volunteer to sit out the rest of the night watch. You spend the early hours of the morning listening to rain beating on the ledge, and the desolate sound of the wind whistling through the mountains.

       <p>As the soldier approaches you suddenly realize that he is only aware of Prince Karvas. He has not seen you; the darkness and your innate Kai camouflage skills have kept you hidden from sight. Silently you sidestep into the shadows and unsheathe your Kai Weapon. Karvas stands immobile on the footpath and stares fixedly at the approaching guard so as not to betray your presence. Nervously the soldier reproaches the Prince and levels his spear at his chest. He commands Karvas to state the name of his commanding officer, and when he fails to reply, your Kai Sixth Sense suddenly warns you that this guard is about to raise the alarm.</p>
       <p>With the speed and grace of a pouncing panther, you leap from the shadows and strike the guard on the side of the head with the hilt of your weapon. Without uttering a sound he crumples at the knees and falls unconscious on the path. Quickly you and Karvas drag his body away and hide it beneath the steps. Before you go, you make a quick search of the soldier<ch.apos/>s pockets and backpack and discover the following items:</p>
       <ul>
        <li>30 Ren (equivalent to 3 Gold Crowns)</li>
        <li>Spear</li>
        <li>Dagger</li>
        <li>1 Meal</li>
       </ul>
       <p>You also discover an iron key that bears an inscription on its shank. Your Magnakai Pathsmanship skills enable you to decipher its meaning: <quote>This key is the property of the Tehda Stables</quote>.</p>
       <p>If you wish to keep this Tehda Key, record it on your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a> as a Special Item which you carry in the pocket of your tunic. You need not discard another item in its favour if you are already carrying the maximum number of Special Items permissible.)</p>
       <p>Stealthily you climb the steps to a flagstoned loading area that is crowded with soldiers and wagons. By keeping low and moving from one wagon to the next, you and Karvas are able to cross this concourse undetected. On the far side you discover a stone bridge that traverses the River Tehda. You hurry across it and enter a wide avenue which leads to the city<ch.apos/>s east quarter. Grimy two-storey houses of carved hardwood pass by on either side, silent behind their bolts and shutters. At the end of the avenue you almost collide with a patrol of armed guards which is marching towards the river, and hurriedly you are forced to take cover in a timber yard to avoid being seen. You watch the ten-strong patrol as it marches past, and note that these men are clad in black quilted tunics with wide silk leggings, and they are armed with curved swords and hand-axes. They are almond-eyed and they all have shiny black hair tied in a knot at the nape of their necks. Their leader, a stocky bull-necked sergeant, wears the emblem of Sejanoz emblazoned upon a scarlet armband. Patiently you wait for them to reach the river but, when they do, you see another patrol come marching along the avenue from the opposite direction. The east quarter of Bakhasa is a busy place, even at this late hour. Rather than risk being seen and captured, you decide to remain hidden here in the timber yard and attempt to get a few hours<ch.apos/> sleep before dawn.</p>

       <p>You follow the trail until the sun is no more than an orange glow across the western horizon; then you halt to make camp for the night beneath a solitary oak tree. A dull-witted rabbit provides you with an evening meal, after which you and Karvas take it in turns to sit watch as darkness enshrouds the plain.</p>
       <p>The warm night passes peacefully and you strike camp shortly after dawn. With only twelve days remaining to Harvestmas, you keep your horses to a swift pace as you ride the trail northwards. During the afternoon you are treated to the majestic sight of a herd of migrating fanji. These wild, fleet-footed beasts are native to this region and are much prized for their horns and supple hides.</p>

       <p>In a burst of sudden rage, the blacksmith slaps the Gold Crowns from out of your hand and scatters them across the floor. Before you can retrieve them he orders his son to chase you out of their workshop. Rather than resist and risk slaying them both in a fight, you turn and run towards the door. (Erase from your Belt Pouch the number of Gold Crowns that you have lost here in the blacksmith<ch.apos/>s shop.)</p>
       <p>Hurriedly you return to the quayside where you stop to catch your breath. After a while you resolve to explore the tangle of alleyways that make up the city<ch.apos/>s eastern quarter in the hope of finding someone more willing to talk about the Prince. Unfortunately, your efforts garner no useful information. As the sun begins to settle on the horizon, you finally abandon your search and hurry back through the darkening passageways towards the market square.</p>
       <p>Wizard Acraban and Lord Zinair are already waiting aboard the <cite>Starstrider</cite> by the time you reach the market square. The magician orders the boarding cage to be lowered and you are winched up to the skyship. They are disappointed to hear that your search for information has been in vain. Fortunately, Lord Zinair<ch.apos/>s efforts have been more fruitful.</p>
       <p><quote>Prince Karvas is not here,</quote> he says. <quote>He lived here when he first came to Sheasu some ten years ago, but a young woman called Amarelda arrived soon after and they were married, here, in the harbour. They left Mydnight the day after their wedding and settled somewhere on the northern coastline. It has been more than a year since they last visited the city.</quote></p>
       <p>Turning to Acraban, Zinair says: <quote>I propose we travel north at first light and commence a search of the northern shoreline. I suspect it will be easier to espy their retreat from the air than to attempt any search by land.</quote></p>
       <p>Acraban nods in agreement. Then he passes word to his young crew to prepare the <cite>Starstrider</cite> for a voyage north at first light.</p>

       <p>At dawn, Marshal Phedros prepares a written proclamation denouncing Sadanzo as a traitor, a murderer, and an agent of Naar. Phedros revokes the Baron<ch.apos/>s kingship and he announces that Crown Prince Karvas shall accede as rightful heir to the throne of Siyen. The proclamation is signed by the nobles of Siyen, and then hundreds of palace scribes set about making copies that are affixed with the Marshal<ch.apos/>s seal and dispatched by messengers to every town, city, and province in the realm.</p>
       <p>News of Karvas<ch.apos/> return spreads like wildfire through the capital, aided by a legion of town criers who announce that the Prince<ch.apos/>s crowning will take place at noon in the Palace Square. Hundreds of cheering citizens fill the square when you and Karvas and the other dignitaries arrive by horse-drawn coach for the ceremony. The populace are weeping and shouting with joy that they are to be spared the tyranny of Sadanzo<ch.apos/>s rule. With the blessing of the gathered nobles, Marshal Phedros proclaims Karvas the true King of Siyen, and with due solemnity he places the State Crown upon his head. Gladly Karvas accepts his birthright and he rises to receive the adulation of the excited crowd. As the cheering gradually subsides, he turns to you and bids you kneel before him. You obey his command and Karvas unsheathes his sword. He dabs its blade lightly upon your head and smiles.</p>
       <p><quote>Arise, Sir Kai, for I proclaim that you are now a Knight of Siyen.</quote> The crowd cheers loudly, though not for their king. This time their cheers are for the Kai Grand Master of Sommerlund without whom their beloved Prince would never have claimed his throne.</p>

       <p>Bravely your horse obeys your command and he leaps through the fire to land surefootedly on the trail beyond. The flames scorch your skin, yet your protective Magnakai skill of Nexus prevents you from sustaining any lasting injury. However, your horse is less fortunate. His flanks and belly are badly blistered by the fire. Mercifully, you ease his pain and heal his singed flesh through the swift use of your Magnakai Curing skills.

       <p>The pitiful shrieks and groans of fallen men echo in your ears as you struggle to get back on your feet. <quote>Stay with me, sire,</quote> you say to Karvas, as you scurry across the paddock and take cover behind a fence post. There is a lull in the carnage when your cowardly attackers pause to reload their crossbows, and you take full advantage of this momentary respite. You signal to Karvas to follow as you leap up and sprint from the paddock to the open doorway of the stables close by.</p>
       <p>As you rush through the doorway you are brought skidding to a halt when you are confronted by seven armoured knights. Your stomach churns when you see that they wear the eagle<ch.apos/>s-head emblem of Sadanzo upon their surcoats. Their presence here makes you realize that they have been following your trail ever since your daring escape from Cavalia. The delay that you experienced at Varedo bought them the few hours they needed in order to get ahead of you and set up their deadly ambush.</p>

       <p>You run past the gate guards and through the open archway into a flagstoned concourse. By keeping low and hiding in the shadows, you and Karvas are able to cross this open plaza undetected and make your way along an empty avenue which bisects the city<ch.apos/>s west quarter. Grimy two-storey houses of carved hardwood pass by on either side, silent behind their bolts and shutters.</p>
       <p>The avenue leads to a stone bridge that traverses the River Tehda and then continues into the heart of the east quarter. Here you almost collide with a patrol of armed guards which is marching towards the river, and hurriedly you are forced to take cover in a timber yard to avoid being seen. You watch the ten-strong patrol as it marches past. These men are clad in black quilted tunics and wide silk leggings, and they are armed with curved swords and hand-axes. They are almond-eyed and they all have shiny black hair tied in a knot at the nape of their necks. Their leader, a stocky bull-necked sergeant, wears the emblem of Sejanoz emblazoned upon a scarlet armband. Patiently you wait for them to reach the bridge but, as they do so, another patrol comes marching along the avenue from the opposite direction. The east quarter of Bakhasa is a busy place, even at this late hour. Rather than risk being seen and captured, you decide to remain hidden here in the timber yard and attempt to get a few hours<ch.apos/> sleep before dawn.</p>

       <p>Karvas pulls up the sleeve of his tunic and advances towards Phedros to show him the crescent-shaped birthmark on his wrist. But Phedros, his senses wine-dulled, mistakes his advance for an attack. <quote>Seize them!</quote> he bellows, and immediately four of the Marshal<ch.apos/>s bodyguards emerge from the shadows of the mess hall. Two of them wrestle Karvas to the ground, while the others come rushing at you with their swords drawn. Rather than risk the Prince<ch.apos/>s life by resisting these guards, you raise your hands in surrender. Karvas begs Phedros to believe that he truly is the Crown Prince of Siyen. He asks that he be allowed to explain how he returned to his homeland, but Phedros refuses to listen to his pleas. He calls for more guards and he commands them to confiscate your Weapons and equipment. Then you are both taken to the barracks<ch.apos/> cells where you are placed in irons.</p>

       <p>It is in the early hours of the morning when the cell door bangs open and in shuffles Marshal Phedros in the company of Baron Sadanzo and a dozen of his robber knights. The Baron cackles with glee when he sees Karvas chained to the wall. He takes a glowing green gem from the pocket of his ermine robes, and immediately your Sixth Sense warns you that this stone is radiating strong psychic energies. Through its use, Sadanzo is able to exert a powerful control over Phedros<ch.apos/> mind.</p>
       <p><quote>So, Marshal Phedros,</quote> says Sadanzo, in a quiet, silky-smooth voice that is chillingly evil, <quote>this is the impostor and his accomplice. Pray tell me, my lord, what is the punishment for impersonating a member of the Royal household?</quote></p>
       <p><quote>It<ch.ellips/>is<ch.ellips/>death,</quote> croaks Phedros. By the forced sound of his voice you can tell that the Marshal does not speak of his own free will.</p>
       <p>Prince Karvas rails against his shackles and shouts out in protest, but the gem flares in Sadanzo<ch.apos/>s hand and instantly Karvas ceases to speak or move. Your Sixth Sense tells you that your psychic Kai defences are preventing you from succumbing to the power of this evil gem, a power that has rendered Karvas incapable of speech or movement.</p>
       <p><quote>Well, my loyal knights,</quote> says Sadanzo, addressing his gloating henchmen, <quote>did you not hear the Marshal? The punishment for their crime is death.</quote> The Baron looks at you and Karvas and a malicious smile spreads slowly across his taut, cadaverous face. <quote>By the power invested in me as King of Siyen, I sentence you both to death. Sentence to be carried out<ch.ellips/>at once!</quote></p>
       <p>And with these fateful words ringing in their ears, the robber knights unsheathe their swords and move forward to carry out the Baron<ch.apos/>s order of execution. Mercifully, death is swift for you both.</p>
       <deadend>Tragically, your life and your quest end here in the cells of the Royal Cavalry Barracks of Siyen.</deadend>

The pain in your head is growing more intense, and you can see that Prince Karvas is so badly affected that he is close to falling from his saddle. Yet, the moment you blow the horn, the pain subsides. No sound issues from this golden horn, yet your senses detect it has the power to counter the psychic assault you are suffering. Prince Karvas revives and he is able to pull himself upright on his horse. The hunters, however, do not fare as well. The psychic assault that they inflicted upon you is turned back on them by the power of your horn. You watch with grim satisfaction as they wheel their horses about and gallop away, desperate now to put distance between themselves and the piercing sound of your horn which is filling their heads with an agonizing clamour.</p>

       <p>This riverside inn is in urgent need of some paint and repair, yet for all its shabby outward appearance it is a very popular tavern. Its taproom is filled to overflowing with customers. The sound of lyre and pipe music mingles with the chatter and raucous laughter of its patrons, many of whom are river travellers bound for Seroa within the hour. You push your way through the noisy crowd and climb a flight of stairs that give access to rooms on the upper storey. From the top of the stairs you are able to get a better view of the crowded bar room. Karvas points out two men who are standing at the tavern counter.

       <p>The smooth surface of the tower wall proves to be more difficult to climb than expected. You come to within an arm<ch.apos/>s length of the window ledge before your fingers slip and you fall into the street, striking your head on the cobblestones as you land heavily on your back: lose 3 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points.</p>
       <p>When the throbbing pain in your skull diminishes to a dull ache, you make a second attempt to reach the window. This time your efforts are rewarded. On reaching the window, you haul yourself through its open frame and drop down onto the steps of a stone stairway beyond. This circular staircase leads to the top of the tower and offers you a magnificent view of the city. Aided by your night vision, you are able to locate stables less than a mile to the north of the tower. You commit their location to memory and then hurriedly you descend the stairs and return to the window. Once more you use your climbing skills, this time to make a speedy descent to the street below.</p>
       <p>Prince Karvas is delighted to hear that there are stables in the city, and he insists that you set off for them at once. He is leading the way out of the warehouse ruins when suddenly the tower bell begins to toll once more. Moments later, the temple doors swing open and the procession of black-clad figures file out into the street. Instinctively you take hold of Karvas by the arm and pull him back into the ruins to avoid being seen by the emerging soldiers. As they pass by, you peer around the edge of the crumbling warehouse doorway to watch them. A strange feeling of unease makes the skin on the back of your neck prickle, and immediately you sense that all is not what it seems. When you magnify your vision to take a closer look at the passing figures, you gasp with shock at what you see.</p>

       <p>Slowly you step away from the boulder and motion Acraban to follow as you descend the steep trail to the beach. Prince Karvas walks towards you, his right hand resting purposefully on the hilt of a short sword sheathed by his side. Despite his dishevelled appearance, he moves with a proud aristocratic gait that reveals his noble ancestry.</p>
       <p>With a polite formality usually reserved for the King<ch.apos/>s court and council chambers, Acraban bows to the Prince and makes his introductions. In sober tones he informs him of the unhappy events which have transpired in Siyen, events which have brought you both to Sheasu in search of him. Prince Karvas is saddened to hear of the death of his father. He glances at the mound of sand close to the base of the trail and you notice a tear in his eye. Lying alongside this mound is a plank of driftwood carved with the name <cite>Amarelda</cite>. It marks the last resting place of the Prince<ch.apos/>s young wife.</p>
       <p><quote>This is bitter news you bring, my lords,</quote> says Karvas, his sonorous voice wavering with emotion, <quote>for my grief is doubled. I have now lost my wife and my father<ch.emdash/>the only two people I have ever truly loved.</quote></p>
       <p>You and your companion offer the Prince your deepest condolences, and Acraban suggests that perhaps it would be best if you all left the beach. Karvas nods his consent and together you climb the trail back to his house atop the cliffs.</p>
       <p>Over a cup of berry wine, Prince Karvas tells you the story of how he came to Sheasu to live the life of an outcast. A decade earlier, during a chance encounter in a foreign court, he had met and fallen helplessly in love with Princess Amarelda<ch.emdash/>the daughter of the King of Lunarlia. She, too, had fallen for him, and had accepted his offer of marriage. For centuries the neighbouring lands of Lunarlia and Siyen have been enemies, yet the sudden prospect of a marriage between Prince Karvas and Princess Amarelda promised to put an end to many years of rivalry and bloodshed. At first his father, the King of Siyen, approved of their union. But later he changed his mind and forbade his son to marry her on pain of exile. Karvas defied his father and was forced to leave his homeland. He travelled to Sheasu where he was later joined by his beloved Amarelda. She, too, had disobeyed her father<ch.apos/>s command and had been cast out for her act of defiance. Karvas talks fondly of the years they spent here alone together. Then, with sadness, he tells you that she recently fell ill with a fever from which she never recovered. For more than a month she fought the illness until, only three days ago, she passed away quietly in her sleep.</p>
       <p>The news that Baron Sadanzo plans to steal his birthright enrages the Prince. For years he has blamed the Baron for his exile, for he alone openly opposed the marriage that would have healed the rift between Lunarlia and Siyen. Karvas is convinced that the Baron turned his father<ch.apos/>s mind with sorcery, and he agrees readily to leave Sheasu and journey with you aboard the <cite>Starstrider</cite> to Seroa to thwart Sadanzo<ch.apos/>s plan. The Prince<ch.apos/>s willing acceptance to return to his homeland raises your spirits. Acraban proposes a toast to the future King of Siyen and Karvas accepts the gesture in good humour. Then Acraban imparts the glad news to Lord Zinair by means of the seeing stone given to him by the elder magician. Zinair, who is sailing back to Suhn, congratulates you both for successfully finding the exiled Prince and he wishes you all a safe and speedy air voyage to Siyen.</p>

       <p>You take it in turns to keep watch throughout the night in case a pursuit party is sent from Cavalia to track you down. Fortunately, the night passes peacefully and you leave the wood shortly before dawn. As the sun crests the eastern horizon, you see a signpost at the roadside which says: <quote>Varedo<ch.emdash/>150 miles</quote>.</p>
       <p><quote>Normally one could expect to reach Varedo in three days by horse,</quote> says Karvas, <quote>but if we use every hour of daylight and rest our mounts briefly, every hour, we may be able to cover the distance in half the time.</quote> Mindful that you now have only nine days in which to reach Seroa to be in time for the crowning, and wary that a pursuit party could still be sent from Cavalia to hunt you down, you spend this day in the saddle riding as far and as fast as your horses are able. By nightfall, you have made excellent progress and you are confident that the threat from Cavalia is no more. You camp for the night beside a stream and, before you sleep, you use your Magnakai skills to assist the horses to recover fully from their hard day<ch.apos/>s ride.</p>
       <p>The following day is spent crossing the seemingly endless Lucien Plain, the monotony of the grasslands broken only occasionally by an isolated hamlet or farmstead. You have no need to approach these settlements for the rich prairie yields enough game to keep you well fed while you are on the move. It also provides surplus food equivalent to 2 Meals (adjust your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a> accordingly if you wish to keep one or both of these Meals).</p>
       <p>During the afternoon, you see a group of riders approaching from the north, from out of the wooded foothills of the Ioma Range. You magnify your vision and your stomach churns when you see that they are carrying spears which display the black eagle<ch.apos/>s-head pennant of Baron Sadanzo. You focus your Kai senses upon this distant group of riders and detect that they are not soldiers. They are a hunting party seeking wild deer. The open plain offers no place to hide from these approaching horsemen and the lack of cover makes you feel especially vulnerable. You remain stationary for a few minutes while you watch them draw closer. You are hoping that they are too preoccupied with their hunt to pay you any attention. However, you soon realize that they have lost the trail of their wild deer and have decided to track new quarry<ch.emdash/>you and Karvas.</p>

       <p>You launch a pulse of mental energy at the archer and it sears his mind (use of this Grand Master Discipline costs you 1 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> point). The man screams and recoils from the sudden pain that has invaded his head. As he falls backwards, he releases his arrow and it arcs through the air to shatter uselessly against the wall of the stables.</p>
       <p>Karvas leaps into the saddle and you toss him the reins. With a cry of elation, you wheel your horse about and spur him towards an avenue on the east side of the square. You and the Prince gallop side by side along this broad thoroughfare as fast as your mounts will carry you, trampling any Bakhasian who is foolish enough to stand in your way. The road leads directly to the city<ch.apos/>s east gate where a bell is tolling loudly. A crowd of militiamen have gathered at the gate, summoned from their beds by the alarm, but they are without their officer and in the chaos and confusion they have forgotten to close the gate. They scatter in all directions as you thunder along the avenue towards them and you are able to escape through the open archway without challenge.</p>
       <p>Whooping with excitement, you race away from Bakhasa along a dusty trail that heads towards the foothills of the Dammerdon Mountains. You glance to your side and see Prince Karvas punch the air victoriously. Clearly he is as excited by this daring escape as you are; he has a grin fixed to his sweat-streaked face that stretches from ear to ear.</p>
       <p>The strong Bhanarian stallions carry you swiftly into the foothills and never once do they falter in their stride nor slacken their impressive pace. Only when you can no longer see the lights of Bakhasa do you let them slow to a canter. For more than an hour you travel the trail as it meanders through pine-covered hills and shallow valleys. The night sky is clear and the way ahead is illuminated by bright starlight. When you come to a shallow ford that crosses a fast-flowing stream, you stop here awhile to let your horses drink their fill.</p>
       <p>Unless you possess the Discipline of Grand Huntmastery, you must now eat a Meal or lose 3 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points.</p>

       <p><quote>So you<ch.apos/>re on your way to Seroa, eh?</quote> says the Knight Bachelor. <quote>If you are there in time for Harvestmas then you<ch.apos/>ll see the crowning of Baron Sadanzo. I only wish I could be there myself to celebrate that happy day. Alas, someone must remain to protect Cavalia while our master, our future king, is away.</quote></p>
       <p>Karvas asks the young knight why he and his men are wearing the crown of Siyen upon their shields and surcoats. <quote>I thought,</quote> he says, taking care to mask his native Siyenese accent, <quote>that it is customary here in Siyen for only soldiers of the King<ch.apos/>s Guard to wear the royal crown? Is it not so?</quote></p>
       <p>The Knight Bachelor glares at Karvas and you sense that the Prince<ch.apos/>s comments have stung him. <quote>Our master is<ch.ellips/>will be<ch.ellips/>the King of Siyen,</quote> he blusters. <quote>There is no other who claims the throne of our realm. We wear the crown in honour of his right to ascendance. Perhaps you foreigners oppose our Baron<ch.apos/>s right?</quote></p>
       <p>The Knight Bachelor stares accusingly into your eyes. When he gets no reaction, he jerks his head back to Karvas and fixes the Prince with the same cold, unblinking gaze. Your Kai Sixth Sense informs you that this Knight Bachelor is a greedy and ambitious young man who is hungry for promotion. Unwittingly, Karvas has insulted his honour and, to save face in front of his men, he is thinking of arresting you both on the suspicion that you are spies. You know that you must act swiftly if you are to avoid this.</p>

       <p>You gallop out of the courtyard amid a hail of bolts, and race east along the forested hill trail. The Cavalian crossbowmen have hidden their horses in the woods surrounding Baron Jayde<ch.apos/>s chateau, and when they see you escaping, they quickly abandon their positions around the courtyard wall and mount up to give chase. Your daring escape puts you more than a mile ahead of your ruthless pursuers, but this trail is difficult to ride at night for you are guided only by the light of the moon. You have little difficulty keeping your horse to the twisting trail for you are aided by your Kai night vision, but Karvas is not so fortunate. Some parts of the trail are covered by a thick canopy of branches which shut out the ashen moonlight. Whenever you pass through these sections, Prince Karvas is plunged into darkness and he is forced to slow his pace dramatically. Rather than risk having him lose the trail completely and crash headlong into the trees, you call to him to leave the trail at a place where it passes over a wooden bridge. You hide with your horses beneath this bridge and wait for the Cavalians to pass. You hear their horses<ch.apos/> hooves thunder across, but you do not emerge when they have gone. Patiently you wait, and within the hour you hear them returning. They have lost your trail and they are going back to Baron Jayde<ch.apos/>s chateau in the belief that you have slipped past them and doubled-back to rescue the few wounded troopers who survived the ambush.</p>
       <p>The Cavalians return across the bridge, and when you can no longer hear their horses, you emerge from your hiding place and continue east along the trail. During your night ride to Oberra, unless you possess the Discipline of Grand Huntmastery, you must eat a Meal or lose 3 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points.</p>
       <p>Shortly after daybreak, you emerge from the dense timberland and pass through a region where the hills are given over to the cultivation of grapes and vines. During the day, you and Karvas take it in turns to sleep in the saddle. While one is asleep, the other leads his companion<ch.apos/>s horse by the reins. By this method you are able to overcome the fatigue of your recent ordeals and still make good progress along the trail to Oberra.</p>
       <p>It is early in the morning, four days before Harvestmas, when you crest a ridge of high ground and see Oberra in the distance. This populous city nestles in a bowl-shaped valley at the eastern edge of the Lucien Hills, where the uplands meet the softly undulating flood plains of the River Seroa. Prince Karvas tells you that his old tutor, Florin Sainus, resides in Oberra. He proposes that you ride to the city and visit his house in the northern quarter. Karvas is confident that Sainus will help you reach Seroa in time for the crowning. Your spirits are lifted by this welcome news, and you ride with renewed vigour until you reach the gates of Oberra late in the afternoon.</p>

The fighting has been heard throughout the tavern and a group of anxious locals, led by the tavern-keeper and armed with pitchforks and staves, are gathering outside in the courtyard. Rather than attempt to reason with them, you and Karvas saddle two fresh horses and gallop out of the stables as fast as you can. The tavern-keeper and his patrons scatter in all directions to avoid being trampled as you race across the courtyard and escape onto the highway beyond.</p>
       <p>Despite the fatigue of your deadly combat, you force yourselves to ride all night. Early next morning, you stop to rest in a small coppice that borders the highway.

       <p>The Prince<ch.apos/>s scream came from the south side of the hall. As you run towards it, your heart misses a beat when you see that a large section of the stone flooring has collapsed. With trepidation, you reach the edge and look down into a yawning hole. Prince Karvas is hanging by one hand to an outcrop of jagged rock some 15 feet below. Over 100 feet below his dangling legs there rages an underground river, swollen by the flash flood.</p>

       <p>Beyond the draperies you find a circular chamber with a polished wooden floor. The dark oak surface is inlaid with lighter woods which form intricate pentagrams and other mystical patterns. The walls are lined with shelves which store a vast number of books, scrolls, and parchments. Your Kai senses warn you that these are works of great evil; it is a library of sorcerous manuals and tomes of worship dedicated to Naar. Prince Karvas is repulsed by the sight of this evil repository. It confirms the suspicion he has held for many years, that Baron Sadanzo is a secret disciple of the Dark God.</p>
       <p>You scan the walls and your Kai senses reel in the face of the evil that festers here. Your instincts tell you to destroy these vile works, to put them to the torch, yet to do so could jeopardise your chances of making a successful escape from the citadel. Rather than take that risk you decide to leave this evil library at once, but as you are retreating towards the archway you notice a square plate of steel sandwiched among the books on a middle shelf. A closer look reveals it to be the door of a wall safe. There is a dial at its centre, similar to the cylinder lock which secured the door to your prison cell. Your Sixth Sense reveals that only two digits are required to open this safe.</p>

To counter this persistent drift you pull the wheel hard over to port, but the effects of her damaged stabilizer are unpredictable, making it almost impossible for you to maintain sure control of the helm. You over-compensate for the drift and quickly find yourself directly above the left-hand fissure, gliding helplessly into the path of a cluster of soaring energy bolts. Desperately you pull the wheel hard over to the right to avoid a collision but it is already too late.

       <p>Word of the shrine<ch.apos/>s destruction spreads quickly. Within minutes of your escape, the sleeping city is rudely awakened by a cacophony of alarm bells and discordant horns. Search parties are mustered and soon the major avenues of the city echo to a new sound<ch.emdash/>the tramp of vengeful patrols dispatched to track you down. By using your advanced Kai tracking skills and taking care to avoid the main thoroughfares, at length you are able to reach the stables that you saw from the top of the temple bell-tower. From the cover of a cart parked across a square from its double-gated entrance, you observe the building and the passing patrols and wait patiently for the commotion to die down.</p>
       <p>The stables are surrounded by a high brick wall topped by a row of foot-long spikes embedded in mortar. A sign hangs above the main entrance that reads <quote>Tehda Stables</quote>. The tolling bells have roused the stable guards and this entrance is now heavily guarded, as are three smaller entrances set at intervals along its perimeter wall. Only one door has no armed guard posted before it, but when you magnify your vision you quickly see why this is so. It is secured by three steel bolts and a heavy iron lock.</p>

       <p>Normally these two fops would blanch and faint in the face of such an open threat, but a night spent drinking at the tavern has filled them with liquid courage. The taller man stares Karvas defiantly in the eye and then he begins to shout at the top of his voice: <quote>Robbers! Footpads! Cut-throats!</quote></p>
       <p>Karvas reacts instinctively. He punches the dandy squarely on the jaw and leaves him sprawled unconscious on the ground. His stout companion freezes and his mouth drops open with shock. Before he, too, can scream out in alarm, you knock him out with a sharp blow to the nape of his neck.</p>
       <p>Quickly you drag their bodies into the alleyway and rifle their pockets in a search for their tickets. Karvas finds both of them in the jacket pocket of the stout lordling, and he hands one to you.

       <p>You are desperate to keep ahead of the herd for fear of being trampled under their pounding hooves. Yet, as you approach the fast-flowing river, you are forced to tug hard on your horse<ch.apos/>s reins to slow him to a walk. The bank ahead is steeply undercut. If you were to rush headlong over the edge, you and your horse would plummet more than 20 feet into the rushing river.</p>
       <p>Fortunately, Karvas reacts swiftly when he sees you slowing your horse and he is able to rein in his mount behind you. Following your lead, he coaxes his horse over the edge of the steep bank and he is able to control his descent down the bank towards a narrow strip of muddy clay at the water<ch.apos/>s edge. Above you, the leading fanji come thundering over the edge to tumble into the river with a mighty splash. They barely break the surface before they are swept downstream by the strong current. More than a hundred fanji crash into the river and are washed away before the remainder of the herd comes to a halt. You coax your horse forward and for two miles you keep him to the narrow strip of sticky soil which borders the river, until you reach a place where the steep bank tapers away to a gentle incline. Here, you are able to leave the river and climb the bank to the grassy plain. As you crest the top of the bank, you see the remaining herd scattering in all directions as, relentlessly, the hunters pursue them.</p>

       <p>The troopers tie your hands with cord before they take you and Karvas to Cavalia under close escort. As you ride through the city<ch.apos/>s grand west gate, the guards on duty here come stiffly to attention. The Gate Sergeant salutes the Knight Bachelor with great exaggeration, and some of the older guards bow and doff their helmets as he passes, but their actions are not born of a respect for him or rank. You sense that they despise the haughty knight, and this is their way of mocking his insufferable arrogance.</p>
       <p>Beyond the gate, you enter a wide avenue flanked by a well-ordered collection of houses and richly-appointed public buildings. Cavalia is a wealthy city, yet many of the citizens that you glimpse in passing have a strained and uneasy look about them. At length you arrive at a fortified citadel<ch.emdash/>a huge, square, moated edifice built on four levels around a central courtyard. Its upper floors contain the Baron<ch.apos/>s luxurious personal chambers, as well as other apartments used by those who have his favour. The middle level is occupied by provincial officials and the ground floor by the Citadel Guard. There is also an underground level, which is used for the imprisonment and torture of Sadanzo<ch.apos/>s enemies. Vaingloriously the Knight Bachelor leads his horsemen across the citadel drawbridge and through a torchlit tunnel that gives access to the central courtyard. Here, you and Prince Karvas are pulled from your saddles by Citadel Guardsmen and dragged away to the dungeons where you are thrown into a dark, windowless cell.</p>

       <p>You spend the evening aboard the <cite>Starstrider</cite> in the company of your two companions. In the comfort of Acraban<ch.apos/>s quarters, you study charts and maps of the Isle of Sheasu in preparation for tomorrow<ch.apos/>s voyage. The northern coastline stretches for more than 200 miles and it is indented with hundreds of bays and tiny inlets. Searching this territory for Prince Karvas<ch.apos/> home will be a difficult task, yet, thanks to the <cite>Starstrider</cite>, not an impossible one.</p>
       <p>Lord Zinair gives Acraban a small seeing-stone, one of a pair that he possesses. It will enable him to stay in contact with the elder magician and inform him when the Prince has been found. Lord Zinair has decided it is best that he go back to Suhn aboard <cite>The Azaktana</cite>. He has fulfilled his promise to Lone Wolf that he would escort you swiftly and safely here to Mydnight, and the time has now come for him to return to his ambassadorial duties. Before he leaves for his ship moored in the harbour, he wishes you both a swift, sure, and successful voyage.</p>
       <p><quote>I look forward to the day we shall meet again, my lords,</quote> he says. <quote>Though I shall not be with you in body, my spirit will travel with you all the way to Seroa. Good luck and godspeed.</quote></p>
       <p>You rise before daybreak and as the first rays of the morning sun creep over the horizon, you hear Acraban giving the order to commence the voyage north. From the forward deck rail you watch in fascination as the hovels and harbour of Mydnight slide gently away beneath the keel. The hum of the skyship<ch.apos/>s engine increases in pitch as it steadily gains speed and altitude, until soon all you can see are the hills and valleys of Sheasu whirling past far below.</p>
       <p>The flight to the north coast takes a day to complete. Upon arriving in this remote region you soon realize that the shoreline will prove more challenging to explore than had been expected. Much of the coast is forested, and there are countless miles of undercut cliffs and steep ravines that could keep entire villages hidden from the air. For two days the <cite>Starstrider</cite> follows the coastline with all hands on lookout duty, yet no human habitation is sighted. It is not until the afternoon of the fourth day of your voyage that your luck changes for the better. An eagle-eyed crewman on the forward deck spots a tiny clearing on a wooded peak overlooking a crescent-shaped bay. You magnify your vision and see, in the centre of this clearing, a single-storey house with a split log roof, surrounded by animal pens and shelters. You feel sure that you have found the Prince<ch.apos/>s retreat and you ask Acraban to bring the skyship down within a mile of the settlement so as to avoid the risk of frightening him away. He complies, and within a matter of minutes the <cite>Starstrider</cite> is hovering above the tree-line less than a mile from the clearing. Acraban hands over command of the skyship to Gora, his bo<ch.apos/>sun, and then you and he are lowered to the ground in the boarding cage.</p>
       <p>After landing, you quickly discover a narrow trail that wends its way through this thickly-wooded headland. You volunteer to take the lead and you follow this track as it meanders towards the clearing. Wind whistles through the surrounding pines but the timberland itself is strangely silent; you can hear no sound from the beasts and birds that dwell herein.</p>

       <p>You take a scroll, one of many that are crammed between the books that line the surrounding shelves, and you place it in the empty safe. Then you recite the words of the Brotherhood Spell <spell>Lightning Hand</spell> and point your right index finger at the scroll. An arc of crackling fire jumps from your hand and ignites the yellowed parchment, causing it to burn fiercely. You wait for a few moments until all that remains of the scroll is a layer of flaky ash, and then you slam shut the door and spin its dial. Now, should Sadanzo open his safe, he will find that his contract with the Assassins<ch.apos/> Guild has mysteriously combusted.</p>
       <p>Your work done, you turn away from the safe and motion Karvas to follow as you hurry to leave this evil library. But, as you are approaching the arch which leads to the adjoining chamber, you suddenly hear a noise which makes you both stop dead in your tracks.</p>

       <p>The courtyard is bounded on three sides by paddocks, tack rooms, and an equestrian training park. There are only two guards on duty here inside the compound, the others having been called upon to assist the patrols that are out searching the city. They are both asleep at their posts and you have no difficulty tiptoeing past them and entering the paddocks where the horses are stabled.</p>
       <p>You search the stalls and soon discover two black Bhanarian stallions of magnificent quality and breeding. They will make ideal mounts for you and Prince Karvas. These intelligent animals respond readily to your Magnakai Discipline of Animal Control and they remain calm and composed as you hurriedly fix their saddles and bridles. As you are leading them out into the courtyard, you stop to unbuckle a sword belt from the belly of a sleeping guard. Prince Karvas is unarmed and you are sure he will appreciate this weapon more than its present owner.</p>
       <p>You lead the horses across the courtyard and as you approach the stables<ch.apos/> main doors, you mount one of them and fix the reins of the other to your stirrup. Then you kick open one of the double doors and urge your horse forward at the gallop.</p>
       <p>The guards outside are taken completely by surprise. As they fumble to unsheathe their swords, you race across the square and wave to Karvas who is waiting patiently for your signal. The Prince leaps up from behind the cart and comes running towards the spare horse. He is getting ready to leap for its saddle when a gruff cry alerts you to danger. A patrol has entered the square and their officer is commanding his sergeant to fire at you with his bow.</p>

       <p>You fix the trader with a piercing stare and quietly breathe the words of the Brotherhood Spell <spell>Mind Charm</spell>. As the spell takes hold, you command him mentally to signal to his men that all is well between you. Your magical charm instils a sense of calm well-being into the man and he begins to relax and smile. He complies with your command and the two Mythenians turn away. When you are sure that they are out of earshot, you ask the trader if he knows the whereabouts of Prince Karvas of Siyen. He tells you that the Prince does not reside in the city. There is a rumour that he lives somewhere on the remote northern coast of Sheasu. He also tells you that Karvas is not alone. Shortly after he came here, almost a decade ago, he was joined by a young woman. They were married by a sea captain in Mydnight harbour, on board the deck of his trading ship, and ever since their wedding day they have rarely been seen again.</p>
       <p>You thank the trader for his help and leave the warehouse before the effects of the spell wear off. On returning to the quayside you set out to explore the tangle of alleyways that make up the city<ch.apos/>s eastern quarter in the hope of discovering more about the Prince and his wife. Unfortunately, your efforts garner no new information. As the sun begins to settle on the horizon, you abandon your search and hurry back through the darkening passageways towards the market square.</p>

       <p>As you ride through the fields that border upon the packed highway, you receive a chorus of catcalls from the queue that alerts the gate guards to your approach. You rein in your horses at the South Gate and Karvas demands that you be allowed in at once. An angry guard demands to know why you should not wait in line like everyone else, and Karvas says: <quote>We are court riders from Oberra. We carry an important message for Marshal Phedros. Let us in at once.</quote></p>
       <p>You pray that the guard will believe the Prince<ch.apos/>s bluff and let you enter, but you can tell by the man<ch.apos/>s grim expression that he is not impressed.

The man beckons to a group of his fellow guardsmen who are standing at an archway in the gatehouse wall. <quote>You<ch.apos/>ll have to see the captain first,</quote> he says, brusquely.</p>

       <p>The speed and surefootedness of your Bhanarian stallions carry you and Karvas swiftly out of harm<ch.apos/>s way.

       <p>The final tumbler clicks into place and the door creaks open a few inches.<footref id="sect211-1" idref="sect211-1-foot"/> The corridor outside the cell is unguarded, and you beckon Karvas to follow as you push the door wide and leave. As you step out, you see the door to the cell that contains your Weapons and equipment and you pause for a few moments to work on its tumbler lock. Your efforts are quickly rewarded and you discover all of your confiscated equipment lying here on the floor. (You may erase the asterisks [*] from your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a> to indicate that your arms and equipment have been restored.)</p>
       <p>In addition to your equipment you also discover Prince Karvas<ch.apos/> sword and belt, together with the following:</p>
       <ul>
        <li>Bow</li>

       <p>Karvas buckles on his sword belt and, before you leave, he takes a coil of rope from a hook on the wall and slings it over his shoulder.

With your Kai Weapon in hand you begin to climb the steps, retracing the route that you committed to your memory when you were brought to the cell less than an hour ago.</p>

       <p>You look to the nearby barge, with its cargo of logs strapped to its deck, and a bold plan forms in your mind. Drawing upon your mastery of Elementalism, you cause one of these canvas straps to ignite spontaneously. Rapidly the fire burns through the strap and, with a thunderous roar, five of the heavy logs roll off the deck and splash into the river. Sped along by the swift current, they ram into other barges moored downstream and punch holes through their hulls at the waterline. When the guards on the parapet see one of the barges sinking, they raise the alarm and muster a rescue party to attempt to save its valuable cargo.</p>

       <p>The rolling plain to the west of Bakhasa is a bleak and barren steppe that is studded with countless thousands of sawn-off tree stumps. Once this region was part of the Great Forest of Kelderwood, yet in recent times the ruler of Bhanar, Autarch Sejanoz, has commanded the Bakhasians to harvest the forest<ch.apos/>s valuable hardwood and dispatch it downstream to feed the insatiable imperial shipyards of Otavai. Travelling on foot, the stumps are no obstruction to your progress and you are able to press on without stopping until late in the afternoon. As you crest a ridge of high ground, you spot a troop of horsemen escorting a line of wagons laden with timber. They are less than a mile distant and they appear to be heading towards a settlement on the banks of the River Tehda. You wait and watch them until they are dots on the horizon before continuing your trek towards the city of Bakhasa.</p>
       <p>You are within 20 miles of Bakhasa when dusk begins to darken the gloomy sky. Karvas requests that you stop and rest awhile before making a final push for the city. You are feeling hungry after your long day<ch.apos/>s march and you readily agree. (Unless you possess the Discipline of Grand Huntmastery, you must now eat a Meal or lose 3 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points.)</p>
       <p>Night falls within an hour of you resuming your trek, yet the distant lights of Bakhasa and its surrounding settlements enable you to stay on course and maintain an impressive pace. The city is lit by hundreds of fiery beacons which mark the outline of its ancient perimeter wall and angular watchtowers. These fires also illuminate the surface of the River Tehda which passes through the centre of Bakhasa. To the south of the city, lines of tethered barges stacked high with logs lie moored along both of its paved banks. Under cover of the night, you are able to move through the outlying settlements without being seen. When at last you hear a bell in the city tolling the midnight hour, you find yourself upon a knoll overlooking a rutted road which approaches Bakhasa<ch.apos/>s west gate. Using your night vision, you scan the high perimeter wall and note the positions of guards posted around its tiled parapet. They are greatest in number above a wide stone archway where the glimmering river flows out of the city. Prince Karvas is eager to enter the city before dawn and he asks you to choose the way. Aware that it may prove easier to find and take some horses while most of Bakhasa<ch.apos/>s inhabitants are still asleep, you scan the perimeter wall once more and consider how best you can pass beyond it.</p>

       <p>The man pockets your money (erase the appropriate amount from your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>) and chuckles to himself as he swaggers to the side of the bridge.

       <p><quote>Move it y<ch.apos/>selves!</quote> he bellows. Cursing his insolence, you jump down from the saddle and drag the cart lengthways to make room enough to pass. Then you remount your horse and ride with Karvas, in single file, across to the other side.</p>
       <p>The River Ioma is the political boundary between the realms of Lunarlia and Siyen. For centuries, Voshno has been claimed by both kingdoms and its inhabitants have grown used to the disruption that comes from living astride a border between two frequently-warring nations. Currently the hamlet is divided evenly. You notice that Prince Karvas is smiling as he rides with you away from the river, and you ask him why this is so, especially after having just been fleeced by the boorish toll collector. He explains that this half of Voshno is Siyenese territory, part of his native country. After ten years in exile he has at last returned to his homeland.</p>
       <p>There is less than an hour left before it will be dark, and so you suggest to him that you stop at an inn to celebrate his return home over a tankard of Siyenese ale. He agrees, and you ride into the courtyard of the nearest tavern. Outside its door there hangs a board displaying the prices of its food, ale, and lodging. Its list of charges have all been struck out and replaced with new figures that are ten times more than the original costs. Shocked by the exorbitant prices, you decide to forgo your celebratory ale and leave Voshno.</p>

       <p>Having agreed the places where each of you will begin your search for the whereabouts of Prince Karvas, you follow Acraban to the rear deck and enter the skyship<ch.apos/>s boarding cage. Swiftly it is winched down to the market square where you are met unexpectedly by a jostling crowd of grimy-faced street urchins. They have been gathering here since dawn to stare in wonderment at the <cite>Starstrider</cite> hovering motionless in the cloudless sky above. Acraban hurls a handful of copper coins across the cobblestones and the children scramble to retrieve them. This creates enough space to allow Zinair to push open the cage door and the three of you to step out. After agreeing to return to the skyship no later than sunset, you split up and go in search of your chosen destinations.</p>
       <p>Unlike the urchins, the adult population of Mydnight appears less than fascinated by the imposing sight of the <cite>Starstrider</cite> hovering above their city, and few give it a second glance. This seeming lack of interest does not surprise you. For centuries this port has been a refuge for exiles from the many nations of Magnamund who, for their own individual reasons, have chosen to forsake their native lands. They are, by nature, a secretive community. Any overt interest in the affairs of another is commonly viewed with suspicion and distrust.</p>
       <p>You retrace the route you took last night and soon find yourself at the harbour. <cite>The Azaktana</cite> is still moored at the quayside and you give the crew a friendly wave as you stride across the quayside towards The Smitheries<ch.emdash/>the city<ch.apos/>s west quarter. This district of Mydnight is crowded with the workshops of skilled artisans and craftsmen<ch.emdash/>ironsmiths, potters, carpenters, weavers, wheelwrights, and glassblowers to name but a few. Most are honest men seeking refuge from the greedy barons and landlords of their native lands. Some have come to escape their debts, while others have found themselves brought here by some misfortune. The noise that fills this quarter of the city is almost deafening. The ceaseless hammering of iron and copper blends with the cries of sellers to create a reverberating wall of sound.</p>
       <p>You enter a blacksmith<ch.apos/>s shop that has an impressive display of knives, tools, and other utensils fixed to the beams which support its slated roof. You hope that Prince Karvas may have purchased items from this shop sometime in the past and you ask the owner if he knows of him and his whereabouts. The blacksmith scowls with disdain and turns his back on you. Your Kai Sixth Sense tells you that he suspects you to be an assassin who has come here to Mydnight to find and murder the Prince. He motions to his son who is working the bellows of a furnace nearby. You realize you must act quickly if you wish to allay the blacksmith<ch.apos/>s suspicions and avoid a confrontation with his son.</p>

       <p>Early next morning, before dawn, you meet with Karvas and Sainus and go to collect your horses from the stable. As you mount them, the old man bids you good luck and he gives the Prince a pouch containing 50 Orla, a sum that could prove useful during the ride to Seroa.</p>
       <p>Dawn breaks as you leave Sainus<ch.apos/> house, and you hear a bell which signifies that the night curfew has now come to an end. You ride along the streets of the north quarter and enter a broad avenue that leads directly to the east gatehouse. The guards posted here are opening the great east gate as you approach, and you gallop through the widening gap.</p>
       <p>The sun shines brightly all day and you make good progress along the King<ch.apos/>s Highway. By nightfall you have covered more than 80 miles and have reached a small village called Landsdorf. You decide to stop and rest at the village<ch.apos/>s solitary tavern<ch.emdash/>the Golden Plough Inn<ch.emdash/>and as you ride into its courtyard a young stable boy runs to greet you and take care of your horses. Two rooms here cost 10 Orla, a sum which Prince Karvas pays in full using part of the money given to him by Sainus. The jovial tavern-keeper hands you each a key and he offers you a tankard of his best ale, on the house.</p>
       <p>You accept his generous offer and enter the taproom of this hospitable tavern. As your frothing beer is being drawn from the cask, you overhear a conversation at a nearby table. Three farmers are discussing the crowning ceremony and one of them says that it is to take place at noon. This news unsettles Karvas, for traditionally the ceremony of ascendance begins at dusk, as soon as the sun disappears below the horizon. If what the farmer says is true, you now have only one and a half days left in which to reach Seroa in time for the crowning. You resolve to get as much sleep as you can this night, and then ride for Seroa at dawn. If you forgo sleep tomorrow and journey through the night, you can still arrive at the capital before noon on Harvestmas Day. Karvas prays that your horses are fit enough for the gruelling ride, and you are both glad that you have decided to rest them here tonight. They will need all their strength come the morning.</p>

       <p>You speak the words of the Brotherhood Spell<ch.emdash/><spell>Levitation</spell><ch.emdash/>and feel your feet leaving the dusty street as you ascend effortlessly towards the second-storey window. When you draw level with the window you counter the spell and step through its tall frame onto a stone stairway beyond. This circular staircase leads to the top of the tower which commands a magnificent view of the city. Aided by your night vision, you are able to locate stables less than a mile to the north of the tower. You commit their location to memory and then hurriedly you descend the stairs and return to the window. Once more you use your Brotherhood magic, this time to slow your descent as you step through to the street below.</p>
       <p>Prince Karvas is delighted to hear that there are stables in the city, and he insists that you set off for them at once. He is leading the way out of the warehouse ruins when suddenly the tower bell begins to toll once more. Moments later, the temple doors swing open and the procession of black-clad figures file out into the street. Instinctively you take hold of Karvas by the arm and pull him back into the ruins to avoid being seen by the emerging soldiers. As they pass by, you peer around the edge of the crumbling warehouse doorway to watch them. A strange feeling of unease makes the skin on the back of your neck prickle, and immediately you sense that all is not what it seems. When you magnify your vision to take a closer look at the passing figures, you gasp with shock at what you see.</p>

       <p>Beyond the east gate of Battle Pass, the trail winds down through craggy borderland towards the lush river valley of the River Ioma, where an ocean of sun-yellowed grasses sways languidly in the warm afternoon breeze. This rolling vista has a graceful tranquillity that reminds you of the Southlund Marches of southern Sommerlund. It stirs fond memories of childhood days in that distant province and prompts an unexpected bout of homesickness that dampens your spirits. Karvas, too, is feeling a little melancholy. Yet his mood is not born out of a longing for his homeland, but from a sense of loss. You ask what ails him and, with some reluctance, he tells you:</p>
       <p><quote>The beauty of this valley belies its bloody past,</quote> he says, and he sweeps his arm across the distant horizon. <quote>Many of my ancestors and countrymen have fought and died here in battle. For the Siyenese it is a land filled with proud and bitter memories.</quote> He points to a distant spire of rock and, when you magnify your vision, you see that its grey granite surface is too smooth and symmetrical for it to be a natural feature of this rolling plain.</p>
       <p><quote>There stands the Oridon Stone,</quote> he says. <quote>It marks the graves of ten thousand men who fell at the battle of Inkil Reach.</quote></p>

       <p>Your Kai senses lead you to believe that a storm is brewing, but it is unlike any you have encountered before. The blanket of cloud, which has been a constant feature of the voyage so far, is beginning to dissipate. As it thins out it reveals a stark landscape of black volcanic rock far below. This tortured landscape is scarred by deep chasms and fissures, some of which emit jets of steam that roar skywards to buffet the hull of the <cite>Starstrider</cite> as it flies past. Some of these colossal jets condense to form strange green-grey clouds which slowly drift and tumble back to the ground. One such cloud forms in the air and begins to fall on a collision course with the ship. Acraban sees the threat and he orders Kuo, his helmsman, to descend 300 feet in order to evade the falling cloud mass.</p>
       <p>As the <cite>Starstrider</cite> begins its descent there is a startlingly loud explosion. From his nest atop the mainmast, the lookout shouts a warning and points frantically towards the ground. You rush to the rail and peer over the side, your stomach churning with fearful anticipation of what you will see. Deep within the fathomless reaches of the fissures and chasms passing below, you glimpse flashes of blue-white energy. These bolts are growing brighter and louder as they streak towards the surface. One bolt escapes from a vent in the middle distance and rips open the sky. It skewers a cluster of steam clouds and blows them apart in a loud and spectacular explosion of gas and flame. You urge Acraban to order his helmsman to ascend, to avoid the new and deadly danger that is striking at you from below. The wizard turns to Kuo, but before he can issue the order, there is a deafening <onomatopoeia>Crack!</onomatopoeia> from somewhere beneath the stern.</p>

       <p>You hurry past the gate guards and through the open archway into a flagstoned concourse. By keeping low and hiding in the shadows, you and Karvas are able to cross this open plaza undetected and make your way along an empty avenue which bisects the city<ch.apos/>s west quarter. Grimy two-storey houses of carved hardwood pass by on either side, silent behind their bolts and shutters.</p>
       <p>The avenue leads to a stone bridge that traverses the River Tehda and then continues into the heart of the east quarter. Here you almost collide with a patrol of armed guards which is marching towards the river, and hurriedly you are forced to take cover in a timber yard to avoid being seen. You study the ten-strong patrol as it marches past. These men are clad in black quilted tunics and wide silk leggings, and they are armed with curved swords and hand-axes. They are almond-eyed and they all have shiny black hair tied in a knot at the nape of their necks. Their leader, a stocky bull-necked sergeant, wears the emblem of Sejanoz emblazoned upon a scarlet armband. Patiently you wait for them to reach the bridge but, as they do so, another patrol comes marching along the avenue from the opposite direction. The east quarter of Bakhasa is a busy place, even at this late hour. Rather than risk being seen and captured, you decide to remain hidden here in the timber yard and attempt to get a few hours sleep before dawn.</p>

       <p>You urge your horse towards the wooded hillock and enter the trees with just seconds to spare before the leading fanji come flashing past. You look about you but Karvas is nowhere to be seen. You fear he has been trampled by the stampede, but then he suddenly appears from out of the thundering wall of beasts. He is bruised and battered but he is still astride his horse and in full control of him. He veers his frightened steed away from the herd and comes galloping up the slope of the hillock towards the sanctuary of the trees. He pulls to a halt by your side and strokes the neck of his whinnying horse to reassure and calm him.</p>
       <p>As the herd rush past the hillock, you glimpse more than a dozen horsemen who are galloping close behind them. They are hunters and they are picking off the best fanji at close quarters with bows and spears. Two of these fur-clad plainsmen see you and Karvas recovering among the trees, and instantly they steer their horses away from the herd and urge them towards the hillock. You sense that they suspect you and the Prince are after their quarry and, as they ride closer, they mouth curses and fire their bows at you.</p>
       <p>Their steel-tipped shafts arc through the air and thud into the trees close by.</p>

       <p>Karvas leaps into the saddle and you toss him the reins of his horse. With a cry of elation, you wheel your stallion about and spur him towards an avenue on the west side of the square. You and the Prince gallop side by side along this broad thoroughfare as fast as your horses will carry you, trampling any Bakhasian who is foolish enough to stand in your way. The road leads directly to the city<ch.apos/>s east gate where a bell is tolling loudly. A crowd of militiamen have gathered at the gate, summoned from their beds by the alarm, but they are without their officer and in the chaos and confusion they have forgotten to close the gate. They scatter in all directions as you thunder along the avenue towards them and you are able to escape through the open archway without challenge.</p>
       <p>Whooping with excitement, you race away from Bakhasa along a dusty trail that heads towards the foothills of the Dammerdon Mountains.

Clearly he is as excited by this daring escape as you are, for he has a grin fixed to his sweat-streaked face that stretches from ear to ear.</p>
       <p>Your strong Bhanarian stallions carry you swiftly into the foothills and never once do they falter in their stride nor slacken their impressive pace. Only when you can no longer see the lights of Bakhasa do you let them slow to a canter. For more than an hour you travel the trail as it meanders through pine-covered hills and shallow valleys. The night sky is clear and the way ahead is illuminated by bright starlight. When you come to a shallow ford that crosses a fast-flowing stream, you stop awhile to let your horses drink their fill.</p>

       <p>You leave the jetty and hurry to the tavern. This riverside inn is in urgent need of some paint and repair, yet for all its shabby outward appearance, its taproom is filled to overflowing with customers. The sound of lyre and pipe music mingles with the chatter and raucous laughter of its patrons, many of whom are river travellers bound for Seroa within the hour. You push your way through the noisy crowd and climb a flight of stairs that gives access to rooms on the upper floor. From the top of the stairs you are able to get a better view of the crowded bar room. Karvas points out two men who are standing at the tavern counter. They are dressed in dandified court costumes and they wear Sadanzo<ch.apos/>s eagle<ch.apos/>s-head emblem pinned to velvet berets that are resting on their coiffured heads.</p>

Gladly Karvas accepts his birthright and he rises to receive the adulation of the excited crowd. As the cheering gradually subsides, he turns to you and bids you kneel before him.

The citizens of Seroa shower their new king with flowers. They also call for the swift execution of the traitor Sadanzo. The following day you learn that Karvas has granted his citizens their request for justice. Baron Sadanzo is sentenced to death, the execution to be carried out at noon in the Palace Square. Upon the platform on which he sought to be crowned king, the Baron loses his head to the executioner<ch.apos/>s axe.</p>

       <p>You are getting ready to leave the derelict warehouse when the tower bell starts to toll. Minutes later a long line of black-clad figures, mostly soldiers, comes filing along the street towards the building. Two great doors swing open to receive this procession and you catch a glimpse of the building<ch.apos/>s cavernous interior. It is richly appointed with tapestries and golden ornaments, yet, despite its beautifully crafted opulence, you feel nothing but a sense of revulsion. Your Kai Sixth Sense informs you that this place is a temple wholly devoted to the worship of an evil deity.</p>
       <p>As soon as the procession has entered, the doors are closed and the bell ceases to toll. Shaken but undeterred by what you have witnessed, you leave the warehouse and hurry across the street towards the base of the tower.</p>

Patiently you bide your time until an hour later, when you hear footsteps in the corridor outside followed by the sound of the tumbler lock spinning. The door creaks open and in strides the Knight Bachelor, accompanied by an escort of six armed guards. The knight is holding a short-bladed sword in one hand, and a wooden bowl filled with vile-smelling gruel in the other. He offers the bowl to Prince Karvas at arm<ch.apos/>s length.</p>

       <p>The trader becomes flustered and angry when you put away your gold, and he signals to his henchmen to throw you out of his emporium. They move towards you in eager readiness to obey their master<ch.apos/>s command. Rather than resist and risk slaying them in a fight, you allow yourself to be manhandled out of the warehouse.</p>
       <p>Back on the quayside you resolve to explore the tangle of alleyways that make up the city<ch.apos/>s eastern quarter in the hope of finding someone who is more willing to talk about the Prince. Unfortunately, your efforts garner no useful information. As the sun begins to settle on the horizon, you finally abandon your search and hurry back through the darkening passageways towards the market square.</p>
       <p>Wizard Acraban and Lord Zinair are already waiting aboard the <cite>Starstrider</cite> by the time you reach the market square. The magician orders the boarding cage to be lowered and you are winched up to the skyship. They are disappointed to hear that your search for information has been in vain.

Karvas, too, is having difficulty with his horse and he cannot keep up the pace. Steadily the hunters close the gap between you. When they are less than 100 yards distant, you see their leader place a horn to his mouth and you hear a shrill and piercing tone echoing across the plain. Pressure builds in your head and sharp stabbing pains burn at your temples.

Rather than risk having to face them all, you decide that now would be a good time to leave.

As soon as you are clear, you race away together as fast as your horses will carry you.</p>
       <p>You are more than two miles from the hillock when you bring your panting steeds to a halt and look back. You see the fanji herd have been scattered by the hunters and they are running in all directions. The hunters show no interest in pursuing you; their only concern appears to be slaying as many fanji as possible. The sight of this wanton slaughter raises your ire, but you quell your anger and ride on with Karvas through the tall grass, back towards the trail.</p>

Here you are treated to a spectacular view of the city. Aided by your night vision, you locate stables less than a mile to the north of the tower.

       <p>On your return to the warehouse, Prince Karvas is delighted to hear that there are stables in the city and he insists that you set off for them at once. He is leading the way out of the ruins when suddenly the tower bell begins to toll once more. Moments later, the temple doors swing open and the procession of black-clad figures file out into the street. Instinctively you take hold of Karvas by the arm and pull him back into the ruins to avoid being seen by the emerging soldiers. As they pass by, you peer around the edge of the crumbling warehouse doorway to watch them. A strange feeling of unease makes the skin on the back of your neck prickle, and immediately you sense that all is not what it seems. When you magnify your vision to take a closer look at the passing figures, you gasp with shock at what you see.</p>

       <p>The city of Oberra is still mourning the death of King Oridon. Its scarlet-and-yellow flags hang at half-mast, and many of its citizens wear black armbands and shawls as visible marks of their respect for the memory of Prince Karvas<ch.apos/> father. As you ride along its paved streets, you see that many of its shops and public buildings bear proclamations announcing the forthcoming crowning of Baron Sadanzo on Harvestmas Day. Most of these notices have either been torn or defaced with black paint, and this cheers Karvas, for it shows that the citizens of this wealthy city do not welcome the prospect of having Baron Sadanzo as their future king.</p>
       <p>It is nearing darkness when you find the residence of Florin Sainus. It is a well-appointed townhouse built on three levels with its own walled garden and stables. You dismount and pull a bell rope that hangs beside its arched door. The Prince<ch.apos/>s aged tutor is overwhelmed with surprise and delight when he opens the door and sees his former pupil standing on the steps before him. The old man ushers you both inside and orders his servants to attend to your horses. Over a reviving meal of steamed fish and oatmeal bread, Karvas recounts the perilous events of the past few weeks which have brought you here to seek his help. Gladly he pledges his assistance, but he cautions you that your time has nearly run out. Carefully he considers the ways by which you could still reach Seroa in time for the crowning, and at length he tells you of two routes. Both offer an equal chance of success.</p>
       <p>The first is the most direct route: the King<ch.apos/>s Highway from Oberra to Seroa. Normally this road would take four days to travel, but there are now only three full days left before Harvestmas, and so you would have to ride hard to make up for the missing day. The second route is partly by road and partly by river. Seventy-five miles due east of Oberra is the hamlet of Xaia. It lies on a bend of the River Seroa and is a boarding point for the boats that carry cargo and travellers along this major waterway. By this route the journey to Seroa can be completed in three days, <quote>assuming that the riverboats are running to schedule,</quote> warns Sainus. <quote>They are the swiftest means of reaching the capital, yet they can be unreliable during spells of bad weather.</quote></p>
       <p>Karvas proposes that you decide which route to take and then leave Oberra at once. <quote>If we commence our journey this night, we may gain a few precious hours that could ensure our success.</quote> You agree with the Prince that you should go at once, but Sainus informs you that it will not be possible for you to leave Oberra until dawn. He tells you that the city council have imposed a curfew during the hours of darkness, following an outbreak of thefts and murders among its prominent citizens. Sainus believes that Baron Sadanzo<ch.apos/>s robber knights are responsible for the crimes, for many have become residents of the city since King Oridon passed away. He fears that they are plotting to overthrow the council and will act as soon as Sadanzo is crowned king.</p>
       <p>In light of the situation, you decide to stay here and rest, and then leave the city at first light. Before you retire, Karvas asks you to decide which route you should use to travel to Seroa.</p>
       <choice idref="sect227">If you wish to travel the King<ch.apos/>s Highway, the road that leads directly from Oberra to Seroa, <link-text>turn to 227</link-text>.</choice>

You can see a log cabin with a veranda, three small sheds, and a picket-fenced enclosure containing goats and chickens. When your senses detect no human presence, you enter the clearing and signal to Acraban to follow as you make your approach towards the cabin.</p>
       <p>From the veranda you can see a second track which descends steeply towards a sandy cove. You intensify your vision and catch sight of a man on the beach who is kneeling beside a stone-covered mound. He has blond shoulder-length hair and he is dressed in breeches and a jerkin made from tanned goat hides. From the descriptions given to you by Lord Zinair, you feel sure that he must be Prince Karvas.</p>

       <p>You rise at dawn and, after a hearty breakfast in the tavern kitchen, you and Karvas collect your horses from the stables. The tavern-keeper and his wife bid you a cheery farewell, and you set off from Voshno along a road that crosses the plain to the east.</p>
       <p>The morning sky is clear and sunny, and the air is filled with butterflies and the sound of bird song. Having now entered Siyen, and with ten days remaining to Harvestmas, you are feeling quietly confident that you will reach Seroa in time for Karvas to be crowned King. To your surprise you find that the Prince is a little less optimistic. He tells you that you are now approaching the western province of Cavalia, a region which shares its name with its principal city. The province and city are ruled by Sadanzo, the evil Baron who seeks to usurp the throne of Siyen. Karvas cautions you to remain vigilant until you are safely beyond the borders of his enemy<ch.apos/>s province.</p>
       <p>It is nearing noon when you first glimpse the towers and spires of Cavalia glinting on the horizon. The plains road leads directly to its fortified gatehouse, but Karvas is anxious to avoid entering the city. He proposes that you leave the road and use a smaller trail which threads through several villages and settlements that ring the city. You are approaching the first of these villages when you see a troop of thirty horsemen riding towards you on the trail ahead. They wear chainmail armour and they each have the emblem of a black eagle<ch.apos/>s head emblazoned upon their white surcoats and shields. A golden crown surmounts these eagle<ch.apos/>s heads and Karvas gasps when he sees them. He signals to you to rein in your horse and, as you come to a halt, he tells you that the approaching horsemen are wearing the livery of Baron Sadanzo. The black eagle<ch.apos/>s head is his mark, but it is the addition of a golden crown that has shocked Karvas. It is the sign of royal ascendance. Karvas is fearful that Baron Sadanzo has already been crowned King of Siyen.</p>
       <p>As they ride nearer, the leader of the troop<ch.emdash/>a Knight Bachelor<ch.emdash/>motions his horsemen to leave the trail and encircle you and the Prince. As they obey his command, the Knight Bachelor brings his snorting steed to a halt alongside your horse.</p>
       <p><quote>Hail, fellow riders,</quote> he says, with forced politeness. He raises the steel visor of his helmet and his dark, suspicious eyes scrutinise you from head to toe.</p>

You are about to enter when suddenly you notice the body of a young boy lying partially buried beneath a heap of straw.

       <p>As the <cite>Starstrider</cite> begins to descend there is a loud explosion. From his nest atop the mainmast, the lookout shouts out a warning and frantically he points towards the ground. You rush to the rail and peer over the side, your stomach churning with fearful anticipation of what you will see. Deep within the fathomless reaches of the fissures and chasms passing below, you glimpse flashes of blue-white energy. These bolts are growing brighter and louder as they streak towards the surface. One bolt escapes from a vent in the middle distance and rips open the sky. It skewers a cluster of steam clouds and blows them apart in a loud and spectacular explosion of gas and flame. You urge Acraban to order his helmsman to ascend, this time to avoid the new and deadly danger that is striking at you from below. The wizard hesitates before turning to Kuo, but before he can issue the counter-order, there is a deafening <onomatopoeia>Crack!</onomatopoeia> from somewhere beneath the stern.</p>

       <p>Using your mastery of Elementalism, you stir up the dirt around the feet of the nearest shrine-bearer and project this cloud of grit at his face. Instinctively he releases his hold of the platform and cups his hands to his stinging eyes. Without his support the platform tilts over and the tiger-head idol tumbles from its wooden base. It hits the cobblestones with a mighty crash, shatters in two, and releases a whirling cone of red flame from its hollow core that engulfs the bearers. In the blink of an eye the four men are transformed into smouldering heaps of ash.</p>

       <p>The morning sky is filled with brooding clouds and the surrounding granite peaks appear hostile and unforgiving, but you draw some comfort from the fact that the rain has ceased and you are able to ride this ancient mountain trail with little difficulty. It is nearing midday when you catch your first glimpse of the wastelands that lie to the east, far beyond the Dammerdon Range. These are the Doomlands of Naaros and your heart fills with dread when you recall something of what you learned about this region during your teachings at the Kai Monastery.</p>
       <p>This vast wasteland of dust and ash was formerly the seat of power of the greatest, most evil being who ever ruled Magnamund<ch.emdash/>Agarash the Damned. At its centre there once stood his mighty fortress-city of Naaros; now all that remains is a titanic chasm of molten lava and heat-fused rock. Ten millennia ago, the gods Ishir and Kai sent forth the magical Elder Magi to challenge the rule of Agarash, and they undertook a daring assault upon Naaros and its fell inhabitants, the Agarashi<ch.emdash/>the Creatures of Darkness. This attack precipitated a war which lasted a thousand years and culminated in the destruction of Agarash and his accursed empire. Once there were many cities and fortresses in the Doomlands; now there are none.</p>
       <p>As you continue along the trail you pass several waystones that are set into the ground at regular intervals. They are not ancient stones for they each bear the symbol of Sejanoz, and your Kai senses detect that these carvings are no more than a decade old. Karvas suspects that Sejanoz has had them placed here as a form of homage to the memory of Agarash. Throughout Southern Magnamund it is rumoured that the spirit of Agarash lives on, imprisoned within the molten ruins of Naaros.</p>

       <p>When the Prince recovers consciousness he can hardly believe his eyes. The chill, spartan surroundings of the chapel have somehow transformed into the warm, rich opulence of Lodamos<ch.apos/> personal chamber. The fearsome ghost of Knight Ranald has disappeared, yet he is now confronted by a sight he finds equally difficult to reconcile: Baron Lodamos happily conversing with you over a plate of roasted pheasant and sweet potatoes! The Baron, upon seeing that the Prince has regained consciousness, goes and kneels at the side of his divan. Carefully he explains all that has occurred since Karvas lost consciousness, and he begs the Prince to forgive him for the ordeal he has been made to suffer. To redress his conduct, the Baron pledges that he will do all he can to help you both reach Seroa in time for the crowning ceremony on Harvestmas Day.</p>

       <p>The smooth surface of the tower wall proves to be a minor obstruction to someone of your ability and you ascend effortlessly, like a spider, towards the second-storey window. On reaching the window you pull yourself through the open frame and drop down onto the steps of a stone stairway beyond. This circular staircase leads to the top of the tower which commands a magnificent view of the city. Aided by your night vision, you are able to locate stables less than a mile to the north of the tower. You commit their location to memory and then hurriedly you descend the stairs and return to the window. Once more you use your climbing skills, this time to make a speedy descent to the street below.</p>
       <p>Prince Karvas is delighted to hear that there are stables in the city, and he insists that you set off for them at once. He is leading the way out of the warehouse ruins when suddenly the tower bell begins to toll once more. Moments later, the temple doors swing open and the procession of black-clad figures file out into the street. Instinctively you take hold of Karvas by the arm and pull him back into the ruins to avoid being seen by the emerging soldiers. As they pass by, you peer around the edge of the crumbling warehouse doorway to watch them. A strange feeling of unease makes the skin on the back of your neck prickle, and immediately you sense that all is not what it seems. When you magnify your vision to take a closer look at the passing figures, you gasp with shock at what you see.</p>

       <p>You stagger painfully to your feet and try to focus on your surroundings. Through a pall of smoke you hear the groans of wounded crewmen and the crackling buzz of electrical arcing. Steam rises from a gaping hole in the stern deck and a fire rages around the base of the mainmast. Prince Karvas emerges unscathed from the rope locker and quickly he helps you to smother this fire. Then he gives first aid to a crewman who is lying nearby, nursing a broken knee. Acraban comes staggering out of the smoke. His robes are torn and a trickle of blood runs from a cut above his right ear. You use your Magnakai Curing skills to heal the wizard<ch.apos/>s wound and then together you help evacuate the injured crewmen from the crippled skyship. Acraban orders Bo<ch.apos/>sun Gora to go and assess the state of the crew. He returns shortly and reports that from the ship<ch.apos/>s original complement of ten men, three are now missing, three are wounded, and one is dead. The remaining three crewmen, himself included, have survived the crash with only minor injuries.</p>

       <p>Using your Magnakai Curing skills, you ease the pain of the badly-injured crewmen before helping Karvas and Gora to bury the dead man<ch.emdash/>Kuo the helmsman. The area surrounding the crashed skyship is thickly wooded and, with night fast approaching and a sky heavy with clouds, it is impossible for you to determine your exact location. Acraban proposes to contact Lord Zinair to inform him of the disaster by means of his seeing stone. But, to his dismay, he soon discovers that the magical artefact has been lost in the crash.</p>
       <p>As the darkness of night envelops the smouldering wreck of the <cite>Starstrider</cite>, you find it hard to suppress a growing sense of despair. It is a mood shared by the other survivors, and few words are exchanged as you work together to erect a makeshift shelter for the wounded beside the ship<ch.apos/>s battered keel.

       <p>The sergeant has his men unchain you from the wall and march you at spear-point along the lower corridors and passages of the citadel, to a small chapel of worship that is dedicated to the Goddess Ishir. You and Karvas are pushed into this chapel and its heavy door is slammed shut and bolted behind you. Moonlight filters into this place of worship through leaded stained glass set into star-shaped alcoves near its vaulted ceiling. It casts a pale rainbow of colour upon a marble tomb which occupies the centre of the chapel floor. Its heavy stone lid is carved in the likeness of a recumbent knight whose hands are folded around the hilt of a broadsword.</p>
       <p>Karvas is about to beat his fist on the bolted door and demand that he be allowed to speak to Dunwayne, but you stay his hand. Your Magnakai Discipline of Divination warns you that you and Karvas are not alone in this chapel. You detect a strong psychic presence that is centred upon the tomb. A sudden gust of wind sweeps through the chapel and you feel the air temperature plummet to near-freezing. Ice crystallises on the sides of the tomb and a ghostly plume of vapour seeps from cracks in the stone. This translucent mist swirls and condenses, and gradually it adopts the recognisable form of a knight in armour clutching the hilt of a broadsword. It is the ghost of the warrior whose remains are entombed here. He is a paladin knight, and his ghost has arisen to test your true purpose. The ghostly warrior raises his mighty sword and rays of eerie blue light flood out from the slits in the visor of his spectral helm. As this light washes over you and Karvas, you feel pulses of psychic energy assaulting your mind. The Prince lets out a scream and then he falls unconscious to the floor as the waves of energy increase in intensity.</p>

       <p>Over the next two days you ride away from Jaroc in a northeasterly direction, crossing a rich expanse of rolling prairie. The riding is easy and the fine weather helps you make good progress. By noon of the third day out of Jaroc you have covered nearly 200 miles and you are feeling in good spirits. The prairie gradually gives way to a region of hilly uplands that lie sandwiched between two mountain ranges. Here you happen upon a rutted track that leaves the prairie and winds through the hills towards a high pass. There are no signposts on this road, but Karvas is familiar with this region and he tells you that it leads to an outpost town called Battle Pass. You are in the land of Lunarlia and for centuries this realm has been the enemy of Siyen<ch.emdash/>Prince Karvas<ch.apos/> homeland. Many wars have been waged between the two kingdoms and this region has seen countless battles. Karvas pledges to end these wars. When he is crowned King of Siyen he vows that he will seek a lasting peace with the kingdom of Lunarlia.</p>
       <p>It is noon and a warm sun is beating down on the fortified town of Battle Pass as you approach its west gate. Karvas is grateful that he is wearing the clothes of a Sommlending journeyman, for the inhabitants of this tough frontier post are notoriously hostile to the Siyenese. To your surprise, the guards at the gate pay you scant attention and you are allowed to enter the town with little more than a cursory glance. You ask Karvas why this is so and he tells you that riders approaching from the west, the Lunarlian side, are allowed to pass freely. Riders from the east, the Siyenese side, are subjected to far greater scrutiny.</p>
       <p>Beyond the west gate a broad avenue opens out into a main square that is bordered by a trading post, a barracks, and a tavern. Both you and Karvas are especially thirsty after your ride through the dry, dusty hills, and you are eager to seek out some refreshment.</p>

       <p>Beyond the arch is a narrow brick walkway which borders the river. You hurry along this unlit footpath until you come to a flight of steps that lead to a flagstoned loading area crowded with soldiers and wagons. By keeping low and moving from one wagon to the next, you and Karvas are able to cross this concourse undetected.</p>
       <p>Soon you come to a stone bridge that traverses the River Tehda. You hurry across and enter a wide avenue which leads to the city<ch.apos/>s east quarter. Grimy two-storey houses of carved hardwood pass by on either side, silent behind their bolts and shutters. At the end of the avenue you almost collide with a patrol of armed guards which is marching towards the river, and hurriedly you are forced to take cover in a timber yard to avoid being seen. You watch the ten-strong patrol as it marches past, and note that these men are clad in black quilted tunics with wide silk leggings, and they are armed with curved swords and hand-axes. They are almond-eyed and they all have shiny black hair tied in a knot at the nape of their necks. Their leader, a stocky bull-necked sergeant, wears the emblem of Sejanoz emblazoned upon a scarlet armband. Patiently you wait for them to reach the river but, when they do, you see another patrol come marching along the avenue from the opposite direction. The east quarter of Bakhasa is a busy place, even at this late hour. Rather than risk being seen and captured, you decide to remain hidden here in the timber yard and attempt to get a few hours<ch.apos/> sleep before dawn.</p>

       <p>The instant the cell door crashes shut, you use your Magnakai Discipline of Nexus to loosen the cords that bind your wrists and then you untie the Prince. The air in this dark prison cell is dank and stifling. What little ventilation there is comes from the narrow crack that runs around the iron cell door. Your advanced Weaponmastery tells you that your Kai Weapon is close by, and when you close your eyes and concentrate, you detect it lying in an empty cell located directly opposite the door of the one you now occupy.</p>
       <p>You vow to Karvas that this foul dungeon will not hold him for long, and you set about examining its walls and floor in the hope of finding a way to escape. However, you quickly discover that you have been locked in the securest cell of the citadel, deep below the ground. Beyond its slimy walls there lies nothing but solid earth. Only the cell door offers a glimmer of hope, yet it has no handle, hinges, or keyhole visible on the inside. It is not secured by a key but by a tumbler lock, similar to the lock of a safe, and it is opened by means of a dial on the outside of the door. Placing your ear to its surface, you use your Magnakai Discipline of Nexus to will the lock tumblers to move. After a few moments you hear them begin to click over.</p>
       <p>You discover the lock has three tumblers. To open the door, each tumbler has to be turned to the correct position in a sequence. Using your Sixth Sense, you determine that the first number in the sequence is equal to the number of horses you took from the Tehda Stables. The second is equivalent to the number of seeing stones that Lord Zinair gave to Wizard Acraban. The third in the sequence is equivalent to the number of additional Grand Master Disciplines acquired upon reaching the rank of Kai Grand Master Superior.</p>

       <p>On reaching the fortress ruins, you dismount and lead your horses through its rubble-strewn main gate. Within its crumbling walls there stands a keep, a cylindrical structure of time-worn masonry. The upper parts have collapsed leaving huge chunks of broken stone heaped around its base. Where once stood a gate of gleaming bronze, now only a blackened hole remains. It provides access to the inner hall and hurriedly you enter to escape from the torrential rain.</p>
       <p>Engravings in the ceiling and walls of this derelict hall tell you that this fortress was once occupied by the Elder Magi. Both you and Karvas are fascinated by the intricate carvings and you decide to split up and explore this hall further. In an alcove at its north side you discover a shrine dedicated to the God Kai. Clumps of wild laumspur are growing around its base and you find that there is enough here for 3 potions. (Each Potion of Laumspur is a Backpack Item. It will restore 4 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points when swallowed after combat)</p>

       <p>You approach to within 100 feet of the west gate by means of a drainage ditch that runs parallel to the rutted road. The heavy iron gate is open but the way through to the city beyond is blocked by four soldiers, each clad in a suit of shiny armour made from lacquered steel scales and hardened leather. They are armed with spears and maces, and their shields display the head of a tiger-like creature with ferocious fangs. It is the emblem of Autarch Sejanoz<ch.emdash/>the ruler of Bhanar.</p>
       <p>Two of the soldiers stand rigidly to attention in the middle of the road with the hafts of their spears crossed to bar entry. Their comrades are seated beside them on benches set into alcoves on either side of the open gateway. A ragged white line appears to have been drawn along the threshold of the gate, but when you magnify your vision you realize that this line is nothing more than a trail of bird droppings. On a tiled ledge above the arch of the gateway you can see a long line of roosting crows. They appear almost invisible against the jet-black stonework of the parapet.</p>
       <p>After watching the guards for several minutes you are sure that they are all alert and observant. It would be difficult to get past these men without their knowledge. If you are to gain entry to the city by this route, first you will have to create a diversion to draw away these vigilant guards.</p>

Seconds later you detect the danger; it is a concealed pit which bisects the track a few yards ahead.

You warn Acraban of its position and motion him to leave the trail and skirt around this hidden trap. He obeys, but within moments you detect a second pit hidden amongst the undergrowth. You hiss a warning to Acraban to halt just as he is about to step upon it.</p>

       <p>You hide the guard<ch.apos/>s body among some long grasses at the base of the perimeter wall and then hurry across the field to a courtyard located near to the main entrance. This flagstoned yard abuts the entrance gates and is bounded on the other three sides by paddocks, tack rooms, and the training fields. There are only two guards on duty here, the others having been called upon to assist the patrols that are out searching the city. They are both asleep at their posts and you have no difficulty tiptoeing past them and entering the paddocks where the horses are stabled.</p>
       <p>You search the stalls and soon discover two black Bhanarian stallions of magnificent quality and breeding. They will make ideal mounts for you and Prince Karvas. These intelligent animals respond readily to your Magnakai Discipline of Animal Control and they remain calm and composed as you hurriedly fix their saddles and bridles. As you are leading them out into the courtyard, you stop to unbuckle a sword belt from the belly of a sleeping guard. Prince Karvas is unarmed and you are sure he will appreciate this weapon more than its present owner.</p>
       <p>You lead the horses across the courtyard and as you approach the stables<ch.apos/> main doors, you mount one of them and fix the reins of the other to your stirrup. Then you kick open one of the double doors and urge your horse forward at the gallop.</p>
       <p>The guards outside are taken completely by surprise. As they fumble to unsheathe their swords, you race across the square and wave to Karvas who his waiting patiently for your signal. The Prince leaps up from behind the cart and comes running towards the spare horse. He is getting ready to leap into its saddle when a gruff cry alerts you to danger. A patrol has entered the square and their officer is commanding his sergeant to fire at you with his bow.</p>

       <p>Normally these two fops would blanch and faint in the face of such a threat, but a night spent drinking at the tavern has filled them with liquid courage.

       <p>Once you have decided the places where each of you will search for the whereabouts of Prince Karvas, you follow Acraban to the rear deck and enter the skyship<ch.apos/>s boarding cage. Swiftly it is winched down to the market square where you are met unexpectedly by a pressing crowd of grimy-faced street urchins. They have been gathering here since dawn to stare in wonderment at the <cite>Starstrider</cite> hovering motionless in the cloudless sky above. Acraban scatters a handful of copper coins across the cobblestones and the children scramble to retrieve them. This creates enough room to allow Zinair to open the cage door and the three of you to step out. After agreeing to return here to the skyship no later than sunset, you split up and go in search of your chosen destinations.</p>
       <p>Unlike the urchins, the adult population of Mydnight appears less than fascinated by the imposing sight of the <cite>Starstrider</cite> hovering above their city. Few pay it a second glance, yet this seeming lack of interest does not surprise you. For centuries this port has been a refuge for exiles from the many nations of Magnamund who, for their own individual reasons, have chosen to forsake their native lands. They are, by nature, a secretive community. Any overt interest in the affairs of another is most often viewed with suspicion and distrust.</p>
       <p>You retrace the route you took last night and soon find yourself at the harbour. <cite>The Azaktana</cite> is still moored at the quayside and you give the crew a friendly wave as you stride across the quayside and enter a wide avenue that leads to the Hall of the Judicars.</p>
       <p>By the lowly standards of the city, this hall could almost be considered grand in comparison to the neighbouring hovels. You pass beneath its fa<ch.ccedil/>ade of crumbling marble and walk through a stone archway that leads to a gloomy, torchlit interior. Here you discover over a hundred men and women standing patiently in two separate queues. One line ends at an open window where a clerk is busily exchanging gold and silver coins for linen Torqs, the woven currency that is used here on Sheasu. The other queue ends at a marble-topped desk where a man in the uniform of a reeve-sergeant is listening with bored indifference to a citizen who is reporting the theft of a goat.</p>

       <p>It is an hour past midnight and the passing of another day rekindles thoughts of the road ahead. With only nineteen days to Harvestmas, the city of Seroa still seems a very long way away. But you draw some comfort from the fact that you now have two fine stallions. They are sure to make the long road seem far shorter. You are admiring them when suddenly they stop drinking and become agitated. You scan the surrounding trees yet you detect nothing untoward. Then you hear the sound of approaching hoofbeats and you curse yourself for being complacent.</p>
       <p><quote>I should have known they would not let us get away with two horses as fine as these,</quote> you say, as hurriedly you and Karvas climb back into the saddle. You urge your horses across the ford and, as you take to the trail beyond, you look over your shoulder to see half a dozen armed Bakhasians come galloping along the trail towards the stream. They are led by a warrior who is sheathed from head to toe in shiny black armour and he holds a metal staff raised in his gauntleted hand. Beyond the stream the trail narrows as it ascends into the forested hills.</p>
       <p>As you reach the crest of a ridge, you glance back to see that your pursuers are gaining on you. The leader aims his staff and a ball of flame hurtles from its tip to come streaking between you and the Prince. This fiery missile fails to strike its target, but the heat and noise of its passing startles Karvas<ch.apos/> horse. The Prince controls his mount with admirable skill, yet in so doing he loses speed and is soon left trailing over 100 yards behind. You wave to him, urging him frantically to catch up, and he signals to you to ride on. When you turn to look at the trail ahead, you are shocked to see that it is now blocked by a burning tree. The fiery missile has struck and felled a pine and ignited its inflammable sap. As you gallop towards this blazing trunk, your heart sinks when you see that it blocks the narrow trail: there is no clear way around it.</p>

       <p>Karvas buckles on his sword belt and, before you leave, he unhooks a coil of rope from the wall and slings it over his shoulder. On returning to the corridor, you hurry to the end to where a circular stone staircase ascends to the levels above. With your Kai Weapon back in your hand once more, you begin to climb the steps, retracing the route that you committed to your memory when you were dragged to your cell more than an hour ago.</p>

       <p>As the soldier approaches you realize that he is only aware of Prince Karvas. You have not been seen; the darkness and your innate Kai camouflage skills have kept you hidden from sight. Silently you sidestep into the shallow archway of an adjacent house and unsheathe your Kai Weapon. Karvas stands in the avenue, his eyes fixed on the approaching guard so as not to betray your presence. Nervously the soldier approaches the Prince with his spear levelled at his chest. He commands Karvas to state the name of his regiment, and when he refuses to reply, your Sixth Sense suddenly warns you that the guard is about to raise the alarm.</p>
       <p>Like an attacking panther, you leap from the shadowy arch and strike the guard at the base of the neck with the hilt of your weapon. Without uttering a sound he crumples at the knees and falls unconscious to the ground. Quickly you and Karvas drag his body away from the avenue and hide it in an alleyway. Before you leave, you make a quick search of the soldier<ch.apos/>s pockets and backpack and discover the following items:</p>
       <ul>
        <li>30 Ren (equivalent to 3 Gold Crowns)</li>
        <li>Spear</li>
        <li>Sword</li>
        <li>Dagger</li>
        <li>Bottle of Rice Wine</li>
        <li>1 Meal</li>
        <li>Ivory Comb</li>
       </ul>
       <p>If you wish to keep any of these items, adjust your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a> accordingly.</p>
       <p>You hurry away from the alley and continue along the avenue, past grimy two-storey houses of carved hardwood that are silent behind their bolts and shutters. It leads to a stone bridge that traverses the River Tehda and then continues into the heart of the east quarter. Here you almost collide with a patrol of armed guards which is marching towards the river, and hurriedly you are forced to take cover in a timber yard to avoid being seen. You observe the ten-strong patrol as it marches past. These men are clad in black quilted tunics and wide silk leggings, and they are armed with curved swords and hand-axes. All are almond-eyed and they have shiny black hair tied in a knot at the nape of their necks. Their leader, a stocky bull-necked sergeant, wears the emblem of Sejanoz emblazoned upon a scarlet armband. Patiently you wait for them to reach the bridge but, as they do so, another patrol comes marching along the avenue from the opposite direction. The east quarter of Bakhasa is a busy place even at this late hour. Rather than risk being seen and captured, you decide to remain hidden in the timber yard and attempt to get a few hours<ch.apos/> sleep before dawn.</p>

       <p><quote>Expect no help from that quarter,</quote> replies Karvas, coolly. <quote>During my time in Mydnight I heard many stories about Bakhasa and its ruler<ch.emdash/>the Imperial Autarch Sejanoz. They were all chilling tales. They say it<ch.apos/>s a cruel and evil place<ch.emdash/>a city without a soul where human life counts for little.

       <p>The Prince proposes to set off for Seroa on foot.

The fearful noise is almost deafening, yet it fails to awaken Karvas who is sleeping deeply after yesterday<ch.apos/>s tiring trek.

       <p>You swim to the edge of the moat and drag yourself out of the stinking water. As you take hold of the Prince<ch.apos/>s hand and haul him out onto the bank, you see a group of horsemen riding across the drawbridge. Most are armed with lances bearing Sadanzo<ch.apos/>s eagle<ch.apos/>s-head pennant, and their red-faced leader is shouting and pointing at you with his sword.</p>

       <p>Arrows continue to fall. They thud into the muddy rim of the moat and splinter on the paved road that encircles the citadel. You grab Karvas by his cloak and pull him to his feet. It is too dangerous to stay here a moment longer. On the far side of the paved road you can see a row of boarded-up houses, an alleyway, and a baker<ch.apos/>s shop.</p>

       <p>Desperately you attempt to dodge the tip of your enemy<ch.apos/>s lance, but your reflexes have been dulled by the shock of your fall and you react too slowly to avoid being hit.

       <p>You launch a sharp pulse of psychic energy at the Inquisitor-major<ch.apos/>s mind which leaves him reeling (deduct 1 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> point for the use of this Discipline). He drops his accursed hunting horn and lolls drunkenly in his saddle before the pain in his mind dissolves and his senses return. He fears that you are a powerful sorcerer and, with a look of abject terror in his eyes, he orders his hunting party to return at once to the foothills. Blindly he wheels his mount about, trampling and crushing his horn beneath his horse<ch.apos/>s hooves in his desperation to get away.</p>
       <p>As the hunters gallop off across the plain, towards the distant horizon, you use your Magnakai Curing skills to revive Prince Karvas fully before you continue your ride east towards Varedo.</p>

       <p>You draw an Arrow to your Bow and let it fly towards the nearest shrine-bearer. The shaft buries itself in his chest and the force of its impact knocks him to the ground. As he releases his grip of the platform, it tilts over and the tiger-head idol tumbles from its wooden base. It hits the ground with a mighty crash, breaks in two, and releases a whirling cone of red flame from its hollow core that engulfs the remaining bearers. In the blink of an eye the three men are transformed into smouldering heaps of ash.</p>

       <p>Cries of fear and outrage echo along the street as the Bakhasian soldiers witness the deaths of their comrades and the destruction of their unholy symbol. Before they can gather themselves and give chase, you and Karvas rush across the street and make a hasty escape along the dark alleyway beyond.</p>

       <p>The blacksmith pockets your bribe and bids you follow him to a smaller room at the rear of his workshop. In the quiet privacy of this adjoining room he tells you all he knows about Prince Karvas of Siyen.</p>
       <p><quote>The Prince don<ch.apos/>t live here in Mydnight,</quote> he says. <quote>He did once, when he first came to Sheasu<ch.ellips/>that be ten years ago now. Then this woman arrived and they got wed. He took her up-country. They live up there on the north coast somewhere. They rarely visits Mydnight these days. Fact is, I haven<ch.apos/>t seen them for more than a year.</quote></p>
       <p>You thank the blacksmith for the information and leave his workshop. On returning to the quayside you resolve to explore the tangle of alleyways that make up the city<ch.apos/>s eastern quarter in the hope of finding someone else who is willing to tell or sell what they know about the Prince. Unfortunately your efforts garner no further information. As the sun begins to settle on the horizon, you finally abandon your search and hurry back through the darkening passageways towards the market square.</p>
       <p>Wizard Acraban and Lord Zinair are already waiting aboard the <cite>Starstrider</cite> by the time you reach the square. The magician orders the boarding cage to be lowered and you are winched up to the skyship. Both are anxious to hear your news of Prince Karvas<ch.apos/> whereabouts for their own enquiries have yielded little useful information. You inform them of what you have learned<ch.emdash/>that the Prince has a wife and they are living somewhere on the island<ch.apos/>s northern coastline. Lord Zinair has discovered that Amarelda is the name of Karvas<ch.apos/> wife, and Acraban has learned that they last visited Mydnight exactly a year ago.</p>
       <p><quote>You have done well, Grand Master,</quote> says Lord Zinair. <quote>The citizens of this city are a secretive breed, yet you may have prised enough from them to help us find our reclusive Siyenese Prince.</quote> Turning to Acraban, he says: <quote>I propose we travel north at first light and commence a search of the northern shoreline. It will be easier to espy his retreat from the air than to attempt a search by land.</quote></p>
       <p>Acraban nods in agreement and passes word to his young crewmen to prepare the <cite>Starstrider</cite> for a voyage north at first light.</p>

       <p>Congratulations, Grand Master. Your mission is complete. In the face of great adversity you have met the challenge and you have triumphed. You have upheld the highest traditions of the Kai with honour and dignity, and you have displayed exceptional strength and bravery throughout your ordeal. The succession of Karvas is an important victory in the war against Evil, for it has prevented the throne of Siyen, Sommerlund<ch.apos/>s richest ally, from falling into the hands of an agent of Naar. You have earned the respect of the Siyenese people and they will never forget the debt of gratitude they owe you.</p>
       <p>Following the celebration of his succession, King Karvas arranges for you to return home to Sommerlund by sea aboard his royal caravel. The voyage is swift and uneventful, yet upon reaching Holmgard you learn of a new and deadly threat that has arisen to challenge the Kai. If you wish to confront this threat, the nature of the challenge will be revealed in the next exciting <cite>Lone Wolf New Order</cite> adventure, entitled:</p>
