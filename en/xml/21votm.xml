     <p>You are a Kai Grand Master of the New Order of the Kai<ch.emdash/>the warrior <ch.eacute/>lite of Sommerlund.</p>

     <p>It is the year MS<ch.nbsp/>5083 and thirty-three years have passed since the First Order of the Kai was almost wiped out by the Darklords of Helgedad. These champions of evil, who were sent by the Dark God Naar to destroy your fertile world of Magnamund, have since been destroyed. The leader of your illustrious fighting order<ch.emdash/>the legendary warrior Lone Wolf<ch.emdash/>was the sole survivor of the First Order of the Kai, and as a young initiate he had stood amid the burning wreckage of the old Kai Monastery and had vowed to avenge the massacre of his comrades. In the year MS<ch.nbsp/>5070 he was to keep his pledge when alone he infiltrated the foul domain of the Darklords and destroyed the base of their power<ch.emdash/>the infernal city of Helgedad.</p>

     <p>With the fall of Helgedad, chaos befell the Darkland armies who had, until then, been poised to conquer all of Magnamund. Quickly their disorder escalated into a mutinous civil war which allowed the Freeland armies of Magnamund time in which to recover and launch a successful counter-offensive. Against all odds, a swift and total victory was secured over the feuding armies of evil.</p>

     <p>Following the demise of the Darklords, peace reigned in your homeland of Sommerlund. Under the direction of Lone Wolf the ruined Monastery of the Kai was rebuilt and restored to its former glory, and the raising of a New Order of Kai warriors was swiftly reestablished. You are one of this new generation of Kai recruits. You were born in Sommerlund in the year MS<ch.nbsp/>5063, during the era of war against the Darklords, and you were sent by your father to the Kai Monastery at the age of seven to develop your martial skills and the latent Kai abilities which lie dormant in some Sommlending. During the years that followed, your skills were nurtured and honed to perfection by long hours of study and rigorous training. Your exceptional talent helped you to master all of the Kai and Magnakai Disciplines and you rose swiftly through the ranks of the New Order to become one of only five who now hold the high rank of Kai Grand Master. It is an achievement which has brought great honour upon you and your family.</p>

     <p>In the year MS<ch.nbsp/>5077 your skill and courage were put to the test when an attack was launched upon the Kai Monastery during Lone Wolf<ch.apos/>s absence. By means of a Shadow Gate (an astral corridor between the physical world of Sommerlund and the many ethereal domains which lie beyond it) the Dark God sent forth a host of dragon-creatures to besiege the monastery and lay waste to all Sommerlund. He had chosen his time well, yet his evil plan was thwarted by the tenacious defence that you and your brethren maintained until the siege was raised by Lone Wolf and the King<ch.apos/>s Army of Sommerlund.</p>

     <p>The defeat of his minions enraged the Dark God and inflamed his lust for vengeance. Three years later he created and sent to Sommerlund an evil champion called <quote>Wolf<ch.apos/>s Bane</quote> who was the very image of Lone Wolf. While your leader was engaged upon a quest overseas, this impostor terrorized your homeland in his guise and sought to destroy the reputation and the honour of the Kai. He would have succeeded had not Lone Wolf returned home and pursued this enemy to an ancient necropolis in the Sommlending city of Tyso. There, deep within a subterranean crypt, he and his evil alter-ego were drawn through a Shadow Gate to the Plane of Darkness<ch.emdash/>Naar<ch.apos/>s stronghold<ch.emdash/>where a deadly duel ensued. Lone Wolf vanquished the foe and discovered that Naar had in his possession the fabled Moonstone of the Shianti. This wondrous artefact was created many thousands of years ago by the god-like Shianti, whose presence upon Magnamund had heralded the dawn of humanity. This stone of power contains the combined might of all their magic and wisdom, the sum of all their knowledge. So significant was the creation of this stone that all time on Magnamund has since been measured from the date of its creation. It had long been held that the Moonstone<ch.apos/>s location was a secret known only to the remnants of the Shianti, who dwell upon the mysterious Isle of Lorn in Southern Magnamund, yet the evidence of Lone Wolf<ch.apos/>s eyes had told him that this mystical artefact had somehow fallen into the hands of Naar.</p>

     <p>Lone Wolf realized that the Dark God had been using its legendary powers to generate Shadow Gates within the world of Magnamund, at locations and times of his own choosing. Such power had enabled him to send his loathsome champions to your home world, while the forces of the Gods of Good, Kai and Ishir, had been held at bay. Only Lone Wolf and the New Order of the Kai had stood in the way of the onslaught of Naar<ch.apos/>s agents since the demise of the Darklords.</p>

     <p>Lone Wolf successfully escaped from the Plane of Darkness and returned to Sommerlund, yet he knew that the fight against Evil had not been won outright. He realized that he would have to return to the Plane of Darkness and retrieve the fabled Moonstone. Only by doing so would Magnamund truly be safe from Naar<ch.apos/>s legions of darkness. Two years ago, with the aid of his most trusted ally, Lord Rimoah of Dessi, Lone Wolf fulfilled his vow by journeying to the Dark God<ch.apos/>s domain and retrieving the Moonstone of the Shianti. Upon his triumphant return, Lone Wolf placed the Moonstone in the Vault of the Sun<ch.emdash/>his personal chamber located deep below the fortified citadel of the Kai Monastery. He had hoped that the fabled artefact could remain there indefinitely, to be guarded by generations of Kai who would keep it secure from Naar<ch.apos/>s minions. Retrieval of the Moonstone had denied the Dark God<ch.apos/>s champions ready access to Magnamund, yet Lone Wolf knew that there were many lesser agents of Naar upon Magnamund waiting quietly in the shadows for the chance to do his evil bidding. Undoubtedly they would stop at nothing to retrieve the Moonstone for their fell master.</p>

     <p>Within a year of his return home it became clear to Lone Wolf that his wish could not be fulfilled. At first the presence of the Moonstone seemed greatly beneficial to Sommerlund. Crops grew abundantly, incidence of disease and illness became increasingly rare, and the newly-born were uniformly healthy. Even the offspring of the impoverished who, in normal times, could expect only one in three of their infants to survive longer than a month after birth, were all in good health and exceptional in their physical and mental development. The Sommlending called this extraordinary period of providence <quote>the Blessing of the Moonstone</quote>, yet this time of good fortune could not last. The power of the Moonstone was a great force for Good, but it was also greatly disruptive of the natural order of Magnamund. Soon death itself became a rarity in Sommerlund, and the four seasons of the year were slowly transformed into one unending spring. Lone Wolf was deeply concerned at the changes wrought by the Moonstone and sought the counsel of his closest friend<ch.emdash/>Guildmaster Banedon, leader of Sommerlund<ch.apos/>s Brotherhood of Magicians. Banedon entreated him to relinquish the Moonstone before the effects of its power became irreversible. To right the balance of nature the Moonstone would have to be taken to the Isle of Lorn, in the southernmost reaches of Magnamund, and delivered back into the hands of the Shianti. Only they, its creators, could prevent its powers from disrupting the natural order of your world.</p>

     <p>Lone Wolf agreed with Banedon<ch.emdash/>the Moonstone would have to be returned to the Shianti. The physical effects of its presence were beginning to attract the unwelcome attentions of those who secretly sought to enact Naar<ch.apos/>s revenge upon the Kai. When one of Naar<ch.apos/>s agents was captured by a Kai patrol within a few miles of the monastery, Lone Wolf felt he could wait no longer. He resolved to act immediately. Preparations were made for a long journey and, especially among the lower ranks of the Kai, rumours were rife that Lone Wolf himself would take responsibility for carrying the Moonstone to the Shianti. Indeed, this speculation seemed to be confirmed as fact when it was discovered that he had secured the use of Guildmaster Banedon<ch.apos/>s famous flying ship<ch.emdash/><cite>Cloud-dancer</cite>.</p>

     <p>It therefore came as a shock when, early one morning, you were summoned unexpectedly to the Vault of the Sun. In strictest confidence, Supreme Master Lone Wolf informed you that he had decided to entrust you with the task of taking the Moonstone to the Shianti. The elaborate preparation he was undertaking was simply a diversion, a bluff designed to draw attention away from the vital mission that he wished to entrust to you<ch.emdash/>the most talented and courageous of his Kai Grand Masters.</p>

     <p>You keep a record of your adventure on the <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
     <p>During the years you have spent in training at the Kai Monastery, you have devoted yourself to further developing your fighting prowess (<typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ>) and physical stamina (<typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ>). Before you begin this <cite>New Order</cite> adventure you need to measure how effective your training has been. To do this take a pencil and, with your eyes closed, point the blunt end of it onto the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a>. If you pick a 0 it counts as zero.</p>
     <p>The first number that you pick from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> in this way represents your <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ>. Add 25 to the number you picked and write the total in the <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> section of your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a> (i.e. if your pencil fell on the number 7 in the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> you would write in a <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> of 32). When you fight, your <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> will be pitted against that of your enemy. A high score in this section is therefore desirable.</p>
     <p>The second number that you pick from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> represents your powers of <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ>. Add 30 to this number and write the total in the <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> section of your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a> (i.e. if your pencil fell on the number 8 on the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> you would have 38 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points).</p>
     <p>If you are wounded in combat you will lose <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points. If at any time your <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points fall to zero or below, you are dead and the adventure is over. Lost <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points can be regained during the course of the adventure, but your number of <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points cannot rise above the number you have when you start an adventure.</p>
     <p><strong>Playing Tip:</strong> You may use a 10-sided die instead of the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> if you find it more convenient.</p>

       <p>It has long been the tradition of your <ch.eacute/>lite warrior caste to bestow a new name upon each young novice when they complete their first year<ch.apos/>s training at the Kai Monastery. Kai names are chosen by senior Kai Masters with the aim of reflecting the individual strengths and qualities of each novice.</p>
       <p>You may create your own Kai name for yourself, or you can generate a Kai name at random using the name tables below. To generate a Kai name, pick a number from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> and consult Table A. The name which corresponds to the number you have picked is the first part, or prefix, of your Kai name. Now pick a second number from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> and consult Table B. The name which corresponds to the number you have picked is the second part, or suffix, of your Kai name. Put the prefix and the suffix together and you have your own personal Kai name.</p>

         <p>Following in the footsteps of Lone Wolf himself, you have vowed that one day you will become totally proficient in all 16 of the New Order Kai Grand Master Disciplines. By doing so successfully you will share with Lone Wolf the responsibility, the honour, and the future glory of leading the New Order Kai as a Supreme Master.</p>

         <p>Your present rank of Kai Grand Master Senior means that you have mastered <em>five</em> of the New Order Grand Master Disciplines listed below.

The correct use of a New Order Grand Master Discipline at the right time could save your life. When you have chosen your five Disciplines, enter them in the Grand Master Disciplines section of your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>.</p>

         <p>Upon reaching the ultimate rank of Kai Supreme Master, Lone Wolf received as a reward from the God Kai many new skills and abilities. One of these skills was Kai Weaponcraft. Using his newfound mastery, Lone Wolf forged ten weapons of magical power in the armoury furnaces of the Kai Monastery. These magical weapons are reserved for the <ch.eacute/>lite of the New Order Kai who attain the rank of Grand Master.</p>

         <p>In recognition of your rank and achievement, you may choose your own Kai Weapon from the table below or, if you prefer, you can generate one at random. To generate a Kai Weapon, pick a number from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> and consult the first column. The magical Axe, Sword, or Broadsword which corresponds to the number you have picked will be your own personal Kai Weapon. Record this magical weapon and its unique properties in the Kai Weapon section of the <a idref="action">Special Items List</a>.</p>

         <p><strong>Example</strong></p>
         <p>Say you choose the number 8 from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a>, your Kai Weapon will be the Broadsword <quote>Illuminatus</quote>.</p>

         <p>When using this Kai Weapon in normal combat you may add <ch.plus/>5 points to your <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ>. Each Kai Weapon has a unique property. When you use your Kai Weapon in combat against the type of enemy that matches its unique property, or use it at the optimum time or location, then you may add the higher bonus to your <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> (these bonuses are not cumulative).</p>

         <p><strong>Example</strong></p>
         <p>If you were to use <quote>Illuminatus</quote> in combat against an enemy in an underground cavern, cave, or tunnel, you could add the higher bonus of 7 to your <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ>. If you were to fight this enemy in any other location, the bonus to your <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> would remain at 5.</p>

            <p>In order to use a Bow you must possess a Quiver and at least one Arrow. Each time the Bow is used, erase an Arrow from your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>.

       <p>There will be occasions during your adventure when you will have to fight an enemy. The enemy<ch.apos/>s <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> and <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points are given in the text. Your aim in the combat is to kill the enemy by reducing his <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points to zero while losing as few <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points as possible yourself.</p>
       <p>At the start of a combat, enter your own and the enemy<ch.apos/>s <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points in the appropriate boxes on the Combat Record section of your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
       <p>The sequence for combat is as follows:</p>
       <ol class="paragraphed">
        <li><p>Add any extra points gained through your Grand Master Disciplines and Special Items to your current <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> total.</p></li>
        <li>
         <p>Subtract the <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> of your enemy from this total. The result is your Combat Ratio. Enter it on the <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
         <p>Example</p>
         <p>You, Grand Master (<typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> 32), are attacked in a forest by a pack of Wild Dogs (<typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> 31). You are taken by surprise and are not given the opportunity of evading their attack. You possess the Grand Master Discipline of Kai-surge to which the Wild Dogs are not immune, so you add 8 points to your <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ>. You also possess the Kai Weapon <quote>Ulnarias</quote>, so you add an additional 5 points to your <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ>. This gives you a total <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> of 45.</p>
         <p>You now subtract the Wild Dogs<ch.apos/> <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> from your own, giving a Combat Ratio of <ch.plus/>14 (45<ch.minus/>31=<ch.plus/>14). <ch.plus/>14 is noted on your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a> as the Combat Ratio.</p>
        </li>
        <li><p><a id="stage3">When you have your Combat Ratio</a>, pick a number from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a>.</p></li>
        <li>
         <p>Turn to the <a idref="crtable">Combat Results Table</a>. Along the top of the chart are shown the Combat Ratio numbers. Find the number that is the same as your Combat Ratio and cross-reference it with the random number that you have picked (the random numbers appear on the side of the chart). You now have the number of <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points lost by both yourself and your enemy in this round of combat. (E represents points lost by the enemy; GM represents points lost by yourself<ch.emdash/>Grand Master.)</p>
         <p>Example</p>
         <p>The Combat Ratio between you and the Wild Dogs has been established as <ch.plus/>14. If the number picked from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> is 1, then the result of the first round of combat is:</p>
         <ul>
          <li>You (GM) lose 3 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points (plus an additional 1 point for using Kai-surge. This loss is in addition to the loss suffered as a result of combat).</li>
          <li>Wild Dogs lose 9 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points.</li>
         </ul>
        </li>
        <li><p>On the <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>, mark the changes in <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points to the participants in the combat.</p></li>
        <li><p>Unless otherwise instructed, or unless you have an option to evade, the next round of combat now starts.</p></li>
        <li><p>Repeat the sequence from <a idref="stage3">Stage 3</a>.</p></li>
       </ol>

       <p>This process of combat continues until the <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points of either your enemy or yourself are reduced to zero or below, at which point that combatant is declared dead. If you are declared dead, the adventure is over. If the enemy is dead, you can proceed but with your <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points possibly reduced.</p>

         <p>During your adventure you may be given the chance to evade combat. If you have already engaged in a round of combat and decide to evade, calculate the combat for that round in the usual manner. All points lost by the enemy as a result of that round are ignored, and you make your escape. Only <strong>you</strong> may lose <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points during that round (such is the risk of turning tail and running away during combat!). You may only evade if the text of the particular section allows you to do so.</p>

     <p>You are about to embark upon the first stage of an essential mission to return the fabled Moonstone of the Shianti to its creators.</p>

     <p>Some of the material items that you will encounter during your quest will be of use to you, while others may be red herrings of no real value at all. If you discover items, be selective in what you choose to keep.</p>

     <p>Pick your five Disciplines with care for a wise choice will enable any player to complete the quest, no matter how weak their initial <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> and <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> scores may be. Successful completion of previous <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> adventures (Books 1<ch.endash/>20) is not essential for the completion of this <cite>New Order</cite> adventure.</p>

     <p>May the light of the Gods Kai and Ishir guide you during your vital quest.</p>

     <p>For Sommerlund and the Kai!</p>

       <p><quote>Understand that your mission must be conducted with the utmost secrecy to ensure its success,</quote> says Lone Wolf, fixing you with his steely gaze. You nod your head in acknowledgement and watch with growing anticipation as the Supreme Master of the Kai rises from his throne and moves silently across the polished stone floor of his magnificent vault. From a concealed safe in the granite wall he removes a seemingly plain leather satchel which he unbuckles and holds open, inviting your inspection. Nestled within lies the legendary Moonstone, surrounded by a shimmering halo of golden light.</p>
       <p><quote>The inner lining of this bag is woven from strands of fine-spun korlinium,</quote> says Lone Wolf, as he carefully buckles the satchel<ch.apos/>s leather flap.</p>
       <p><quote>The mineral will hide the Moonstone<ch.apos/>s powerful energies, especially from those who have no need to rely solely upon their eyesight to detect its power.</quote></p>
       <p>He offers you the satchel and you accept it with trembling hands. Yet the moment you touch the bag you feel all your anxieties suddenly vanish and the natural air of calm confidence, for which you are noted among your brother Kai, swiftly returns. (Record the Moonstone on your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a> as a Special Item. You carry it slung over your shoulder in its leather satchel.) Lone Wolf informs you that you are to journey 2,000 miles to Elzian<ch.emdash/>the principal city of the jungle realm of Dessi. There you are to seek out Lord Rimoah at the Tower of Truth. He will assist your onward passage to the Isle of Lorn. In the interests of secrecy, Rimoah is the only other person who knows about your mission. Lone Wolf has arranged for you to travel aboard a Sommlending trading ship, sailing out of Holmgard for Bisutan by way of Barrakeesh. You will be met in Barrakeesh by Lord-lieutenant Fernant, the Sommlending envoy to Vassagonia, who will join you on the voyage to Bisutan where his rank and reputation will help speed the final leg of your journey to Elzian. To allay suspicion you will travel in the guise of a Kai journeyman. At the same time, as you embark upon your long voyage south, so Lone Wolf will leave the monastery aboard the skyship <cite>Cloud-dancer</cite> and journey to distant Lencia, in the far west of Magnamund. He shall carry with him a replica of the Moonstone to draw away the attention of any who would seek to thwart your true quest.</p>
       <p>Upon concluding your briefing, Lone Wolf orders you to go to your quarters and rest. You are to return to the vault at midnight in full readiness to begin the mission.</p>

       <p>You usher the marines into your room and lock the door to prevent the tavern-keeper from entering. Then, one by one, you leave by the window and climb up onto the roof. Hidden by the darkness and by a low parapet wall which encircles the tavern<ch.apos/>s upper floor, you stay here and observe as more than a hundred City Guardsmen round up all the foreign merchants and crewmen who are lodging at the quayside taverns. These innocent men are then made to form a long column before they are marched away towards the Funtal<ch.apos/>s castle. When dawn breaks over the harbour, this normally busy trading centre is unusually quiet. The only people you can see going about their business are native Bir Rabalonians.</p>
       <p>When you can no longer see any City Guardsmen in the harbour, you re-enter the tavern and hurry down to the taproom. Here you find Kol, the Casiornian merchant, enjoying a large plateful of meat and cheese. With a wide grin he tells you that he has spent a very comfortable night hiding in the kitchen cellar.</p>

She falters but she does not abandon her attack, and quickly you raise your weapon in readiness to receive it.</p>

       <p>With the help of your Kai skills and the failing light, you slip away from the <cite>Desert Jewel</cite> and return to the Tradewind Tavern. Here you are fortunate to discover the three marines who, despite their best efforts this day, have been unable to sell your horse and raise enough money to leave. They are surprised to see you come walking through the door, but very glad that you have returned. Oswin tells you that a curfew has been declared and that all foreigners have been forbidden to use the streets after dark. The tavern-keeper, who openly hates the Funtal, offers to hide you in the stables tonight in case the City Guard should pay another visit. Gratefully you accept his offer and spend the night hiding in his hay-loft.</p>

       <p>With a rousing cheer, the second wave of enemy raiders follow their leader and leap aboard <cite>The Pride of Sommerlund</cite>. The ship<ch.apos/>s crew and the marines have suffered many casualties and they are now too weak and exhausted to be able to repel this renewed assault. You know that you must act swiftly if you are to avert a disaster.</p>
       <p>Steeling yourself for what must be done, you shoulder your Bow and unsheathe a weapon. Then you leap from the rigging as the enemy leader passes below the mainmast. You hit the armoured warrior feet-first and slam him to the deck, but he quickly recovers from your surprise attack and, in the ensuing struggle, he manages to kick the weapon from your hand.</p>
       <p><quote>Leave him to me!</quote> he screams, warning off his henchmen who are poised to rush forward and cut you down. Slowly he unsheathes his scimitar and, with a sneer fixed to his cruel lips, he raises the blade in readiness to strike a mighty blow to your head.</p>

       <p>You tour the market and one stall in particular holds your attention. It is run by a small and timid-looking man and he offers you herbs and potions which he has gathered from all over Magnamund. As you examine the hundreds of phials, philtres, and flasks that are laid out upon his stall, you notice there are many types of herbs that you have encountered before, and some you have not. Of all his selection, the following four interest you the most:</p>
       <ul>
        <li>Potion of Laumspur: restores 4 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points when swallowed after combat.</li>
        <li>Potion of Alether: increases <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> by 2 when swallowed before combat (one use only).</li>
        <li>Potion of Mustow: creates a foul choking gas when released into the air.</li>
        <li>Potion of Sebaris: purifies contaminated water (one use only).</li>

       <p>However, by drawing upon your Magnakai skill of Divination you are able to make telepathic contact with Sligh. By way of mental commands and suggestions you tell him to lead his comrades back to Bir Rabalou where they are to sell their horses to raise the money they will need to buy passage home aboard a trading ship. Sligh is unable to answer you telepathically, but you sense that he will comply with your suggestions. Wary of the risk of further landslides, you turn your horse around and ride off along the open mountain trail towards the south.</p>

       <p>You evade your enemies by scaling the mainmast as swiftly as you can. As you climb higher, you notice chunks of wood are raining down from above. You glance up and see that the giant spider is now perched in the crow<ch.apos/>s nest, where it is busily tearing at the mast and topsail with its fanged maw. Fearful of what may happen if it should be allowed to direct its power upon your countrymen below, you decide that you must confront and slay this creature.</p>
       <p>You approach the giant spider from below and, at first, it fails to notice your presence. But when you pause for a few moments to unsheathe your weapon, it dips its head and you find yourself staring into a pair of ghastly green eyes. It rubs its forelegs together and sparks appear, warning you that it is preparing to launch a bolt of energy. Quickly you cut free a trailing rope and swing away from the mainmast just in time to avoid being burnt to a cinder when it launches its burst of crackling blue fire. Your swift action saves you, but as the momentum of your swing carries you back towards the mast, so you see that the creature is preparing a new form of attack.</p>
       <p>It waits until you come to rest in the rigging, and then it ejects a stream of grey fluid from a sac located below its gaping maw. This fluid hardens as it passes through the air, transforming into several long and sticky strands which threaten to engulf and imprison you in a soft, gluey web.</p>

The militia are examining their doors and windows for signs of a forced entry but all of them look secure. Then your eye is drawn to a grand temple on the far side of the plaza. Its great stone door is closed, but a smaller wooden door at the side has been torn off its hinges. You magnify your vision and see that beyond the door is a flight of stone steps which ascend to a bell-tower.</p>
       <p>Cautiously you approach the shattered door. You unsheathe your weapon and scan the darkened stairs before silently you move up the steps. You have climbed twenty steps when suddenly you hear a hideous snickering growl and an icy chill runs the length of your spine. There is an ominous creak of stone on stone and a movement in the darkness above, and then a crashing fills your ears. Out of the darkness you see a great marble statue come smashing down the narrow stairway. It rapidly gathers speed as it tumbles end-over-end towards you.</p>

       <p>You are shocked to see the attacking ship has a large cannon mounted on its prow. Moments after the pirates fire their gun, you hear the whistle of a heavy cannonball as it hurtles towards the deck of <cite>The Pride of Sommerlund</cite>. It rips through the gunwale a few feet from where you are standing and, as you dive to avoid it, you are hit in the legs by splinters of wood (lose 1 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> point).</p>
       <p>Fortunately, the rest of the crew escape injury and damage to the ship is minimal. Sergeant Dryan commands his men to return fire and a volley of shots from the three swivel guns slams into the bow of the pirate ship with devastating effect. Two shots penetrate below the waterline and the third severs the bowsprit. As it falls into the ocean, it rips away sail and rigging which drag more than a dozen pirates overboard. In disarray, the enemy vessel veers from its collision course and founders in the wake of <cite>The Pride of Sommerlund</cite> as it enters the Bukimi Channel. Here your ship picks up a prevailing wind which propels it away from the second pirate raider. Soon both ships have disappeared and, when Raker is sure that the danger has passed, he warmly praises both the marines and his crew for the skill and courage they have displayed.</p>
       <p>Later, as the ship navigates the narrow strait dividing the two Lakuri islands, you pass within a few hundred yards of the fire-blackened ruins of a beach settlement which nestles in a bay, overshadowed on three sides by cliffs. This is Kita Cove, formerly a secret base from where Captain Khadro launched his pirate fleet. As you stare at the charred remnants of the pirate settlement, you try to imagine what it must have looked like before the encampment was consumed by a tremendous fireball that sealed its doom. Suddenly, your daydreaming is interrupted when you see something moving among the ruins.</p>

       <p>Upon hearing the news that you have slain the Deathstalker, the mayor of Hikas summons you to his Grand Hall in the city<ch.apos/>s north quarter. Proudly the Vakeros lieutenant and his militia escort you across the city and during your march you receive the adulation of the grateful populace. The mayor hails you as the saviour of Hikas and he bestows upon you the freedom of the city. He decrees that the plaza, where the remains of the Deathstalker were destroyed, shall from this day forward be named after you in perpetual honour of your brave and gallant deed.</p>
       <p>You are invited to stay at the Grand Hall and feast with the mayor and the other dignitaries of the city.

Early the next morning, the Mayor presents you with a fine white stallion to help speed your journey to Elzian. You thank him for his generosity and, shortly before noon, you ride out through the gates of the Grand Hall, go south along the Avenue of the Sun, and cross the Bridge of Lanterns which spans the city<ch.apos/>s river. Citizens cheer as you pass through the southern quarter and they alert the guards at the busy south gatehouse so that by the time you arrive there you are able to ride through without delay.</p>
       <p>A mile beyond the south gate, the road ascends to a ridge where you stop to look back at Hikas for the last time. It is a warm and windy morning and, as you cast your gaze across the rooftops and towers of the ancient city, the sultry breeze howls like a wild animal. For a few moments you feel a chill in your blood, for the sound reminds you of the Deathstalker<ch.apos/>s ghastly cry. But then you shake your head and dismiss it. The creature is dead and there are still many miles left for you to travel before your quest is done. You salute the city farewell and set off at a brisk pace along the weatherbeaten road that leads to Gologo.</p>

       <p>A large wooden platform has been erected at the centre of the marketplace upon which twenty men and women are standing side by side with their heads bowed. These poor wretches wear heavy iron manacles which encase their wrists and ankles. Standing behind them are eight hard-faced guards, each with a loop of knotted rope that dangles menacingly from their wrists. The scorching desert sun beats down without mercy upon those in the line, yet if any of them should dare to move but an inch they immediately feel the stinging lash of a rope across their backs.</p>
       <p>Over the years you have heard many tales about the slave auctions of Vassagonia, but you had never anticipated that one day you would witness one. This cruel auction fills you with feelings of anger and revulsion as, one by one, the slaves are dragged from the line and sold to the highest bidder. The owner of the slaves is a stout Vassagonian with small piggy eyes and a wart which sits like a ripe brown cherry on the end of his nose. Every time a slave is sold he cackles like a witch when the new owner steps forward to pay the auction price.</p>
       <p>You are about to suggest to Oriah that you should leave the square and go back to the horses, when suddenly your Kai senses alert you to danger. Within the crowd there are many pairs of eyes that have been staring avariciously at your beautiful companion. The slave trader has become aware of this and you see him signal to his henchmen. Immediately they enter the crowd and move to encircle you and Oriah. You unsheathe your weapon and command the slaver to call off his men, but he ignores your order. Suddenly the crowd melts away to reveal his six muscular thugs. They are no longer holding knotted ropes; now they hold scimitars and axes with which they slash the air as they advance slowly towards you.</p>
       <p><quote>Slay him!</quote> shouts the slaver. <quote>Slay the Northlander and bring me the girl!</quote> You must fight them.</p>

       <p>Captain Raker permits his men to spend an hour or two fishing for Trarta. They are a delicacy, and they will serve to supplement the crew<ch.apos/>s basic provisions of salted meat and biscuits.

And then this supernatural horror surrenders to death and is brought crashing to the floor. For a few moments its great body convulses and then lies still. Wisps of evil-smelling gas arise from beneath the fur and you are forced to snatch your cloak to your face to deaden the sickly sweet stench of decay. You turn and hurry down the stairs in time to see the lieutenant and his militia breaking through the rubble which blocks the exit from the bell-tower. His men ascend the stairs and remove the vile, rotting remains of the Deathstalker which are placed upon a pyre outside in the tree-lined plaza. Soon the carcass of this murderous creature is ablaze and word of its death spreads swiftly across the city. The curfew is lifted and a large crowd comes and gathers around the dying embers of the pyre to cheer and rejoice in the destruction of the creature which, for the past month, has murdered their kinfolk and terrorized their peaceful city.</p>

       <p>Dromodon strides into the arena with his arms flung wide to receive the frenzied adulation of the crowd. He is a magnificent lion of a man, with broad shoulders and a mighty chest that ripples with bronzed muscle. His grim face is stern and majestic beneath a mane of wild black hair, and he moves with the confidence and grace of a huge, predatory animal. At first he appears to be the very embodiment of gladiatorial perfection, and you regret that you should have to fight this heroic warrior to the death. But your regrets soon evaporate when you look into his eyes, for you see revealed there his true nature. Beneath the fa<ch.ccedil/>ade of his heroic exterior lurks a soul filled with evil. Your senses tell you that he is a secret worshipper of Naar. The Dark God has given him many rewards<ch.emdash/>his strength and his status<ch.emdash/>and in return Dromodon has consigned hundreds of noble souls to an eternity of slavery in the thrall of Naar. Now you see him for what he really is<ch.emdash/>a ruthless murderer, a heartless killing machine<ch.emdash/>and all empathy with him as a fellow warrior is lost. This will be a fight to the death and you must fight to win!</p>

       <p>For an hour you ride without daring to stop in case the slaver has dispatched his henchmen to pursue you. The hills keep the interior of this country hidden from view until you reach a broad-based canyon bisected by a meandering stream. The threat of pursuit has now passed and so you halt here to slake your thirst before continuing your long ride south.</p>
       <p>Beyond the canyon, the road crosses a rolling coastal plain which lies at the eastern edge of the Dry Main<ch.emdash/>Vassagonia<ch.apos/>s vast desert. The undulations of its windswept sands give this great sun-bleached emptiness the appearance of a vast yellow sea that seems to stretch away into infinity. You feel a disturbing unease as you stare across this wilderness for there is nothing to break the view, and nothing that could offer you a place to hide should the need arise.</p>
       <p>As dusk approaches you are pleased to see that the road bears to the east and passes within sight of the ocean. The heat of the day has now surrendered to a biting night wind that makes your horse and your companions shiver. Mindful of their need for shelter, you leave the road and scout the rugged coastline in search of a cave in which to spend the night. Your tracking skills lead you to a dry cave that is ideal and you camp here and build a fire from driftwood. Over a meal of roasted crabmeat the conversation turns to Oriah and your fears for her safety. Later this night, as you sit the first watch, you offer a prayer to the Goddess Ishir to protect her and keep her safe. You have a strong feeling that the young woman is still alive and that one day, sometime in the future, your paths are destined to cross once more.</p>
       <p>After a few hours, Sligh wakes from his slumber to take his turn keeping watch at the mouth of the cave. Gladly you hand over the duty to him and settle down for some much needed sleep (you may restore 3 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points).</p>

Yranai looks up to see shreds of cloth trailing from the punctured canopy above and the sight proves too much for him: he faints. Hurriedly you haul his frail body over your shoulder.

       <p>You nod to affirm this and the excited little man proceeds to tell you about himself and his business. You hear that he is a merchant who was born in Casiorn but who now lives in the city of Kuchek. When he was a young man he traded silk for wheat in Holmgard where he first encountered the Kai. Once, when his caravan was attacked by a Giak war party on the Ruanon Pike, it was the timely intervention of a Kai journeyman that saved his life and his cargo. Since that day he has revered your warrior order. Barely pausing for breath, he tells you proudly that he has a ship moored in the harbour which is filled with timber that he intends to trade for spices in Bisutan. He plans to set sail tomorrow at noon. When at last he pauses to take a sip of ale from his tankard, you inform him that you and your three companions are travelling overland to Elzian.</p>
       <p><quote>By horse? Such a tiring way to travel and such a difficult road too,</quote> he says. <quote>I would gladly offer you passage aboard my ship but, alas, I carry such a heavy cargo that I could only accommodate one extra passenger. You would be most welcome to sail with me to Bisutan, but sadly I am unable to offer such a favour to your friends.</quote></p>
       <p>You thank Kol for his offer but decline it, preferring to stay with the marines. You are tired now, and so you rise from your seat and bid the friendly trader goodnight and a safe voyage. As you turn to go to your room he calls out: <quote>If you should change your mind, remember I sail at noon. My ship is moored at the end of the east quay.

       <p>By the skill of her crew and helmsman, <cite>The Pride of Sommerlund</cite> enters the Bukimi Channel and picks up a prevailing wind which propels her swiftly away from the pirate raiders. Soon the enemy ships have disappeared beyond the distant horizon. When Raker is sure that they have abandoned the chase, he praises his First Mate and crew and promises that tonight they can look forward to a double rum ration as reward for their skilful seamanship.</p>
       <p>As the ship navigates the narrow strait dividing these two Lakuri islands, you pass close by the fire-blackened ruins of a beach settlement which nestles in a bay overshadowed by cliffs. It is Kita Cove, formerly the secret base from where Captain Khadro launched his pirate fleet. Staring at the charred remnants of his settlement, you try to imagine what it must have looked like before the encampment was consumed by the tremendous fireball that was to seal its doom.</p>
       <p>A mile beyond Kita Cove, the strait becomes narrower at a place where it passes between two overhanging cliffs. Paoll is sure that he can navigate safely through this channel, but his confidence is shaken when the lookout suddenly screams a warning: <quote>Whirlpool ahead!</quote></p>
       <p>When you catch sight of the swirling, foaming water, you sense immediately that this is not a natural phenomenon: this watery vortex is the result of evil sorcery.</p>

       <p>You ride the benign thermal currents that swirl between these lower mountain peaks and enjoy a spectacular aerial view of the Great Masourn Range. Within the hour you emerge from the peaks and drift towards columns of rock that rise up from the lower slopes of the timbered mountainside. Circling above one of these columns are six large, black winged birds. You magnify your vision and your pulse quickens when instantly you recognize them to be Itikars<ch.emdash/>giant Vassagonian eagles.</p>
       <p>The leader of this predatory group has golden markings on his wing tips that glint in the sun, giving them a metallic appearance, and when he sees the balloon approaching he veers away from the column. The others follow his lead and all six come flying towards you in a wedge-shaped formation.</p>
       <p>They fly past overhead and stare down at the balloon with their cold black eyes. Then the leader turns about and you sense that he intends to attack you on his next pass. His companions form up behind him in a line and he leads them in a steep dive.</p>

       <p>You look to the bell and use your Kai Mastery in an attempt to locate the creature, but you can sense nothing unusual. Then a knot of fear tightens in your throat when suddenly you detect a powerful aura of evil. You turn to look at the cowering cleric and your fear becomes an icy terror when you realize that <em>he</em> is the source of the evil. Slowly you move backwards towards the stairs and he pleads with you not to go. Then he abandons his pretence. The pupils of his eyes shimmer and become spheres that glow darkly amber, and in a terrifying instant his body transforms. One moment he is a bearded holy man and, in a split-second blur, he becomes a snarling hulk of black-furred death. With breathtaking speed it leaps at you and slashes at your throat with its razor-sharp talons.</p>

       <p>You bid Kol good luck and wish him a safe voyage before you and your companions collect your horses and set off from the tavern. The streets of Bir Rabalou are quiet this morning and you reach the city<ch.apos/>s south gate without incident.

They shout and curse you and loose off a few arrows in your wake, but these are poorly aimed and you escape from the city unharmed.</p>
       <p>It is approaching noon when you arrive at a junction where the coast road splits in two. Ahead of you are the gentle foothills of the Koneshi Mountains, and beyond them you glimpse the snowy peaks of that great range rising majestically into the cloudless sky. Away to the east you can see the rugged coastline of southern Vassagonia where the cresting ocean waves break their backs upon wild and rocky beaches.</p>
       <p>A signpost at the junction points to the east and to the south. To the east it reads, <quote>Khor<ch.emdash/>100 miles / Bisutan<ch.emdash/>225 miles</quote>. To the south it reads, <quote>Koneshi Pass to Bisutan<ch.emdash/>125 miles</quote>.</p>

       <p>The innkeeper vouches to the nervous lieutenant that you are a journeyman and not the creature that has paralysed Hikas with a reign of terror. The lieutenant relaxes a little and sheathes his sword. He shouts to a unit of his guardsmen who are grouped outside to form into a column and get ready to march, and then he turns to you and asks you to accompany him.</p>

       <p>The enemy ship is less than a hundred yards off the port beam when you see the dark shape at its prow begin to twitch and shudder. At first it resembles the body of some grotesque gigantic tick; then eight rubbery legs spring from its black underbelly and suddenly the shape takes on a far more sinister aspect.</p>
       <p>A gasp of terror arises from the crew when this spider-like monstrosity opens its scarlet maw and emits a high-pitched chittering shriek. As the enemy vessel speeds nearer you watch with mounting dread as this hideous spider-creature raises its forelegs, as if in readiness to pounce. Furiously it rubs its forelimbs together and a mass of blue-white sparks appear at their tips. Then suddenly there is a deafening crackle of electrical power. A bolt of blazing energy shoots from the creature<ch.apos/>s maw and snakes across the water towards the crew and marines aboard your ship. The creature<ch.apos/>s attack hits its mark and the effect is swift and devastating. The crackling bolt ignites timber and sail, and leaves a dozen men sprawled dead or unconscious across the decks. Through the smoke of the burning sailcloth you see the enemy vessel bearing down to ram <cite>The Pride of Sommerlund</cite>. Impact is but seconds away.</p>

       <p>The sun grows warmer as noon approaches and the parched hills around Bavari melt away into a lush savannah of tall grasses, broken occasionally by swathes of loamy soil. The air has become humid and the fertile landscape is rich with fauna. In the distance, the verdant foothills of the Great Masourn Mountains appear in stark contrast to the brown arid wastes through which you have travelled these past few days.</p>
       <p>As night falls you find yourself approaching a village which sits astride the border with neighbouring Dessi. It shelters behind a tall palisade which is patrolled by several Vakeros, the indigenous tribesmen of this realm. They are an ancient race whose lineage can be traced back to the Age of the Old Kingdoms, yet the Vassagonians consider them to be primitives and often pour scorn on their simple ways and their tribal culture. Some of Vassagonia<ch.apos/>s more ruthless leaders have in the past waged war upon the Vakeros with the aim of stealing their fertile land, but all of these wars have ended in costly defeat for Vassagonia. Dessi is ruled by the Elder Magi whose mastery of Old Kingdom magic is unparalleled and, over many centuries, they have taught the secrets of their battle-sorcery to the Vakeros. Armed with magic, they have kept their land and their culture secure from the ravages of their aggressive desert neighbour.</p>
       <p>Since the demise of the Darklords and the fall of Zakhan Kimah<ch.emdash/>the despised Vassagonian ruler<ch.emdash/>peace has returned to the border regions of Dessi. Yet, as you approach the palisade, you see that the Vakeros guards are wary and suspicious. One of their elders approaches you and, with a staff of twisted black wood, he signals that he wants you to halt. Your Sixth Sense detects that his staff possesses magical properties; he is using it to assess if you are a threat to his village.</p>

       <p>A dozen arena guards rush into the room and elbow their way through the gladiators<ch.apos/> advancing ranks. They are armed with Bor muskets which they level at your head and chest. These primitive firearms are wildly inaccurate at ranges where a bow can be precise and deadly, but they are devastating when used at close quarters. Reluctantly you sheathe your weapon and raise your hands in surrender for to attempt an escape now is futile.</p>
       <p>The gladiators surround you swiftly and drag you out of the room. You are manhandled roughly along the tunnel and brought before a distinguished-looking man who is clad in fine white linen and jewel-encrusted armour. He is Torvax, the owner of the dead warrior-slave Malduz. The news that his finest gladiator is dead sends him into a blind fury. Malduz was to fight at dusk in the final combat of the circus. Now Torvax stands to lose the winner<ch.apos/>s purse of 1,000 Gold Crowns. In his rage he orders that you be executed at dusk before the entire arena. The situation is looking hopeless until, as you are being dragged away, you offer to fight for Torvax in Malduz<ch.apos/>s place.</p>

You sense that each man, in his own way, is grieving the loss of this brave young sergeant. Soon their jovial conversation has become tinged with melancholy and homesickness and you become a little worried by their mood of sadness. To raise their morale you ask the owner to bring them each a measure of his finest brew. Gladly he accepts your order and pours each man a flagon of strong dark ale.

       <p>Your single-handed victory forces the surviving raiders to retreat towards the port beam. But before you can reach Sergeant Dryan and his men, these raiders receive reinforcements from their ship and they begin to advance towards you once more.</p>
       <p>Suddenly a falling chunk of wood smashes into the deck close to where you are standing. When you look up, you see that the giant spider is now tearing at the mast and topsail with its fanged maw. Fearful of what may happen if it should be allowed to direct its power upon the decks below, you decide that you must confront the creature and defeat it as swiftly as you are able. Using your natural Kai speed and agility, you scale the mainmast and approach the giant spider from below. At first it fails to notice you, but when you pause for a few moments to unsheathe your weapon, it dips its head and you find yourself staring into a pair of ghastly green eyes. It rubs its forelegs together and sparks appear, warning you that it is preparing to launch a bolt of energy. Quickly you cut free a trailing rope and swing away from the mainmast just in time to avoid being burnt to a cinder when it launches its burst of crackling blue fire. Your swift action saves you, but as the momentum of your swing carries you back towards the mast, so you see that the creature is preparing a new form of attack.</p>
       <p>It waits until you come to rest in the rigging, and then it ejects a stream of grey fluid from a sac located below its gaping maw. This fluid hardens as it passes through the air, transforming into several long and sticky strands which threaten to engulf and imprison you in a gluey web.</p>

       <p>Unfortunately, when you cast <spell>Levitation</spell> in mid-air, you did not anticipate that the increased weight of Yranai would have any effect on your control of this spell. It is not until you are within twenty feet of the ground that you realize you are coming down too fast. You attempt to compensate but it is too late and you strike the rocky soil with a tremendous jolt that knocks you unconscious.</p>

       <p>Together with Paoll and a party of five armed marines, you row ashore in the ship<ch.apos/>s longboat. With weapons drawn, you and your search party sift through the ruins of Khadro<ch.apos/>s encampment but find few items of any practical value. There are several tracks which have been made by the creatures you glimpsed earlier, but they all lead away into the surrounding jungle and you can no longer detect their presence.</p>
       <p>Mindful of the risk you are taking simply by being here on the island, away from the ship, you signal to the men to return to the longboat. As you are descending the beach, you trip accidentally upon something half-buried in the black sand. Closer inspection reveals it to be a fist-sized ball of iron that has been crafted into the shape of a human skull. (If you wish to keep this Iron Skull, record it on your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a> as a Special Item which you carry in the pocket of your tunic.)</p>

       <p>Shocked by this mental intrusion, you dig your heels into Jhani<ch.apos/>s flanks and urge the old mare to the gallop. The elder dodges aside as your horse bolts forward and the Vakeros guards along the palisade loose off their arrows. They whistle past you on all sides yet, in the near-darkness, fail to find their mark. Keeping yourself pressed low against your horse<ch.apos/>s neck, you steer her around the perimeter of the palisade and into a field of tall bamboo where you quickly disappear from sight.</p>
       <p>It is dark when you finally rein Jhani to a halt. You dismount and tend to the hundreds of tiny cuts and abrasions she has sustained to her legs, caused by the sharp bamboo stalks. Rather than push on in the dark and have your horse sustain more injuries, you camp here for the night. Unfortunately, the bamboo fields of Dessi are notorious for their infestations of biting mosquitoes, and you spend most of the long night fending them off: lose 3 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points. Also, unless you possess the Discipline of Grand Huntmastery, you must now eat a Meal or lose a further 3 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points.</p>
       <p>In the early morning light you are able to lead your horse out of the bamboo field and find your way back onto the road to Hikas.</p>

       <p>It is noon of the following day when eventually you emerge from the Koneshi Mountains and catch your first exciting glimpse of the great city of Bisutan, seated upon an island in the estuary of the River Khorda. With an air of expectation you follow the mountain road as it meanders down through sagebrush hills until, at dusk, you finally reach a titanic stone bridge that spans the shimmering waters of the Khorda. This mighty bridge has for centuries carried a flow of traders to and from a towering gatehouse which is set into the city<ch.apos/>s protective wall.</p>
       <p>It is not the custom of Bisutan<ch.apos/>s city guards to stop travellers without good reason, for here the merchants of all Magnamund meet to haggle and trade and barter their cargoes. With a courteous smile they allow you to pass through their great gate and enter their magnificent city.</p>

       <p>You enter the right alley and the militia, who are following closely, split into two groups. Roughly half their number searches the other alley whilst the remainder stays with you.</p>
       <p>As you are running along this narrow thoroughfare, you suddenly hear the sound of splintering timbers somewhere in the distance. A hundred yards later the alley opens out into a tree-lined plaza which is bordered by shops selling rare artefacts of the Old Kingdom, and expensive works of art. Their windows and doors are securely barred and shuttered and show no signs of a forced entry. Then your eye is drawn to a grand building on the far side of the plaza: it is a temple. Its great stone door is closed, but a smaller wooden door at the side has been torn off its hinges. You magnify your vision and see that beyond the door is a flight of stone steps which ascend to a bell-tower.</p>
       <p>Cautiously you approach the shattered door. You unsheathe your weapon and scan the darkened stairs before silently you ascend the steps. You have climbed twenty steps when suddenly you hear a hideous snickering growl and an icy chill runs the length of your spine. There is an ominous creak of stone on stone and a movement in the darkness above, and then a crashing fills your ears. Out of the darkness you see a great marble statue come smashing down the narrow stairway. It rapidly gathers speed as it tumbles end-over-end towards you.</p>

You attribute these feelings to the sight of Gorgoron. You have heard many dark tales about this chasm which, until now, you had dismissed as nothing more than fanciful ghost stories. Having seen the chasm with your own eyes you are no longer so ready to disbelieve them.</p>
       <p>At sundown you reach the palmy fringes of an ancient settlement that surrendered to the jungle centuries ago. The moon rises like a silver shield in the cloudless night sky and you make camp at the side of the trail, sheltered beneath a canopy of mosses and vines. The jungle is alive with the tiny noises of its nocturnal creatures. They seem to make your horse unusually nervous, until you soothe him with your Magnakai skills of Animal Control. You are tired after your long ride through this humid rainforest and soon you drift off to sleep. It seems as if you have only just closed your eyes when you are stirred to instant wakefulness by the sound of a ghastly howl.</p>

It rubs its forelegs together and sparks appear, warning you that it is preparing to launch a bolt of energy.

Your swift action saves you, but as the momentum of your swing carries you back towards the rigging, you see that the creature is preparing a new form of attack.</p>
       <p>It waits until you come to rest upon the criss-cross of ropes and then it ejects a stream of grey fluid from a sac located below its gaping maw. This fluid hardens as it passes through the air, and it transforms into several long and sticky strands which threaten to engulf you.</p>

Its ancient streets are cobbled with lime green stone, and ornate structures of vivid Vakeros art embellish every building and street corner. There is a festival taking place here tonight and the town is in a lively carnival mood. As you ride down a steep, narrow street towards the beach, you can see a crowd of native Vakeros are gathered there in brightly coloured costumes. Some wear elaborate headgear made from lacquered wood and feathers, and others are covered from neck to ankle with garments made from vibrant jungle blooms. There is a full moon tonight and the people of this town are celebrating the fertility of their land with ritual offerings of food and wine to the Goddess Ishir. It is a joyous festival and everyone on the beach is smiling and happy.</p>

       <p>You stare across the ocean at the banks of angry clouds which are growing larger and darker with every passing minute. You sense that within them are tremendous natural forces that are building up at a dangerous rate. You feel certain that the presence of the Moonstone is partially responsible for this, although these waters are notorious for their sudden and violent sea-storms.</p>
       <p>Gradually the temperature drops and the gentle undulation of the waves grows fiercer. The wind becomes a gale and the azure sky grows darker and darker, until the sun is lost from view and the ship is shrouded by a deep grey twilight. Soon lightning is the only source of illumination. It tears the roiling clouds and transforms the sea into an angry beast that lashes and batters the ship with a supernatural fury. Then the darkness is obliterated by a great curtain of white fire. Tongues of flame lance down, boiling the sea where they strike the surface and sending up great clouds of steam in their wake. Miraculously these terrifying bolts of power miss the ship, but soon they are rivalled in their ferocity by another terrifying force that is battling to free itself from this hellish storm.</p>
       <p>A hundred balls of dancing fire fall from the clouds like a shower of blazing meteors. One such meteor strikes the helmsman who is struggling with the ship<ch.apos/>s wheel, and it engulfs him. For a few dreadful moments his head and chest are contained within a roaring yellow orb; then the burning ball is caught by the wind and it spins away into the darkness. The crew scream with terror when they look upon their comrade, for his upper body has been transformed into a blackened and fleshless skull that perches precariously upon a hollow, smoking rib cage.</p>

       <p>Panic grips the Vassagonian sailors. They abandon their posts and rush to seek shelter below decks in the crowded cargo hold. You are trying to rally them when suddenly a ball of flame drops from the raging skies and comes hurtling down towards your head.</p>

Kol appears, shaking and dishevelled, yet he finds the words to express how he and his men feel. He praises your skill and bravery and says that everyone aboard owes you their lives. As a small token of his gratitude he offers you his Sword, his Dagger, and a pouch containing 20 Gold Crowns.

       <p>You recite the words of the Brotherhood Spell <spell>Lightning Hand</spell> and cast a bolt of energy at the leader. It strikes the bird<ch.apos/>s wing and breaks the bone, causing the creature to spiral out of control. Yranai cheers but his triumphant cry is premature. You watch aghast as the Itikar collides with the balloon and stabs its talons into the canopy. In its desperation to survive, it shreds the cloth to ribbons before it falls away and plummets to its doom in the timberlands below.</p>
       <p>The impact of the bird hitting the canopy knocks you off your feet. Yranai falls on top of you and, for a few nerve-racking seconds, you lie entangled at the bottom of the basket.

When you pull yourself up and peer over the rim of the basket you see the trees of the lower mountain slopes rising towards you at a dizzying speed. Yranai looks up to see shreds of cloth trailing from the punctured canopy above and the sight is too much for him: he faints. Hurriedly you haul his frail body over your shoulder. Then you place one foot on the rim of the basket and get ready to make a desperate leap away from this doomed balloon as the tops of the mountain pines come into view.</p>
       <p>With the old magician draped over your shoulder, you leap from the basket and plummet towards the ground.

       <p>Unfortunately, when you cast <spell>Levitation</spell> in mid-air, you did not anticipate that the increased weight of Yranai would have any effect on your control of the spell.

You attempt to compensate but it is too late and you strike the rocky soil with a tremendous jolt that knocks you unconscious.</p>

Here the marines go looking for some <foreign xml:lang="x-vassagonian">mhaktis</foreign><ch.emdash/>the flowing grey and white robes traditionally worn by the desert dwellers of Vassagonia. While they busy themselves in the hunt for new clothes, you water and feed the horses at the village stables. You are tending to the horses when you are approached by an elderly street vendor. He is pushing a handcart on which he has displayed the following items for sale:</p>

Shortly before noon you happen upon the town of Kilij which lies in a narrow pass between two steep hillsides. Oriah and the marines are tired and sore after the long night<ch.apos/>s ride and they urge you to stop here so that they might eat and rest awhile. Together you ride into the town<ch.apos/>s busy market square and dismount at a stone water trough where you allow your horses to drink their fill. Around you the mood of the townspeople is friendly as they barter and trade their wares. A young boy offers to look after your horses while you visit the market.

       <p>Fernant<ch.apos/>s servant returns to the room with a beautiful young woman by his side. She is dressed in the simple brown robes of a peasant girl, yet her long black tresses and smooth olive complexion indicate that she is of high-born ancestry. For a moment she holds you with her deep brown eyes and you sense at once that she is as intelligent as she is beautiful.</p>
       <p><quote>This is Oriah,</quote> says Fernant, rising from his seat. <quote>Welcome, my dear. You are among friends here.</quote> The young woman offers him her elegant hand and he kisses it lightly before turning to face you. <quote>I have promised her safe passage to Bisutan aboard <cite>The Pride of Sommerlund</cite>. I trust you do not object?</quote> he says.</p>

       <p>At first you are wary of permitting a stranger to join the ship. She is a very attractive young woman, and her company would certainly be appreciated during the long voyage south, but the agents of Naar have been known to adopt many guises to further their evil aims. Fernant, sensing your reticence, attempts to persuade you by explaining the predicament in which Oriah has been placed through no fault of her own.</p>
       <p>You learn that Oriah is the daughter of Khazullo<ch.emdash/>the Funtal of Fio Fadali<ch.emdash/>a rich, powerful, and very ruthless man. He has pledged his daughter<ch.apos/>s hand in marriage to Sesketera, the ruler of the city-state of Ghol-Tabras in northern Shadaki. Sesketera is a cruel and brutal suitor, and Oriah will be sure to spend the rest of her life as little more than his slave if the marriage takes place as her father has planned. Her father is deaf to her wishes; his only concern is for the political union of the two cities. His daughter<ch.apos/>s happiness means nothing to him when compared to the riches and power he will gain from a marriage to the House of Sesketera.</p>
       <p>Oriah has run away from her father<ch.apos/>s palace in Fio Fadali and she has sought refuge in Barrakeesh. But agents in the employ of her father and Sesketera have traced her to the capital and now she must flee once more. Fernant, moved by the plight of this brave young woman, has pledged to help her reach Bisutan where trusted friends will smuggle her to safety in neighbouring Kakush.</p>
       <p>Having heard her story and satisfied yourself that she poses no threat to your mission, you agree to allow her to travel with you to Bisutan aboard <cite>The Pride of Sommerlund</cite>. Oriah and Fernant thank you for your compassion, and the Lord-lieutenant suggests that perhaps it is time to retire for the night. He has his servant take Oriah to an adjoining chamber, and he offers you the use of a room upstairs. It is a very warm and humid night and you decide that perhaps it would be more comfortable if you were to sleep outside on the roof. Fernant has his servant bring you a mattress upon which you settle down to sleep under the desert stars.</p>

       <p>The road becomes increasingly tortuous as it traverses the central reaches of the Koneshi Mountains. Long winding climbs around precipitous cliffs are followed by steep descents into wooded ravines which test your nerve and your horsemanship to the full. Among the trunks of the blond Vassagonian mountain pines which border this route you glimpse the feral eyes of hungry timber wolves. Their howling disturbs the horses and you are forced to use your Kai skills throughout this difficult crossing to keep all four of the steeds calm and controllable.</p>
       <p>It is a little after midday when you hear the rumble of thunder echoing through the surrounding peaks. You suspect a storm must be approaching, yet the sky above is clear and your keen senses detect no winds nor any change in atmospheric pressures. Later, as the trail passes around a steep cliff-face, you see the cause of the rumbling: ahead the narrow trail is blocked by a landslide. The dust has settled and, when you magnify your vision, you think you can see a way to cross the mound of broken rocks. You tell the marines to wait for you while you go ahead to check if it is safe for you all to proceed. You are picking your way cautiously across the rockfall when suddenly a loud roar fills your ears and you look up to see a thousand tons of loose shale come tumbling down the mountainside. It is too narrow to turn your horse about and so you dig your heels into his flanks and urge him forwards. To your horror, he panics and rears up on his hind legs in an attempt to throw you off his back.</p>

       <p>Beyond its encircling wall the deserted streets of Khor lend it the aspect of a ghost town. You magnify your vision and you are able to count more than a hundred freshly-dug graves within fifty paces of the town gates. The gates themselves hang open and unguarded, and when you pass through them, the hooves of your horses make a hollow echo along the empty streets beyond. You hear a distant bell tolling and you follow the sound to a mount which overlooks the town harbour. Here you see some of the inhabitants for the first time and you are shocked by how pale and gaunt they all appear.</p>
       <p>A funeral is in progress and the bereaved are walking in line behind a hearse which bears a casket draped with black silk. The procession halts when it reaches the top of the mount and then the casket is quickly interred and sealed inside a marble tomb. A dignified-looking man addresses the mourners. He praises the qualities of the man they have laid to rest and then, in his official capacity as the Mayor of Khor, he declares that a state of quarantine will exist in the town from midnight onwards.</p>

       <p>You try to recall what you know about the sickness called Bita Fever. During your studies of the Kai curing skills you were told about this tropical disease, but all you can recall is that it originated in the Bita Swamp of Dessi and that it is usually only fatal in the very young or the old. Healthy adults rarely die from it, although the symptoms in those affected are unsightly. Victims suffer a scarlet rash that often affects the face and hands. A normally healthy person who contracts the disease will usually recover completely within a month.</p>
       <p>When you look at the faces of the mourners you notice that many of them are red and swollen. The marines have never before encountered this disease, and when you tell them what you know, they insist on leaving at once, before the quarantine is put into force.</p>

       <p>You wake early and take time to clean your Weapons and equipment before going downstairs to the taproom at dawn to meet with Yranai. Together you leave the tavern and pass through the town<ch.apos/>s east gate as a bell in a nearby tower clangs five times. For a mile you walk along the caravan route to Hikas until you come to a place where a fallen toa tree lies across a ditch beside the road. Yranai stops here and points to a gentle hill little more than half a mile distant. <quote>I<ch.apos/>m sure she<ch.apos/>s behind that hummock,</quote> he muses, and he sets off with you following patiently behind.</p>
       <p>As you reach the top of the hill you see his flying craft resting in a gully below. It is a huge balloon which is attached by steel cables to a basket that lies on its side. A tangle of metal pipes and brass cylinders hangs suspended in a cradle under the balloon, and several parts of this strange engine are dented and scraped, indicating that Yranai must have had a bumpy landing. On reaching the balloon, you struggle to set the basket upright while Yranai fits the repaired convexor. Minutes later, he turns a valve and the engine splutters into life. After a few bangs and wheezes it settles into a chugging rhythm, and you both scramble to climb aboard as the balloon rises and hoists the basket off the ground.</p>
       <p><cite>Simoom</cite> ascends rapidly into the cloudless sky. Soon you can see the town of Bavari spread out below you like a detailed map, the southern Vassagonian coastline with its inlets and villages, and to the south the snowy peaks of the Great Masourn Mountains. Yranai tinkers with the engine and you feel the balloon beginning to drift southwards, towards a gap in the peaks of the great mountain range.</p>

       <p>Young city children wave and cheer as the caravan trundles out of Bisutan. Soon you cross the great southern bridge, and when you look down at the sparkling blue waters of the Khorda, you see there a flotilla of tiny fishing craft plying their trade. For the first hour of the journey you content yourself with the view and watch the lush scenery and picturesque villages of the river basin pass before your eyes. However, when the caravan enters the Bavari Hills this pleasant landscape soon gives way to a more mundane vista<ch.emdash/>a seemingly endless sea of barren mounds and arid rocky outcrops.</p>
       <p>After a while your attention turns to the other passengers. They are a cheerful group of Vassagonians who are returning to their homes in Bavari after family visits and business in Bisutan. You pass the time exchanging stories and playing cards. You learn that this caravan is regularly used by the merchants of Bavari and Hikas. They prefer to transport their wares by road rather than risk the sea voyage through the Bay of Sharks. Contrary to its name, you hear that there are no longer any sharks in this bay; they migrated to southern waters many centuries ago. One of the passengers jokingly suggests that the reason they left was because of the pirates. The bay is a notorious haunt of buccaneer fleets and renegade privateers.</p>
       <p>The surrounding country may be bleak and barren to the eye, but the road is good and the territory is safe. The merchants have established armed outposts every 20 miles which help to deter bandits from raiding the caravans <foreign xml:lang="fr">en route</foreign>. The first night is spent at an outpost and the second night a camp is struck at an oasis where the road is joined by a track. This neglected track traverses the mountains and leads to the Great Masourn Trail, an ancient trade route. Many of your fellow travellers have been looking forward to arriving at the oasis, for it allows them the chance to visit Temujun the Sage<ch.emdash/>the famous soothsayer of the Dry Main, and when the caravan arrives there, they hurriedly disembark. You watch with fascination as half of your wagon<ch.apos/>s passengers scurry towards Temujun<ch.apos/>s tent, which is pitched at the edge of a shimmering pool, whilst the other half gather about a blazing campfire and share their food while they enjoy a performance given by a troupe of actors.</p>

Ernan leads your party through the warm, lantern-lit streets of this fragrant coastal town and soon you arrive at the Barczak Stables.

If the five of you were all to pool every Gold Crown you possess, you would still not have enough to buy even the cheapest horse on this list.</p>
       <p>In a paddock behind the main building you can see a dozen horses quietly enjoying the warm night air. Sligh points out that there is nobody around and he suggests that it would be easy for you to help yourselves to five of these fine steeds.</p>

       <p>The road from Hikas to Gologo is an ancient trail which crosses rich plantations of tropical crops that are cultivated by the Vakeros, and then meanders through wild expanses of jungle that have for centuries defied all attempts at cultivation. As you ride this lush road, you are reminded of your history lessons at the Kai Monastery and you recall some of the things you were taught about this ancient realm.</p>
       <p>Dessi is ruled by the Elder Magi who are all that remain of a race of great magicians who once ruled central Magnamund thousands of years ago. They were the first practitioners of magic upon this world, and they were wise and powerful leaders until their numbers were decimated by a Great Plague that was released by their enemies<ch.emdash/>the Cener Druids of Ruel. Those who survived sought refuge here in fertile Dessi and have lived here ever since.</p>

Here you dismount and wait until those who are chasing you have ridden past. When their torches can no longer be seen in the distance you remount and begin to retrace your tracks out of the gully. You are within a few dozen yards of the road when something startles your horse and he rears up on his hind legs, throwing you heavily to the ground (lose 2 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points).</p>
       <p>You are getting to your feet when you feel a sharp pain shoot up the back of your leg: you have been bitten by a snake. Oswin unsheathes his sword and leans from his horse to take a swipe at the ground. His blow severs the snake<ch.apos/>s head from its body and it falls close by. To your dismay you see that it is a Jubai<ch.emdash/>the most poisonous of Vassagonia<ch.apos/>s desert serpents. Your natural Kai curing skills act swiftly to counter the toxin that has entered your blood, but Jubai venom is very potent and you have received a massive dose.</p>

       <p>You are horrified to see that the attacking ship has a large cannon mounted on its prow. Moments after the pirates fire their gun, you hear the whistle of a heavy cannonball as it hurtles towards the deck of <cite>The Pride of Sommerlund</cite>. It rips through the gunwale close to where you are standing and you are knocked over by the blast (lose 3 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points). As you drag yourself to your feet, you discover that your Backpack has saved you from sustaining a more serious injury. (Two of the items that you are carrying have been destroyed by the blast. You must now erase two items of your choice from your Backpack Items list.)</p>
       <p>As the smoke clears you see that the rest of the crew have escaped injury, and damage to the ship is minimal. You hear Sergeant Dryan command his men to return fire and a volley of shots from the three swivel guns slams into the bow of the pirate ship with devastating effect. Two shots penetrate below the waterline and the third severs the bowsprit. As it falls into the ocean, it rips away sail and rigging which drag more than a dozen pirates overboard. In disarray, the enemy vessel veers from its collision course and founders in the wake of <cite>The Pride of Sommerlund</cite> as it enters the Bukimi Channel. Here your ship picks up a prevailing wind which propels it away from the second pirate raider. Soon both ships have disappeared and, when Raker is sure that the danger has passed, he warmly praises both the marines and his crew for the skill and courage they have displayed.</p>
       <p>Later, as the ship navigates the narrow strait dividing the two Lakuri islands, you pass within a few hundred yards of the fire-blackened ruins of a beach settlement which nestles in a bay, overshadowed on three sides by cliffs. This is Kita Cove, formerly a secret base from where Captain Khadro launched his pirate fleet. As you stare at the charred remnants of the pirate settlement, you try to imagine what it must have looked like before the encampment was consumed by a tremendous fireball that sealed its doom. Suddenly your daydreaming is interrupted when, to your shocked surprise, you see something moving among the ruins.</p>

       <p>Svolta screams as your killing blow pierces his chest. He drops his sword, staggers drunkenly backwards, and then falls off the edge of the slave platform to land in an undignified heap on the dusty ground. His master<ch.emdash/>the slaver<ch.emdash/>has disappeared into the crowd, but by using your Sixth Sense and tracking skills you discover that he has slipped away to hide in the adjoining bazaar.</p>
       <p>You leap from the platform and set off across the square towards the market bazaar. The slaver<ch.apos/>s henchmen, fearing that you may escape, immediately move in from all sides to block your path. The crowd scream and scatter as you approach them for they are terrified at the prospect of being dragged into a bloody m<ch.ecirc/>l<ch.eacute/>e when the slaver<ch.apos/>s thugs catch up with you. Then suddenly, in the midst of this chaotic tangle of running and screaming people, appear Ernan, Sligh, and Oswin mounted upon their steeds, and yours and Oriah<ch.apos/>s horses in tow. News of what has happened here at the slave market has spread like wildfire through the rest of Kilij. On hearing these reports, the marines have rushed here as quickly as they could.</p>
       <p><quote>Come, Grand Master!</quote> shouts Oswin, and he throws you the rope that is now attached to your steed<ch.apos/>s head. <quote>We must flee this town at once!</quote></p>
       <p>You leap onto the blanket-saddle which is tied to your horse<ch.apos/>s back, take hold of the rope reins in both hands, and dig your heels into his flanks to urge him to the gallop. Two of the slaver<ch.apos/>s henchmen rush to block your escape but they are trampled into the dirt when your horse bolts away. You race towards a tree-lined avenue on the south side of the square with your three companions galloping close behind. As you enter this thoroughfare, you see one of the slaver<ch.apos/>s men come rushing out of a doorway. He is armed with a bow, and as you gallop past him, he draws an arrow to his lips and takes careful aim at your head.</p>

Exhausted after your ordeal at the gladiatorial arena, you unshoulder your Backpack and collapse on the bed without bothering to undress. Yet, despite your fatigue, you cannot seem to fall asleep. For more than an hour you lie staring at the cobwebbed beams of the ceiling as, in your mind<ch.apos/>s eye, you recall some of the dramatic events of your journey so far. You picture Oriah being carried away by the Itikar, the deaths of Fernant and Sergeant Dryan aboard <cite>The Pride of Sommerlund</cite>, and the faces of the three marines who travelled with you from Cape Kabar.

You can feel the balloon is rapidly losing altitude and, when you peer over the rim of the basket, you see the trees of the lower mountain slopes rising towards you at a dizzying speed. Yranai pulls himself up beside you, but when he sees shreds of cloth trailing from the punctured canopy above, he faints and collapses. Hurriedly you haul his frail body over your shoulder. Then you place one foot on the rim of the basket and get ready to make a desperate leap away from this doomed balloon as the top of the mountain pines come clearly into view.</p>

       <p>You ride the moonlit coast road, covering the remaining 25 miles to Bir Rabalou in little more than three hours. Your first glimpse of the great trading port comes when the road crests a ridge of hills within a mile of its perimeter wall. From here you can see that the city is built in a semicircle between two great jutting spurs of land which protrude into the ocean like the horns of a huge bull. Within the city wall are hundreds of lavish buildings, yet the grandest of all is a castle which stands upon a steep hill at its centre. This one towering stronghold dominates all the other splendid structures of this rich metropolis.</p>
       <p>Your arrival at the north gate at such a late hour is greeted with suspicion from a pair of surly guards. Eventually you are allowed to enter, but only after Oswin bribes them with the horse that Oriah once rode. Beyond the gate you ride along a torchlit avenue which leads down to the harbour; this is filled with trading ships of all nationalities. The quayside and its taverns are alive with activity as the captains and crews of these vessels drink themselves senseless with the money their cargoes have earned.</p>
       <p>You select one of the quieter taverns and stable your horses at the rear before making your entrance. The tavern<ch.apos/>s taproom is crowded with sailors and traders, most of whom are listening to an uncommonly fine musical performance being given by three Cloeasian minstrels. Your companions are hungry and tired and so you make your way to the counter and ask the tavern-keeper his price for food and a night<ch.apos/>s lodging. He tells you that 10 Gold Crowns will fill all your bellies and buy you each the use of a comfortable room. You agree to his price (deduct 10 Gold Crowns from your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>) and he hands each of you a numbered key.

You pull free, but in doing so you destroy one item in your pack (erase from your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a> the item which you have recorded last on your list of Backpack Items).</p>
       <p>You drop to the street beyond and follow it to a tree-lined plaza which is bordered by shops that sell rare artefacts and expensive works of art. Their windows and doors are securely barred and shuttered and show no signs of a forced entry. Then your eye is drawn to a grand building on the far side of the plaza: it is a temple. Its great stone door is closed, but a smaller wooden door at the side has been torn off its hinges. You magnify your vision and see that beyond the door is a flight of stone steps which ascend to a bell-tower.</p>
       <p>Cautiously you approach the shattered door. You unsheathe your weapon and scan the darkened stairs before silently you move up the steps. You have climbed twenty steps when suddenly you hear a hideous snickering growl and an icy chill runs the length of your spine. There is an ominous creak of stone on stone and a movement in the darkness above, and then a crashing fills your ears. Out of the darkness you see a great marble statue come smashing down the narrow stairway. It rapidly gathers speed as it tumbles end-over-end towards you.</p>

       <p>Dressed in the plain green tunic, breeches, and cloak of a Kai journeyman, you return to the Vault of the Sun at midnight as ordered. Lone Wolf approves of your appearance and commends you for your determination to succeed. He is confident he has chosen the right Grand Master to fulfil this vital mission. He opens a concealed portal in the wall of the chamber and he motions you to follow him as he steps through into a torchlit tunnel. This secret passage passes under the walls of the monastery and emerges at a clearing in the surrounding Fryelund Forest. Here awaits a party of men and horses<ch.emdash/><ch.eacute/>lite troopers from King Ulnar<ch.apos/>s Court Cavalry Regiment. Lone Wolf bids you good luck and godspeed as you climb into the saddle of a chestnut mare and, with a proud salute, you bid farewell to your leader before galloping away with the horsemen along a moonlit forest track.</p>
       <p>Your bodyguard of King<ch.apos/>s troopers have orders to ensure that you reach Holmgard harbour swiftly and safely; they know nothing about your mission. You ride all night and enter the capital shortly after dawn, whereupon you are escorted through the awakening streets to the harbour where <cite>The Pride of Sommerlund</cite>, an armed caravel, is moored alongside the stone quay. From its mainmast flies a red flag emblazoned with a golden galleon and a five-pointed crown. It is the Holmgard ensign, the flag of this city<ch.apos/>s trading fleet. As you rein your mare to a halt, you cast your eyes along the ship<ch.apos/>s deck and note that it is equipped with several light swivel cannon mounted upon the gunwales. It is uncommon for traders to be armed, even those that venture regularly into the Kuri Sea which is notorious for its brigands and pirate raiders. Your voyage is destined to traverse these perilous waters and so the unexpected sight of the ship<ch.apos/>s guns comes as a welcome surprise.</p>

       <p>A bristle-bearded First Mate called Paoll is on dawn watch and he beckons you to come aboard. Your cavalry escort, having delivered you safely to the quay, now bid you a safe voyage and depart from the harbour with your horse in tow. Paoll welcomes you and offers to show you to your cabin. He says that the ship<ch.apos/>s master, Captain Raker, is still ashore after having spent last night celebrating at the Good Cheer Inn. He says he was due back at dawn, yet he does not appear to be particularly concerned by his absence. It is not uncommon for Captain Raker to be late back from shore leave, especially when he and his crew are to embark on a long voyage.

He pauses to emit a long loud belch, and then he repeats his offer of a place aboard his ship which sails for Bisutan at noon. The marines do not object to you leaving them if you so wish.

       <p>You enter the right alley and the militia, who are following closely, split into two groups. Roughly half their number searches the other alley whilst the remainder stays with you.</p>
       <p>As you are running along this narrow thoroughfare, suddenly you hear the sound of splintering timbers somewhere in the distance. A hundred yards later the alley opens out into a tree-lined plaza which is bordered by shops selling rare artefacts of the Old Kingdom, and expensive works of art. Their windows and doors are securely barred and shuttered and show no signs of a forced entry. Then your eye is drawn to a grand building on the far side of the plaza: it is a temple. Its great stone door is closed, but a smaller wooden door at the side has been torn off its hinges. You magnify your vision and see that beyond the door is a flight of stone steps which ascend to a bell-tower.</p>
       <p>Cautiously you approach the shattered door. You unsheathe your weapon and scan the darkened stairs before silently ascending the steps. You have climbed twenty steps when suddenly you hear a hideous snickering growl and an icy chill runs the length of your spine. There is an ominous creak of stone on stone and a movement in the darkness above, and then a crashing fills your ears. Out of the darkness you see a great marble statue come smashing down the narrow stairway. It rapidly gathers speed as it tumbles end-over-end towards you.</p>

The leading pirate ship has now closed to within fifty yards and its murderous crew are crowded shoulder-to-shoulder upon its forward deck. Clearly they intend to leap aboard as soon as their ship draws alongside. From your position beside the deck rail you can see Sergeant Dryan directing his men at the bow. Dryan<ch.apos/>s marines are busily loading the three swivel cannon which are fixed to the port gunwale. Once loaded, each marine gunner raises his hand to signal that his piece is primed to fire. Dryan is waiting for the third gunner to signal. He is ready to give the order to fire when suddenly there is a thunderous roar and a puff of grey smoke erupts unexpectedly from the prow of the attacking ship.</p>

       <p>You think back to the months that you spent studying the Discipline of Deliverance at the Kai Monastery, and you try to recall what you can about the illness known as Bita Fever.</p>
       <p>It is a highly contagious airborne disease that originated in the Bita Swamp of Dessi. In humans it is usually only fatal in the very young or the old; healthy adults rarely die from it, although the symptoms in those affected are uncomfortable and unsightly. Victims suffer from a corpse-like pallor and can sometimes develop a vivid scarlet rash that particularly affects the face, feet, and hands. Gradually a normally healthy person who contracts the disease will develop an immunity to it after fifteen to twenty days, and outbreaks of Bita Fever in towns and cities have rarely been known to last longer than a month.</p>
       <p>When you look at the faces of the mourners you notice that many of them exhibit the symptoms of Bita Fever. The marines have never before encountered this tropical disease, and when you inform them of what you know, they insist on leaving the town at once, before the quarantine is put into force.</p>

It is customary for the winner of the final combat of the circus to be granted one request, and you ask that you may be allowed to go free. Torvax nods in agreement. He is grieved by the loss of his warrior-slave Malduz, but he does not hold you responsible for his death.</p>
       <p>Before he instructs his men to escort you to the gates of the arena and let you go free, he hands you a silk pouch containing 20 Gold Crowns. (If you had a Bow confiscated before the combat with Dromodon, this is returned to you on your way out of the arena.)</p>

       <p>Gradually the temperature drops and the gentle undulation of the waves grows fiercer. The wind becomes a gale and the azure sky grows darker and darker until the sun is lost from view and the ship is shrouded by a deep grey twilight. Now Kol realizes that he should have heeded your advice and he commands his anxious crew to run for the coast in the hope of finding a safe haven. Soon lightning is the only source of illumination. It tears the roiling clouds and transforms the sea into an angry beast that lashes and batters the ship with a supernatural fury. Then the darkness is obliterated by a great curtain of white fire. Tongues of flame lance down; they boil the sea where they strike the surface and send up great clouds of steam in their wake. Miraculously these terrifying bolts of power miss the ship, but soon they are rivalled in their ferocity by another terrifying force that is battling to escape from the hellish skies.</p>
       <p>A hundred balls of dancing fire fall from the clouds like a shower of blazing meteors. One such meteor strikes the helmsman who is struggling with the ship<ch.apos/>s wheel, and it engulfs him. For a few dreadful moments his head and chest are contained within a roaring yellow orb; then the burning ball is caught by the wind and it spins away into the darkness. The crew scream with terror when they look upon their comrade, for his upper body has been transformed into a blackened and fleshless skull that perches precariously upon his hollow, smoking rib cage.</p>
       <p>Panic grips the Vassagonian sailors. They abandon their posts and rush to seek shelter below deck in the crowded cargo hold. You are trying to rally them when suddenly a ball of flame drops from the raging skies and comes hurtling down towards your head.</p>

       <p>It is approaching noon when you arrive at a junction where the coast road splits in two. Ahead of you are the gentle foothills of the Koneshi Mountains, and beyond them you glimpse the snowy peaks of that great range rising majestically into the cloudless sky.

       <p>The deck of <cite>The Pride of Sommerlund</cite> becomes a hive of activity as the crew sets about getting the ship ready to sail. When the last spread of canvas has been unfurled and the cables are cast off from the quayside, you feel the deck rock gently as Paoll steers the cargo-heavy vessel towards the entrance to Holmgard harbour. At first she responds sluggishly and the First Mate curses her as he struggles with the ship<ch.apos/>s wheel. Yet, once you pass beyond the harbour<ch.apos/>s protective walls, a sea wind fills the sails and the ship is swiftly transformed. Within minutes of leaving harbour, <cite>The Pride of Sommerlund</cite> is speeding swiftly eastwards through the foam-flecked waters of the Holmgulf.</p>
       <p>For six uneventful days you sail across the Gulf of Durenor, the passage made easy by fair weather and a strong following wind. After a night<ch.apos/>s anchorage at Port Bax, the voyage continues along the Rymerift and into the warm, turquoise waters of the Kuri Sea. Shortly after dawn of the thirteenth day, an island looms into view on the horizon. Its white sandy beaches and rich vegetation appear innocuous, but Captain Raker informs you that it is one of the notorious Lakuri Isles. For centuries the bays and hidden coves of the Lakuris have provided a safe haven for pirates, the most infamous of whom was Captain Khadro. Six years ago this murderous buccaneer was slain by your master, Lone Wolf, yet despite his demise the Lakuri Islands still harbour renegades and pirates who have set up camp here during the past year. Captain Raker scours the horizon with his telescope, seeking a tell-tale glimpse of sail among the inlets and coves which pepper the shoreline. During his last voyage he came close to losing his ship in these waters and he is understandably wary.</p>

       <p>You accompany Captain Raker as he conducts a hasty tour of his ravaged ship to assess the extent of the battle damage, and you are both shocked when you discover that half his complement of crew have been killed or badly wounded. The few who can still stand count themselves lucky to have survived. Raker sets Paoll and some of the survivors to work repairing the gaping hole in the ship<ch.apos/>s port beam that was made by the enemy<ch.apos/>s ram, while the remainder tend to their wounded companions and clear away the debris that lies smouldering in heaps upon the bloodstained deck. Among the enemy dead you are saddened to discover the bodies of young Sergeant Dryan and nine of his men. Only three marines have survived the battle and stoically they set about wrapping the bodies of their fallen comrades in canvas and consigning them to the waves.</p>
       <p>Having done what you can to help on deck, you decide to go below and make sure that Fernant and Oriah are safe. At the foot of the steps you discover a dead raider lying sprawled across the body of another man. You turn the corpse over with the toe of your boot and gasp when you see that the man lying beneath is Lord-lieutenant Fernant. The hilt of a Shadakine dagger protrudes from his chest and a smear of blood stains his lips. He is dead. Fearing the worst, you rush along the narrow corridor and throw open the door to Oriah<ch.apos/>s cabin. You find her huddled below her bunk, sobbing quietly. You comfort her as best you can but she is overcome with grief; Fernant died whilst protecting her and she blames herself for his death and for the calamity which has befallen <cite>The Pride of Sommerlund</cite>. She tells you that the raiders came from Ghol-Tabras, the city ruled by her evil suitor. She is convinced that the reason they attacked the ship was to capture her.</p>
       <p>At length you persuade Oriah to accompany you onto the rear deck for some fresh air. Here you are met by Captain Raker who informs you that the ship is listing and taking in water. The voyage to Bisutan cannot proceed until proper repairs have been carried out, and so he has set a course for the nearby port of Cape Kabar where he knows a trustworthy shipwright who can fix the damaged hull. While you talk with the captain, Oriah watches the surviving crewmen disposing of the enemy dead. You hear her gasp, and when you hurry to her side you see that she is pointing at the body of the warrior leader.</p>

       <p>The militia have orders to impose the curfew and arrest anyone caught on the streets after dark. As you march alongside the young lieutenant on your way to the city<ch.apos/>s guardhouse, you ask him why such stern measures have been imposed, especially in Hikas which is considered to be one of the most peaceful and civilized cities of Magnamund.</p>
       <p><quote>The people of Hikas are living in fear of their lives,</quote> says the lieutenant. <quote>For the past month there<ch.apos/>s been a creature stalking our streets at night.

       <p>Upon emerging from the Bukimi Channel, <cite>The Pride of Sommerlund</cite> is caught by a strong northeasterly wind which propels her swiftly towards the Vassagonian coast. For two days and nights she rides the scudding waves, her speedy passage more than making up for any time lost in the Lakuri Isles. Then, late on the third day, the lookout catches his first glimpse of Barrakeesh. Excitedly the crew gather on deck to stare at the golden domes and towers of the city which glimmer like orbs of burnished gold in the glow of the setting sun. In fading light, Paoll brings the ship silently into the great curve of Barrakeesh harbour and moors her at the end of a vacant quay. Few eyes notice another trade ship, but one pair takes a special interest. They belong to Lord-lieutenant Fernant, the Sommlending envoy to this rich, desert realm. When finally the ship is docked and the gangplank is lowered to the quayside, he is waiting there to greet your arrival.</p>
       <p>Fernant is a tall man in his mid-forties, clean-shaven, and of slim and athletic build. His face has characteristics which are unmistakably Sommlending, yet his skin is richly tanned from the many years he has spent in this sun-drenched land. After a brief talk with Captain Raker to confirm that the ship will be ready to sail tomorrow at noon, he offers you the hospitality of his house in the city. After nearly a month at sea, you gladly welcome the chance to bathe in a proper bath and sleep in a proper bed.</p>
       <p>Fernant<ch.apos/>s house is only a short distance from the harbour. It is a large, two-storey dwelling with a flat roof and a walled garden that smells sweetly of picanda and larnuma fruit. After a luxurious bath and a feast fit for a king, Fernant tells you something about the changes which have occurred in Vassagonia since the demise of its hated ruler<ch.emdash/>Zakhan Kimah<ch.emdash/>who, during the Darklands War, allied himself and his reluctant nation to the Darklords of Helgedad.</p>
       <p><quote>Shoualli is the new Zakhan now,</quote> says Fernant, as he peels the skin from a ripe larnuma and slices it neatly in two with a pearl-handled dagger. <quote>He is an honourable and intelligent man. He has brought peace back to this land through trade. Its enemies, who once swore to destroy Vassagonia, now come and barter their wares in the rich markets of Barrakeesh and Bisutan.</quote> Later during the evening, talk turns to the details of your mission. Fernant is unaware of its true purpose; all he knows is that he is to offer you every assistance to ensure your swift and safe passage to Elzian. When you tell him that you are not at liberty to discuss your mission fully, he nods sympathetically and vows he will refrain from ever mentioning the subject again.</p>
       <p>Shortly before midnight there is a knock at the front door of Fernant<ch.apos/>s house. He signals to one of his servants to go and answer it and you comment that it is an uncommonly late hour for someone to be paying him a visit. <quote>Quite so,</quote> he says, <quote>but this is a visitor I<ch.apos/>ve been expecting. It<ch.apos/>s someone I<ch.apos/>d especially like you to meet.</quote></p>

       <p>The crowd scream with excitement the moment you overcome the last of the evil slaver<ch.apos/>s henchmen. At first you think they are expressing their appreciation of your superb Kai fighting skills, but then you notice a large shadow is moving across the market square and when you look up you discover the real cause of the crowd<ch.apos/>s excitation.</p>
       <p>Swooping down out of the cloudless sky come two gigantic birds with razor-sharp beaks and talons that glint like mirrored steel. They are Itikars and seated astride their feathered backs are warriors armed with spears and shields. Frantically the slaver signals to the riders and one of them responds by hurling his weapon at your head. You dive to avoid being skewered to the ground by this deadly missile and it thuds harmlessly into the beaten earth, but as you are pulling yourself to your feet, you see the second Itikar come swooping down towards Oriah. You scream a warning yet she is frozen with fear and does not respond. The great bird sweeps past her and its rider casts a lasso which falls over her head. As the bird soars into the sky the rope tightens about her waist and she is hoisted screaming into the air. You spring to your feet and race after her as she is carried away over the rooftops of Kilij, and as you sprint across the square you see a dozen armed men emerge from the crowd to block your path. The Itikar and its precious cargo are rapidly disappearing towards the northern hills and you know in your heart that it is now too late to save Oriah. Then you hear the sound of cruel laughter echoing across the square and it brings you skidding to a halt. It is the laugh of the slaver: he can barely contain his delight at having captured such a beautiful young woman, and he is relishing the thought of watching as the remainder of his henchmen make you pay for the deaths of their comrades.</p>

       <p>You are woken early the following morning by the motion of the carriage. As you rub your eyes and stretch your aching limbs, your fellow passengers tell you that the caravan has been on the move for more than an hour. They are eating a breakfast of bread and fruit which they generously offer to share with you.</p>
       <p>It is almost noon when the stone town of Bavari looms into view. Most of its sun-bleached shops and houses are contained within a wall of uncemented stone blocks which rise to twice the height of a horse. The road approaches a heavy wooden gate, banded and studded with iron, which is flanked by circular guard towers. Perforating the walls are slits for archers and openings for larger machines of war.</p>
       <p>The procession of wagons passes through the gate and comes to a halt in the middle of Bavari. As you disembark you sense an air of excitement pervading this town. You overhear the other passengers talking and you learn that today is the third day of the Bavarian gladiatorial circus<ch.emdash/>an annual event which attracts the finest warriors of Vassagonia to come here and compete with each other in armed combat. Great wealth and status are the rewards for those who triumph; disgrace and sometimes death await those who fail.</p>
       <p>You are curious to see this great event and so you follow a group of passengers to Bavari<ch.apos/>s arena where the gladiatorial circus is being staged. Entrance to the arena is free and you take a seat on one of the many stone tiers that encircle its oval-shaped fighting area. Throughout the afternoon several combats are staged between warriors on foot and on horseback. The heat of the desert sun is unrelenting, and by late afternoon you are feeling parched. During a lull in the contests, you hear the tinkling sound of running water and you decide to seek out its source. You descend to the edge of the fighting area and enter a tunnel which passes beneath the tiers of seats. Halfway along this cool tunnel is an open door set into the whitewashed wall. Through the doorway you see a bronze fountain standing in the middle of an empty room. It is richly embellished with engravings which depict ancient gladiatorial contests, and a stream of sparkling water issues upwards from a nozzle at its centre, inviting you to drink.</p>
       <p>You are desperate to slake your thirst and so you enter the room and stoop over the fountain. You are swallowing the deliciously cool water when suddenly you sense someone rushing at you from behind.</p>

       <p>You enjoy a restful sleep at the hostel and you wake at daybreak to the sound of voices and the crashing of iron pots and pans. Your room is located above the kitchens and through the cracks in the bamboo floor you can see the owner and his wife preparing food for breakfast. You put on your cloak and gather up your equipment before going down to the paddock to collect your horse. The hostel-keeper waves farewell from the kitchen window as you mount your horse and canter away across the courtyard.</p>

       <p>The marines load and fire three volleys at the cliff-top. You watch the target area and your Sixth Sense tells you that their shots, although they do not hit the creature directly, pass close enough to scare it. With relief, you sense the unseen creature is retreating in the face of this barrage and, as it abandons its sorcerous attack, so the whirlpool ahead ceases to spin violently.</p>
       <p>As the waters of the channel return to normal, Raker commends the marines for their gunnery skills. Then he commands his crew to unfurl every remaining square inch of canvas. The sails catch the prevailing winds and carry the ship swiftly through the narrow channel and away from the menacing shadow of the cliffs.</p>

       <p>The incident at the tavern and the loss of your horse leave you feeling angry and confused. For more than an hour you walk the dark, deserted streets of Hikas as you struggle to make sense of what has happened. You are passing a junction where the cobblestoned street joins with a larger avenue, when suddenly you hear the approaching tramp of booted feet. A stern but anxious voice calls out, commanding you to halt, and when you peer into the darkness you see a dozen Vakeros militiamen. They are armed with spears and throwing nets, and they are standing in a line abreast to seal off the avenue.</p>

       <p>You move nearer to the trembling man and try to calm him with soothing words and a promise that you will protect him. You look to the bell and use your Sixth Sense in an attempt to locate the creature, but you can detect nothing unusual. Then you hear a faint gurgling growl and a knot of fear tightens in your throat. Now you can detect a powerful aura of evil. You glance at the cowering cleric and your fear becomes an icy terror when you realize that <em>he</em> is the source of this evil. He continues to plead with you to save him, but then he sees the shock register on your face and he abandons his pretence.</p>
       <p>The pupils of his eyes shimmer and become spheres that glow darkly amber and, in a terrifying instant, his body transforms. One moment he is a bearded holy man and, in a split-second blur, he becomes a snarling hulk of black-furred death. With breathtaking speed he leaps at you and slashes at your throat with his razor-sharp talons. Instinct makes you propel yourself backwards to avoid these deadly claws and, as you spring away, you slip and tumble headlong down the spiral stairs.</p>

       <p>Skilfully you ascend the rigging and approach the giant spider from behind and below. It is busily tearing at the mast and topsail with its fanged maw, and at first it fails to notice you. When you pause for a few moments to unsheathe your weapon, suddenly the creature swivels its head and fixes you with a pair of ghastly green eyes. Chittering excitedly, it rubs its forelegs together and sparks appear, warning you that it is preparing to launch a bolt of energy. Quickly you cut free a trailing rope and swing away from the rigging just in time to avoid being burnt to a cinder when it launches its burst of crackling blue fire. Your swift reflexes save you, but as the momentum of your swing carries you back towards the rigging, you see that the creature is preparing a new form of attack.</p>
       <p>It waits until you come to rest upon the criss-cross of ropes and then it ejects a stream of sickly grey fluid from a sac located below its gaping maw. This fluid hardens as it passes through the air, and is transformed into several long and sticky strands which threaten to engulf you.</p>

When a section of the handrail immediately falls away and is lost in the mountains below, it does not readily inspire your confidence in this craft or its pilot. Sheepishly, Yranai plays with the valves of the engine and the balloon drifts to the east, towards some more distant but lesser peaks where the air is calmer. He gives you a wry grin and you give thanks to Kai and Ishir that he has heeded your warning.</p>

       <p>The faces of your three companions are covered by an unsightly red rash. Each man is suffering a headache and they feel nauseous and dizzy, yet these discomforts fade after you attend to them using your Kai curing skills. However, try as you may, you cannot relieve them of the vivid rash that has erupted all over their faces, hands, and feet.</p>
       <p>With dismay, the three men resign themselves to the fact that they have contracted Bita Fever. Although their lives are not at risk, the inflammation of their skin is causing them great discomfort. Their only hope of easing the persistent irritation is for them to reach Bisutan and find an apothecary who may be able to concoct a lotion to soothe their purulent skin.</p>
       <p>You ride all day under a clear sky and a blazing sun and stoically the marines suffer their pain in silence. Their only relief is the protection afforded by their cool, flowing <foreign xml:lang="x-vassagonian">mhaktis</foreign>. It is late in the afternoon when you catch your first sight of the great city of Bisutan, which is located upon an island in the estuary of the River Khorda. A titanic stone bridge carries the coastal road over the shimmering waters of the Khorda towards a towering gatehouse which is flanked by two massive stone dragons. It is not the custom of Bisutan<ch.apos/>s city guards to stop travellers without good reason, for here the merchants of all Magnamund meet to haggle and trade and barter their cargoes. They allow you to pass through their great gate, but one sharp-eyed young guardsman with promotion on his mind notes the strange pallor of your companions and he demands that they halt.</p>
       <p><quote>Bita Fever,</quote> proclaims a gruff old guard sergeant, and he demands that they dismount at once. He summons five spearmen from a nearby guardhouse and when they arrive he orders that your companions be taken to a gaol on the far side of the great bridge. You protest but the sergeant is adamant that they should spend a month there in isolation until the symptoms of the fever have disappeared. He assures you that they will be treated well, but they will not be permitted any visitors during their isolation. As they are escorted back across the bridge at spear<ch.apos/>s length, they wave you farewell and urge you to continue your journey without them. You wait until they have disappeared from view and then you wheel your horse about and enter Bisutan alone.</p>

Yranai looks up to see shreds of cloth trailing from the punctured canopy above and the sight proves too much for him: he faints. Hurriedly you haul his frail body over your shoulder. Then you place one foot on the rim of the basket and get ready to make a desperate leap away from this doomed balloon as the tops of the mountain pines come into view.</p>

       <p>The ship leaves Barrakeesh on the noon tide and makes swift progress ahead of a favourable southerly wind. But by dusk the wind has dropped, and Raker decides to spend the first night at anchor in a protected cove a few miles to the east of Chula.

       <p>To your surprise you see that the attacking ship is armed with a large cannon, mounted on the prow. Moments after the pirates fire their gun, you hear the whistle of a heavy cannonball as it hurtles across the deck of <cite>The Pride of Sommerlund</cite>. Fortunately the pirates are poor gunners and it passes within inches of the mainmast before splashing harmlessly into the ocean. Sergeant Dryan commands his men to return fire and a volley of shots from the three swivel guns slams into the bow of the pirate ship with devastating effect. Two shots penetrate below the waterline and the third severs the bowsprit. As it falls into the ocean, it rips away sail and rigging which drag more than a dozen pirates overboard. In disarray, the enemy vessel veers from its collision course and founders in the wake of <cite>The Pride of Sommerlund</cite> as it enters the Bukimi Channel. Here your ship picks up a prevailing wind which propels it away from the second pirate raider. Soon both ships have disappeared and, when Raker is sure that the danger has passed, he warmly praises both the marines and his crew for the skill and courage they have displayed.</p>

This is Kita Cove, formerly a secret base from where Captain Khadro launched his pirate fleet. As you stare at the charred remnants of the pirate settlement, you try to imagine what it must have looked like before the encampment was consumed by a tremendous fireball that sealed its doom.

       <p>Beyond this sign the coast road ascends into an expanse of arid hill country which is populated by herds of wild goats. To the east you occasionally glimpse the ocean beyond the barren hills, while to the west you can see a range of distant mountains, their snowy peaks glistening stark-white beneath the fierce desert sun. Shortly before noon you happen upon the town of Kilij which lies in a narrow pass between two steep hillsides. Oriah and the marines are tired and sore after the long night<ch.apos/>s ride and they urge you to stop here so that they may eat and rest awhile. Together you ride into the town<ch.apos/>s busy market square and dismount at a stone water trough where you allow your horses to drink their fill.

       <p>You run with the militia along the narrow twisting streets towards the south quarter of Hikas, where the town houses of wealthy merchants command expensive views of the River Carcos. Again a shriek pierces the darkness, but this time it is echoed by a terrible inhuman howl. <quote>The beast!</quote> gasps the lieutenant, and he turns to rally his men onwards. Soon the street ahead meets a towpath which runs along the river bank, and you slow your pace so you can turn the corner. As you do so, you see a man dressed in his nightclothes leaning from the open window of a house close by. He appears to be in shock for he is sobbing and clutching fitfully at his dishevelled hair. You stop and call to him and slowly he responds. He sees you through his tears and points frantically to several small bundles lying on the towpath beside the gangplank to a barge. The lieutenant rushes past you and hurries to the first bundle. You see him drop to his knees and shake his head in disbelief, and then he turns away and retches. You magnify your vision and see, to your horror, what the bundles really are. They are the shredded remains of two men, two traders who have been dragged from their beds aboard their barge and torn limb from limb by some nameless creature of the night.</p>
       <p>Desperately you scan the towpath and the buildings which stand all along the river bank. Then you see something and your heart skips a beat. In the darkness of a narrow alleyway two amber eyes glint in the moonlight. You sharpen your focus and catch the faintest glimpse of a dark shape loping away.</p>
       <p><quote>There!</quote> you shout, and you give chase, with the city militiamen and the lieutenant following after. The passageway twists and turns like an angry snake before it ends abruptly at a junction where a wider alley crosses it from left to right. Quickly you drop to your knees and summon your tracking skills in an effort to determine which way the creature went.</p>

       <p>Your refusal to pay infuriates the toll collector. He brandishes his sword at you and threatens to cut off your ears. The marines laugh at his bravado; they are in no doubt who would end up the loser if he was foolish enough to pick a fight with you. Their disparaging laughter wounds his pride and you sense that he is about to fly into a blind rage. Using your psychic Kai powers, you cool his anger and persuade him to put away his sword. He does so, and politely now he asks that you pay a toll of 4 Gold Crowns to cross the bridge. With a nod of your head you indicate to your companions that this is a fair price and you each hand him 1 Gold Crown apiece (deduct this 1 Gold Crown from your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>; if you have no money you must erase one Backpack Item instead).</p>

       <p>The reduced toll charge does not include a night<ch.apos/>s lodging at the inn and so you ride through the village and set up camp on a wooded slope a mile beyond.

At first light you strike camp and continue your ride through the Koneshi Pass.</p>

       <p>The pirate leader gasps his last breath and then crashes lifelessly to the deck. For a few moments his men stand transfixed with shock, as if they are unable to comprehend that he is truly dead. Then the reality of their loss crashes in upon them and they become overwhelmed by the worst of their fears. Leaderless and alone, they scream like frightened children and discard their weapons and armour in their haste to escape from your ship.</p>
       <p>Captain Raker orders his surviving crew members to cut the grappling lines which hold the two vessels together. When the last rope is severed there is a great rending of iron and timber as the ram of the pirate ship wrenches itself free from <cite>The Pride of Sommerlund</cite><ch.apos/>s port side. Then a cheer resounds from the mouths of those Sommlending who have survived this desperate battle when they see the enemy ship turn about and flee for the safety of the isles off Cape Kabar.

       <p>Consciousness returns through a kaleidoscopic swirl of colour and pain (lose 4 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points). Bruised and aching, you pull yourself into a sitting position and see the wreckage of the balloon hanging among the trees and scattered across the rocks nearby. A few feet away lies Yranai; he is still unconscious and you see at once that his left leg is badly broken. Gingerly you pull yourself over to his side and you are about to examine his injured leg when you hear voices calling you from among the trees. Three Vakeros natives appear from out of the pines and come hurrying over the rocks towards you. You examine the old magician and discover that he has stopped breathing: he is near to death. It is only through the use of your Kai curing skills that you are able to make him breathe again and bring him back from the edge of the abyss. You set his fractured leg but, despite your best efforts, you cannot return him to consciousness.</p>
       <p>The three Vakeros tell you that they know Yranai and they offer to take care of him. They construct a makeshift stretcher from their coats and carry him to their settlement which is less than a mile distant. You stay here this night and use your healing skills to save the old man<ch.apos/>s leg before you eventually settle down to a few hours<ch.apos/> sleep. At dawn you awake to find him still unconscious. You are anxious to continue your journey, and yet you feel compelled to help Yranai regain his health. You talk with the Vakeros and tell them that you must leave and they assure you that Yranai is safe with them. They promise to take good care of him. They also offer to give you one of their sturdy mountain horses, an old mare called Jhani, to help speed your journey southwards. Gratefully you accept their generous offer and then you bid them farewell before you leave their settlement by way of a mountain track.</p>
       <p>It is around noon of the following day when the track finally emerges from the foothills of the Great Masourn Mountains and joins the coast road some thirty miles from Hikas. In the distance you see a village and you ride towards it. At first the villagers seem as friendly and as peaceable as the mountain dwellers who gave you your horse, but the moment they see you approaching they immediately freeze in their tracks. Some drop the items they are carrying and others begin to tremble with fear.</p>

       <p>After having stripped to your undergarments and locked your tunic and equipment safely away in your cabin, you join Oriah at the bow of the ship where you prepare to enter the sea together. Fernant and Raker watch from the forward deck as the two of you leap into the warm waters of the cove and make your first dive upon the wreck. Oriah is a strong swimmer, and you can tell by the effortless way she descends through the water that she is a skilled diver.</p>
       <p>The galleon is broken at its centre and lies with its fore and aft sections separated by an expanse of debris-strewn sand.

       <p>You and Oriah climb the stone steps and return to the marines who are now hiding among the boulders at the edge of the plateau. Ernan tells you that during your absence he watched the riders pass by the entrance to the hill track and continue along the coast road for several miles. Just a few minutes before you arrived, these same riders came galloping back along the road towards Cape Kabar. He is convinced that they have called off the chase and have decided to return to their town.</p>
       <p>Now that the threat has passed, you and your companions remount your horses and leave the plateau. You ride all night along the empty coast road and cover many miles. Shortly after dawn you pass a stone signpost pointing to the south. Carved into its surface is the following message written in ancient Vassagonian script: <quote>Bir Rabalou<ch.emdash/>160 miles</quote>.</p>
       <p>Beyond this sign the coast road ascends into an expanse of arid hill country which is populated by herds of wild goats. To the east you occasionally glimpse the ocean beyond the barren hills, while to the west you can see a range of distant mountains, their snowy peaks glistening stark-white beneath the fierce desert sun. Shortly before noon you happen upon the town of Kilij which lies in a narrow pass between two steep hillsides. Oriah and the marines are tired and sore after the long night<ch.apos/>s ride and they urge you to stop here so that they might eat and rest awhile. Together you ride into the town<ch.apos/>s busy market square and dismount at a stone water trough where you allow your horses to drink their fill. Around you the mood of the townspeople is friendly as they barter and trade their wares. A young boy offers to look after your horses while you visit the market. Initially you are suspicious of his motives until your Sixth Sense confirms that he is an honest lad, and one worthy of your trust. Oriah gives him a Gold Crown and his face beams with joy<ch.emdash/>he<ch.apos/>ll be able to eat well this week!</p>
