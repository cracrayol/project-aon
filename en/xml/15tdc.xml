    <p>You are Grand Master Lone Wolf, last of the Kai Lords of Sommerlund and sole survivor of a massacre that wiped out the First Order of your <ch.eacute/>lite warrior caste.</p>
    <p>It is the year MS<ch.nbsp/>5076 and twenty-six years have passed since your brave kinsmen perished at the hands of the Darklords of Helgedad. These champions of evil, who were sent forth by Naar, the King of the Darkness, to destroy the fertile world of Magnamund, have themselves since been destroyed. You vowed to avenge the murder of the Kai and you kept your pledge, for it was you who brought about their downfall when alone you infiltrated their foul domain<ch.emdash/>the Darklands<ch.emdash/>and caused the destruction of their leader, Archlord Gnaag, and the seat of his power that was the infernal city of Helgedad.</p>
    <p>In the wake of their destruction, chaos befell the Darkland armies who, until then, had been poised to conquer all of Northern Magnamund. Some factions which were part of this huge army, most notably the barbaric Drakkarim, began to fight with the others for control. This disorder quickly escalated into an all-out civil war, which allowed the Freeland armies of Magnamund time in which to recover and launch a counter-offensive. Skilfully their commanders exploited the chaos and secured a swift and total victory over an enemy far superior in numbers.</p>
    <p>For six years now peace has reigned in Sommerlund. Under your direction, the once-ruined Monastery of the Kai has been thoroughly rebuilt and restored to its former glory, and the task of teaching a Second Order of Kai warriors the skills and proud traditions of your ancestors is also well under way. The new generation of Kai recruits, all of whom were born during the era of war against the Darklords, possess latent Kai skills and all show exceptional promise. These skills will be nurtured and honed to perfection during their time at the monastery so that they may teach and inspire future generations, thereby ensuring the continued security of your homeland in future years.</p>
    <p>Your attainment of the rank of Kai Grand Master brought with it great rewards. Some, such as the restoration of the Kai and the undying gratitude of your fellow Sommlending, could have been anticipated. Yet there have also been rewards which you could not possibly have foreseen. The discovery that within you lay the potential to develop Kai Disciplines beyond those of the Magnakai, which, until now, were thought to be the ultimate that a Kai Master could aspire to, was truly a revelation. Your discovery has inspired you to set out upon a new and previously unknown path in search of the wisdom and power that no Kai Lord before you has ever possessed. In the name of your creator, the God Kai, and for the greater glory of Sommerlund and the Goddess Ishir, you have vowed to reach the very pinnacle of Kai perfection<ch.emdash/>to attain all of the Grand Master Disciplines and become the first Kai Supreme Master.</p>
    <p>With diligence and determination you set about the restoration of the Kai Monastery and organized the training of the Second Order recruits. Your efforts were soon rewarded and, within the space of two short years, the first raw recruits had graduated to become a cadre of gifted Kai Masters who, in turn, were able to commence the teaching of their skills to subsequent intakes of Kai novices. Readily the Kai Masters rose to their newfound responsibilities, leaving you free to devote more of your time to the pursuit and perfection of the Grand Master Disciplines. During this period you also received expert tutelage in the ways of magic from two of your most trusted friends and advisors: Guildmaster Banedon, leader of the Brotherhood of the Crystal Star, and Lord Rimoah, speaker for the High Council of the Elder Magi.</p>
    <p>In the deepest subterranean level of the monastery, one hundred feet below the Tower of the Sun, you ordered the excavation and construction of a special vault. In this magnificent chamber wrought of granite and gold, you placed the seven Lorestones of Nyxator, the gems of Kai power that you had rediscovered during your quest for the Magnakai. It was here, bathed in the golden light of those radiant gems, that you spent countless hours in pursuit of perfection. Sometimes alone, sometimes in the company of your two most able advisors<ch.emdash/>Banedon and Rimoah<ch.emdash/>you worked hard to develop your innate Grand Master Disciplines, and grasp the fundamental secrets of Left-handed and Old Kingdom magic. During this time you noticed many remarkable changes taking place within your body: you became physically and mentally stronger, your five primary senses sharpened beyond all that you had experienced before, and, perhaps most remarkably, your body began to age at a much slower rate. Now for every five years that elapse you age but one year.</p>
    <p>At this time many changes were occurring beyond the borders of Sommerlund. In the regions to the northeast of Magador and the Maakengorge, the Elder Magi of Dessi and the Herbwardens of Bautar were working together in an effort to restore the dusty volcanic wasteland to its former fertile state. It was the first tentative step towards the reclamation of all the Darklands. However, their progress was painfully slow, and both parties were resigned to the fact that their efforts to undo the damage caused by the Darklords would take not years but centuries to complete.</p>
    <p>In the far west, the Drakkarim had retreated to their homelands and were engaged in a bloody war against the Lencians. Much of southern Nyras<footref id="tssf-1" idref="tssf-1-foot"/> had been reclaimed by the armies of King Sarnac, the Lencian commander, and his flag now flew over territory which, two thousand years ago, had once been part of Lencia.</p>
    <p>Following the destruction of the Darklords of Helgedad, the Giaks, the most prolific in number of all of Gnaag<ch.apos/>s troops, fled into the Darklands and sought refuge in the gigantic city-fortresses of Nadgazad, Aarnak, Gournen, Akagazad, and Kaag. Within each of these hellish strongholds fierce fighting broke out as remnants of the Xaghash (lesser Darklords) and the Nadziranim (evil practitioners of Right-handed magic who once aided individual Darklord masters) fought for control. It is widely believed that by the time the Elder Magi and the Herbwardens reach the walls of these strongholds they will encounter no resistance; the occupants will have long since brought about their own extinction.</p>
    <p>Elsewhere, throughout Northern Magnamund, peace reigns victorious and the peoples of the Free Kingdoms rejoice in the knowledge that the age of the Darklords has finally come to an end. Readily men have exchanged their swords for hoes and their shields for ploughs, and now the only marching they do is along the ruts of their freshly furrowed fields. Few are the watchful eyes that scan the distant horizon in fear of what may appear, although there are still those who maintain their vigilance, for the agents of Naar come in many guises and there are those upon Magnamund who wait quietly in the shadows for the chance to do his evil bidding.</p>
    <p>Only a year ago the evil Cener Druids of Ruel attempted to enact Naar<ch.apos/>s revenge. Secretly, in the laboratories of their foul stronghold of Mogaruith, they had laboured to create a virulent plague virus capable of killing every living creature upon Magnamund, save their own kind. Word of their terrible plan reached Lord Rimoah who immediately urged the rulers of the Freelands to raise armies and invade Ruel. Hurriedly they complied, but the invasion ended in disaster. Seven thousand fighting men entered Ruel intent on storming the fortress of Mogaruith and razing it to the ground. Seven thousand marched into the dark realm; only seventy emerged alive. The Ceners were within days of perfecting their ultimate weapon when you took up the challenge and ventured alone into Mogaruith.</p>
    <p>Despite overwhelming odds you thwarted their evil plan by destroying the virus and the means by which it was created.</p>
    <p>After emerging from Ruel triumphant, your quest fulfilled, you returned home to Sommerlund and the Kai Monastery where you resumed your duties as Grand Master. Three months later, on the day that saw the first fall of winter snow, you were visited by Lord Rimoah. Once again he found himself the reluctant bearer of ill news. Your friend Guildmaster Banedon, whilst helping with the reclamation of wastelands close to the Maakengorge, had been abducted by a war-band of Giaks under the command of Nadziranim sorcerers. A rescue was attempted, but ruthlessly the Nadziranim obliterated those who tried to follow their escape into the Darklands. It was feared that the Nadziranim would try to extract from Banedon the secrets of Left-handed magic, so that they might marry it to their own foul sorcery. Such an outcome would have given them extraordinary power, power enough to revive the Darklands. A previous attempt to unite the two paths of magic had resulted in catastrophe for Sommerlund. In the year MS<ch.nbsp/>5050, Vonotar the Traitor, a magician from the same guild as Banedon, had betrayed his homeland in exchange for the promise of Nadziranim power. It was his act of treachery which brought about the invasion of Sommerlund and the destruction of the First Order of the Kai.</p>
    <p>Banedon<ch.apos/>s survival depended upon a swift rescue from Kaag. Mindful of all that was at stake, courageously you volunteered to enter the city-fortress alone in an attempt to save your friend.</p>
    <p>Despite fierce odds you gained entry to Kaag, located Banedon, and then snatched him from the foul denizens of that city by way of a daring aerial escape from the upper levels of their great citadel. Banedon was severely weakened by his ordeal at the hands of the Nadziranim and, had it not been for your timely intervention, he would certainly have perished in that grim city-fortress.</p>
    <p>The rescue of Guildmaster Banedon and his safe return to Sommerlund was cause for much celebration, especially in the streets and guildhalls of his native city of Toran. For several days you allowed yourself to be f<ch.ecirc/>ted by the Brotherhood of the Crystal Star before returning to your monastery where, with a feeling of quiet satisfaction, you gladly resumed your duties as Kai Grand Master.</p>
    <p>So the year ended and another began, yet even before the snows of winter had begun to thaw, once again your unique skills were being sought in the relentless struggle against Evil. This time the plea for help arrived by way of a foreign ambassador, a special envoy who had travelled thousands of miles from the court of  King Sarnac of Lencia. Their war against the Drakkarim,  who were under the command of Magnaarn, the High Warlord of Darke, had stagnated ever since the onset of winter and recently the whole campaign had taken a turn for the worse. The Lencians learned that Magnaarn had undertaken a quest for the Doomstone of Darke, an artefact of  legendary evil. It was said that this gem was the most powerful of all the Doomstones created by Agarash the Damned during the Age of Eternal Night. Before the demise of the Darklords, this Doomstone had rested in the head of the Nyras Sceptre, a magical weapon wielded by Darklord Dakushna, Lord of Kagorst. In the chaos that followed the wake of Dakushna<ch.apos/>s destruction, the Nyras Sceptre was lost, though many secretly believed it to have been stolen by one of Dakushna<ch.apos/>s Nadziranim sorcerers. Some months later during the war in Nyras the sceptre reappeared, but the Doomstone was missing from its setting atop the sceptre<ch.apos/>s platinum haft.</p>
    <p><quote>We fear that Magnaarn is close to finding the Doomstone of Darke,</quote> said the Lencian envoy. <quote>Already he possesses the sceptre<ch.apos/>s haft. My liege, King Sarnac, beseeches you, Grand Master Lone Wolf, to come to our aid. Help us find the Doomstone and thwart Magnaarn<ch.apos/>s plan, for if he successfully reunites the Doomstone and the Nyras sceptre he will command a power capable of our undoing.</quote></p>
    <p><quote>With respect, my lord, surely this one weapon, however evil it may be, is no match when pitted against all the armoured might of Lencia?</quote> you replied diplomatically, as yet unconvinced by the envoy<ch.apos/>s plea.</p>
    <p><quote>Perhaps so, Grand Master,</quote> he replied, <quote>were the nature of the threat merely the weapon alone. Sadly this is not the only issue here. Until now, the Nadziranim sorcerers who control the strongholds of Kagorst and Akagazad have refused to aid Magnaarn in his war against us. Many times he has begged them for help, for within those fortress walls are thousands of Giaks and other breeds who sought sanctuary there after the defeat of the Darklords. They still possess their weapons and they would make a formidable enemy if ever they were mustered against us. Magnaarn<ch.apos/>s possession of the Doomstone of Darke will most certainly influence the Nadziranim. Its power is such that Magnaarn could simply force them to obey  his every command. Their refusal would result in their immediate destruction.</quote></p>
    <p>Politely you dismissed the envoy whilst you considered your response to his plea. In the solitude of your chamber you pondered the problem, weighing the plight of Lencia against your duties and responsibilities there at the Kai Monastery. At length, after careful deliberation, you reached your decision.</p>
    <p><quote>Well my lord?</quote> enquired the envoy, nervously, upon re-entering your chamber. <quote>Will you help us thwart Magnaarn?</quote></p>
    <p><quote>Once, not so very long ago, your King and his army aided me during my quest for the Magnakai,</quote> you replied. <quote>Perhaps now the time has come for me to repay my debt of gratitude. Yes, I shall help you. I shall return with you to Lencia and champion your cause. I vow that I shall do all in my power to thwart Magnaarn<ch.apos/>s quest.</quote></p>

    <footnote id="gamerulz-2-foot" idref="gamerulz-2">
     <p>If you have completed any previous <cite>Lone Wolf Grand Master</cite> adventures, remember to choose an additional Grand Master Discipline and add +1 to your basic <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> and +2 to your basic <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> for each adventure you successfully completed (cf. <a idref="discplnz">Grand Master Disciplines</a>).</p>

   <data>

    <p>You keep a record of your adventure on the <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
    <p>For more than five years, ever since the demise of the Darklords of Helgedad, you have devoted yourself to developing further your fighting prowess<ch.emdash/><typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ><ch.emdash/>and physical stamina<ch.emdash/><typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ>. Before you begin this Grand Master adventure you need to measure how effective your training has been. To do this take a pencil and, with your eyes closed, point with the blunt end of it onto the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a>. If you pick a 0 it counts as zero.</p>
    <p>The first number that you pick from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> in this way represents your <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ>. Add 25 to the number you picked and write the total in the <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> section of your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a> (i.e. if your pencil fell on the number 6 in the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> you would write in a <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> of 31). When you fight, your <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> will be pitted against that of your enemy. A high score in this section is therefore very desirable.</p>
    <p>The second number that you pick from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> represents your powers of <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ>. Add 30 to this number and write the total in the <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> section of your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a> (i.e. if your pencil fell on the number 7 on the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> you would have 37 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points).</p>
    <p>If you are wounded in combat you will lose <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points. If at any time your <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points fall to zero or below, you are dead and the adventure is over. Lost <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points can be regained during the course of the adventure, but your number of <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points can never rise above the number you have when you start an adventure.</p>
    <p>If you have successfully completed any of the previous adventures in the <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> series (Books 1<ch.endash/>14), you can carry your current scores of <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> and <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points over to Book 15. These scores may include Weaponmastery, Curing, and Psi-surge bonuses obtained upon completion of <cite>Lone Wolf Kai</cite> (Books 1<ch.endash/>5) or <cite>Magnakai</cite> (Books 6<ch.endash/>12) adventures.<footref id="gamerulz-1" idref="gamerulz-1-foot"/> Only if you have completed these previous adventures will you benefit from the appropriate bonuses in the course of the <cite>Lone Wolf Grand Master</cite> series.<footref id="gamerulz-2" idref="gamerulz-2-foot"/> You may also carry over any Weapons and Backpack Items you had in your possession at the end of your last adventure, and these should be entered on your new Grand Master <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>. (You are still limited to two Weapons, but you may now carry up to ten Backpack Items.)</p>
    <p>However, only the following Special Items may be carried over from the <cite>Lone Wolf Kai</cite> (Books 1<ch.endash/>5) and <cite>Magnakai</cite> (Books 6<ch.endash/>12) series to the <cite>Lone Wolf Grand Master</cite> series (Books 13-onwards):</p>

       <p>If you have completed previous adventures, already possess the Magnakai Discipline of Weaponmastery with Bow, and have reached the rank of <bookref book="12tmod" section="imprvdsc">Mentora</bookref>, it seems that you should already be able to add 5 to numbers picked from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> (i.e. the basic Weaponmastery with Bow bonus of 3 added to the Mentora bonus of 2 for all missile weapons). Likely, the author intended the Weaponmastery bonus at the Mentora rank to be a <quote>hidden loyalty bonus</quote> (cf. <a href="http://www.projectaon.org/en/ReadersHandbook/NewsletterExcerpts#lwcn28">Lone Wolf Club Newsletter 28</a>). In view of this, the +2 Mentora bonus is therefore <em>not</em> cumulative with Grand Weaponmastery with Bow.</p>
       <p>Certain sections direct the reader to use different bonuses when using a Bow, ranging from 3 to 5, if you have Grand Weaponmastery with Bow. This may be the author adjusting the Grand Weaponmastery bonus on a case-by-case basis (and therefore this bonus should be used instead of the standard bonus) or an error (and therefore all of these bonuses should be 5). It is up to you to decide, but it seems most reasonable to follow the first alternative, to replace the Grand Weaponmastery bonus with whatever bonus is mentioned in that section.</p>

      <p>Now, through the pursuit of your new skills and the further development of your innate Kai abilities, you have set out upon a path of discovery that no other Kai Grand Master has ever attempted with success. Your determination to become the first Kai Supreme Master, by acquiring total proficiency in all twelve of the Grand Master Disciplines, is an awe-inspiring challenge. You will be venturing into the unknown, pushing back the boundaries of human limitation in the pursuit of greatness and the cause of Good. May the blessings of the Gods Kai and Ishir go with you as you begin your brave and noble quest.</p>
      <p>In the years following the demise of the Darklords you have reached the rank of Kai Grand Defender, which means that you have mastered <em>four</em> of the Grand Master Disciplines listed below. It is up to you to choose which four Disciplines these are. As all of the Grand Master Disciplines may be of use to you at some point during your adventure, pick your four skills with care. The correct use of a Grand Master Discipline at the right time could save your life.</p>
      <p>When you have chosen your four Disciplines, enter them in the Grand Master Disciplines section of your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>.</p>

        <p>This Discipline enables a Grand Master to become supremely efficient in the use of all weapons. When you enter combat with one of your Grand Weaponmastery weapons, you add 5 points to your <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ>. The rank of Kai Grand Defender, with which you begin the <cite>Lone Wolf Grand Master</cite> series, means you are supremely efficient in the use of <em>two</em> of the weapons listed below. For each book that you complete in the <cite>Lone Wolf Grand Master</cite> series (Books 13<ch.endash/>20), you will gain mastery of an additional weapon. For example, if you complete <cite>The Plague Lords of Ruel</cite> and have the Grand Master Discipline of Grand Weaponmastery at the beginning of the next <cite>Lone Wolf Grand Master</cite> book, you may choose an additional Weapon to gain mastery of.</p>

      <p>There will be occasions during your adventure when you have to fight an enemy. The enemy<ch.apos/>s <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> and <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points are given in the text. Lone Wolf<ch.apos/>s aim in the combat is to kill the enemy by reducing his <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points to zero while losing as few <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points as possible himself.</p>
      <p>At the start of a combat, enter Lone Wolf<ch.apos/>s and the enemy<ch.apos/>s <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points in the appropriate boxes on the Combat Record section of your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>. The sequence for combat is as follows:</p>
      <ol class="paragraphed">
       <li><p>Add any extra points gained through your Grand Master Disciplines and Special Items to your current <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> total.</p></li>
       <li>
        <p>Subtract the <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> of your enemy from this total. The result is your Combat Ratio. Enter it on the <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
        <p>Example</p>
        <p>Lone Wolf (<typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> 27) is attacked by a pack of Doomwolves (<typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> 30). He is taken by surprise and is not given the opportunity of evading their attack. Lone Wolf has the Grand Master Discipline of Kai-surge to which the Doomwolves are not immune, so Lone Wolf adds 8 points to his <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ>, giving him a total <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> of 35.</p>
        <p>He subtracts the Doomwolf pack<ch.apos/>s <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> from his own, giving a Combat Ratio of +5. (35<ch.minus/>30 = +5). +5 is noted on the <a idref="action">Action Chart</a> as the Combat Ratio.</p>
       </li>
       <li><p><a id="stage3">When you have your Combat Ratio</a>, pick a number from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a>.</p></li>
       <li>
        <p>Turn to the <a idref="crtable">Combat Results Table</a>. Along the top of the chart are shown the Combat Ratio numbers. Find the number that is the same as your Combat Ratio and cross-reference it with the random number that you have picked (the random numbers appear on the side of the chart). You now have the number of <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points lost by both Lone Wolf and his enemy in this round of combat. (E represents points lost by the enemy; LW represents points lost by Lone Wolf.)</p>
        <p>Example</p>
        <p>The Combat Ratio between Lone Wolf and the Doomwolf Pack has been established as +5. If the number picked from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> is a 2, then the result of the first round of combat is:</p>
        <ul>
         <li>Lone Wolf loses 3 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points (plus an additional 1 point for using Kai-surge).</li>
         <li>Doomwolf Pack loses 7 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points.</li>
        </ul>
       </li>
       <li><p>On the <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>, mark the changes in <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points to the participants in the combat.</p></li>
       <li><p>Unless otherwise instructed, or unless you have an option to evade, the next round of combat now starts.</p></li>
       <li><p>Repeat the sequence from <a idref="stage3">Stage 3</a>.</p></li>
      </ol>

      <p>This process of combat continues until <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points of either the enemy or Lone Wolf are reduced to zero or below, at which point that combatant is declared dead. If Lone Wolf is dead, the adventure is over. If the enemy is dead, Lone Wolf proceeds but with his <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points possibly reduced.</p>

        <p>During your adventure you may be given the chance to evade combat. If you have already engaged in a round of combat and decide to evade, calculate the combat for that round in the usual manner. All points lost by the enemy as a result of that round are ignored, and you make your escape. Only Lone Wolf may lose <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points during that round (but then that is the risk of running away!). You may evade only if the text of the particular section allows you to do so.</p>

        <p>If you are a Grand Master who has reached the rank of Kai Grand Guardian (5 Disciplines), you will now benefit from improvements to the following Grand Master Disciplines:</p>
        <dl class="paragraphed">
         <dt>Animal Mastery</dt>
          <dd><p>Kai Grand Guardians with this Discipline are able to  summon a limited number of forest animals to their location. The creatures so summoned will become loyal and willing allies, willing to do the Kai Grand Guardian<ch.apos/>s bidding. This ability can only be used in an outdoor setting.</p></dd>
         <dt>Assimilance</dt>
          <dd><p>Kai Grand Guardians who possess this skill are able to create a cloud of fog-like vapour within 15 yards of their location. This fog will obscure both normal and infravision. The duration of the fog increases as a Grand Master rises in rank.</p></dd>
         <dt>Grand Huntmastery</dt>
          <dd><p>Kai Grand Guardians with this skill enjoy increased mobility when travelling across all types of terrain, whether on foot or on horseback. This improved ability is very useful when used to outdistance a pursuing enemy.</p></dd>
         <dt>Kai-surge</dt>
          <dd><p>Kai Grand Guardians who possess mastery of this Discipline are able to attack up to three enemies in psychic combat simultaneously.</p></dd>
         <dt>Kai-screen</dt>
          <dd><p>Kai Grand Guardians who possess this Discipline are able to exercise a defensive psychic skill known as Mindblend. This cloaking ability enables them to both protect and hide their minds from being detected by a hostile psychic probe.</p></dd>
         <dt>Magi-magic</dt>
          <dd>
           <p>Grand Masters who have reached the rank of Kai Grand Guardian are able to use the following battle-spells of the Elder Magi:</p>
           <ul>
            <li><spell>Splinter</spell><ch.emdash/>This causes breakable items such as bottles, jugs, mirrors, windows, etc., to shatter to pieces. The range of this spell increases as a Grand Master rises in rank.</li>
            <li><spell>Flameshaft</spell><ch.emdash/>This causes the tip of any arrow, or arrow-like missile, to burn fiercely with a magical flame which cannot readily be extinguished by normal means.</li>

        <dl class="paragraphed">
         <dt>Grand Weaponmastery</dt>
          <dd><p>Sun Knights with this Discipline are able to wield two-handed weapons (i.e. Broadsword, Quarterstaff, and Spear) with full effect, using only one hand.</p></dd>
         <dt>Deliverance</dt>
          <dd><p>Sun Knights who possess this skill are able to repair serious wounds sustained by creatures other than themselves. By the laying of hands upon the affected creature<ch.apos/>s body, a Sun Knight can cause an open wound (or other serious injury) to mend itself. The speed at which this healing takes place increases as a Grand Master rises in rank.</p></dd>
         <dt>Grand Pathsmanship</dt>
          <dd><p>Kai Sun Knights with this skill are able to repel at will all normal-sized insects within a radius of three yards. The range and number of insects so affected increase considerably as a Grand Master rises in rank.</p></dd>
         <dt>Grand Nexus</dt>
          <dd><p>Sun Knights who possess Mastery of this Discipline are able to feign death. By placing themselves into a state of suspended animation, outwardly they are able to achieve all semblance of being truly dead. However, whilst in this state the only sense that a Sun Knight retains is the ability to hear.</p></dd>
         <dt>Telegnosis</dt>
          <dd><p>Sun Knights who possess this Discipline are able to communicate telepathically over great distances. Initially the range of this ability is approximately 100 miles, but this distance increases as a Grand Master rises in rank.</p></dd>
         <dt>Kai-alchemy</dt>
          <dd>
           <p>Grand Masters who have reached the rank of Sun Knight are able to use the following Brotherhood Spells:</p>
           <ul>
            <li><spell>Halt Missile</spell><ch.emdash/>This causes any projected or hurled missile (e.g. arrows, axes, crossbow bolts) which may pose an immediate threat to the life of a Sun Knight, to cease its flight and remain stationary in mid-air. The effect of the spell lasts for 2<ch.endash/>3 seconds, allowing the Sun Knight sufficient time to move away from its line of flight. Initially only one missile can be affected by this spell, but the number increases as a Grand Master rises in rank.</li>
            <li><spell>Strength</spell><ch.emdash/>By casting this spell, a Sun Knight is able to greatly increase his or her physical strength for a short duration. It can be used to lift or move heavy objects, or to effect a temporary increase in <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> and <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> scores whilst fighting an enemy.</li>
           </ul>

    <p>Your mission to thwart Magnaarn<ch.apos/>s quest for the Doomstone of Darke will be fraught with deadly dangers. Be wary and on your guard at all times, for the warriors of Nyras are still a formidable enemy despite their recent defeats on the battlefields of the Western Tentarias.</p>
    <p>Some of the things that you will find during your mission will be of use to you in this and future <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> books, while others may be red herrings of no real value at all. If you discover items, be selective in what you choose to keep.</p>
    <p>Pick your Grand Master Disciplines with care, for a wise choice will enable any player to complete the quest, no matter how weak their initial <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> and <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> scores may be. Successful completion of previous <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> adventures, although an advantage, is not essential for the completion of this Grand Master adventure.</p>
    <p>The lives of thousands of Lencian crusaders besieging the city of Darke and, ultimately, the final outcome of their war against the hated Drakkarim depends on the success of your mission. May the light of Kai and Ishir be your guide as you venture into the Helotry of Nyras.</p>

      <p>Having pledged your help, you commence preparations for your long journey to Lencia. You have many things you wish to attend to before you depart and so you invite Lord Floras, the Lencian envoy, to enjoy the hospitality of the monastery for a few days in order that you can settle your most pressing obligations. To your surprise he declines your invitation and insists that you leave at once, for he is anxious to return immediately to his distant homeland. Respectfully he reminds you that time does not favour your quest. By ship and by horse his journey to the monastery took more than a month to complete, and with Magnaarn already so near to finding the Doomstone of Darke, he fears that further delays could prove disastrous.</p>

      <p>Mindful of the great distance which needs to be traversed you hurriedly dispatch a journeyman to Toran. He carries your request for help which is addressed to Lord Rimoah, your most trusted friend and advisor, who is presently attending to Guildmaster Banedon in his convalescence. Early next morning Lord Rimoah arrives at the monastery in person, aboard the vessel that is to be the answer to your dilemma: <cite>Skyrider</cite><ch.emdash/>Banedon<ch.apos/>s flying ship.</p>
      <p>Warmly you greet your old friend, and then you introduce him formally to Lord Floras. The two talk at length about the war in the west, and Rimoah concludes the discussion by voicing his approval of your decision to go to King Sarnac<ch.apos/>s aid. Then he offers some words of warning.</p>
      <p><quote>Be in no doubt, Grand Master,</quote> he says, <quote>this mission you have chosen to fulfil will be as perilous as any you have undertaken in the past. Magnaarn is a cunning adversary and this stone he seeks is possessed of a deadly evil. Do not underestimate your enemy. If he should succeed in his quest then I fear the lands of the Western Tentarias will never be at peace.</quote></p>

      <p>As you search the smouldering ruins, you discover little has survived the fire which, at its height, must have transformed this town into a blazing inferno. The charred bones and skulls of those who died in the battle are strewn everywhere, and no attempt has been made to bury them. You are examining the remains of a Drakkarim sword when suddenly you hear Schera calling you. His voice is full of urgency. You discard the sword and hurry back to the main street to find out what is wrong.</p>

      <p>Keen to maintain the element of surprise, you quickly leave the trench and rush across the remaining strip of open ground which separates you from the town<ch.apos/>s outlying dwellings.

      <p>There is a dull <onomatopoeia>click</onomatopoeia> and the great iron door swings slowly to reveal a dark chamber constructed entirely of polished black rock.<footref id="sect5-1" idref="sect5-1-foot"/> Revealed in the torchlight is a throne of rough-hewn marble, upon which there rests the skeletal remains of a warrior clad in mouldering furs. Bare bone gleams dully through a clinging mass of muscle and sinew, now shrunken to an iron-hard texture, and upon its skull there rests a helm of solid gold. Set into the face of this helm is an emerald as large as your fist.</p>

      <p>Prarg approaches the throne, tempted by the magnificent emerald, but he halts the moment you warn him that the helm is protected by a magical trap. You sense that a powerful spell of warding encircles the throne; to touch the crown would activate the spell, thereby unleashing a blast of destructive energy. The thought of being blown to atoms serves to dampen Prarg<ch.apos/>s curiosity and sheepishly he returns to your side. You give the booby-trapped throne a wide berth and leave the chamber by a smooth-walled tunnel in the far wall. But you have taken no more than a dozen steps when a chill of premonition runs like a trickle of icy cold water down your spine. You halt and reach for your weapon.</p>
      <p>Then a loud voice booms out, destroying the silence.</p>
      <p><quote>Welcome, Lone Wolf. Welcome to your tomb!</quote></p>
      <p>Instinctively you know that it is the voice of Warlord Magnaarn.</p>

You count fifty steps before you eventually arrive at a chamber which is heaped with rubble. Its only door is blocked by debris and huge slabs of marble, making an immediate exit impossible. But it is not the door which commands your attention; it is a narrow circular shaft which is set into the middle of the ceiling. It is the source of the cold, wintry draught.</p>

You focus upon the darkness and suddenly you see that the noise comes from nests of winged insects which are fixed all along the inside of the shaft.</p>

      <p>As the deadly crossbow bolts scream towards you and the captain, you open your hand and thrust your palm into Prarg<ch.apos/>s back, pushing him forward. This swift action saves him from the first bolt, but it robs you of time in which to react to the second. It strikes and red-hot pain flares up your arm as the iron-tipped bolt gouges a deep furrow of flesh from the back of your wrist: lose 4 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points.</p>
      <p>The lookouts fumble with their crossbows, desperate to fire again but before they can reload you have disappeared along the beach. Shortly you reach a small secluded cove where Prarg discovers a rusty anchor. It is a landmark, left on purpose by agents of King Sarnac to point the way to the cave where they have left your boat and provisions. You find the cave and together you haul the boat down the beach and raise its coal-black sail before pushing it out into the icy waters of the Tentarias.</p>
      <p>Once aboard you trim the sail whilst Prarg takes charge of the rudder. There is a good wind and within minutes your tiny craft is bobbing towards the far western channel of the Hellswamp, twenty miles distant. You ask Prarg if this dark estuary has a name, and he replies, <quote>Yes. The Drakkarim call it <quote>Dakushna<ch.apos/>s Channel</quote> after the Darklord who once commanded the city-fortress of Kagorst. They say it is a fitting dedication, for the waterway is as deadly and as treacherous as the creature after whom it is named.</quote></p>

      <p>During your trek through the forest, Prarg tells you a little about the history of this land. You learn that the whole of Nyras was once known as Northern Lencia until it was lost to the invading Drakkarim during the Darkdawn War. Many crusades and campaigns have been launched over the centuries to try to recapture this territory, but none, until now, have been successful. The Drakkarim built a fortress on the ruins of the Lencian capital, which was called Gamir, which they renamed Nagamir after their victory. But later, when the Drakkarim allied themselves to the Darklords of Helgedad, the capital was renamed Darke in their honour.</p>
      <p>As dusk approaches, you happen by chance upon a forest trail and immediately your tracking skills tell you that it has only recently been constructed. Hoof prints frozen beneath the snow and several sets of footprints tell you that this trail has been used by more than a dozen riders and armoured foot soldiers within the last week.</p>

      <p>Schera wakes you shortly before dawn and wearily you rise from your makeshift bed. Mindful of the journey ahead, you make a brief search of the armoury and discover a few weapons, and other items which could prove useful:</p>

      <p>The captain sends word to his men to find boats for the voyage downstream. The order is duly carried out and, within the hour, twenty small craft have been brought to the icy river on the west side of the stone bridge. Schera appoints ten men to each craft; then you and he step aboard the first boat, cast off, and begin a voyage that will take you towards the coastal city of Darke.</p>
      <p>The current is strong and the river is free of obstructions, enabling your flotilla to make swift progress downstream. Much of the river bank is lightly wooded and Schera commands everyone to remain vigilant in case there are Drakkarim among the trees, lying in ambush. You pass through the woods without incident, and shortly before noon, you see the ruined town of Odnenga in the distance. Every building has been razed to the ground and a pall of wood smoke hangs above the town, fed by fires still smouldering from a battle that took place here several days ago. The river here is blocked by debris and you are forced to put ashore. Schera<ch.apos/>s men set to work clearing a passage, while you and the captain scout the ruins in search of information.</p>

      <p>As you land your killing blow, the Mawtaw shrieks an unearthly cry and falls to the ground, shivering and twitching fitfully. Then, with unnerving abruptness, it stiffens and lies still. Prarg immediately awakens from his hypnotic trance and, to your surprise, you discover that he has no memory at all of what has happened in the last hour.</p>
      <p>Quickly you hurry away from the carcass of the slain Mawtaw and press on deeper into the forest. Your instinct and Pathsmanship skills lead you in a northerly direction and you cover more than five miles before the trees begin to thin out. Then you emerge from the forest to be greeted by a spectacular sight.</p>

      <p>You are ushered into a lavish chamber that is hung with Lencian flags and decorated with exotic fineries from the far-flung corners of Magnamund. All around guardsmen stand rigidly to attention, their eyes watchful and unblinking behind their silver visors as you approach the high-backed throne which dominates the centre of the room. There before you sits King Sarnac, his silver-grey hair framing a benign face that is still lean and firm despite advancing years.</p>
      <p><quote>Welcome, Grand Master,</quote> he says, as he rises from his throne and offers his hand in friendship. <quote>I prayed that you would come to Lencia, to help in the defeat of that cur, Magnaarn, but I did not imagine that you would arrive so soon. You are most welcome.</quote></p>
      <p>Gladly you acknowledge the King<ch.apos/>s greeting and, after he has commended and dismissed Lord Floras, you adjourn with him to an antechamber where he tells you about the mission ahead.</p>
      <p><quote>Latest reports from my spies and scouts in the north say that Magnaarn is presently at his army headquarters in Shugkona. Drakkarim have been seen combing a region of the Tozaz Forest fifty miles to the north of his headquarters. We think that this is where he believes he<ch.apos/>ll find the Doomstone of Darke. There are many ancient temples in this area<ch.ellips/>perhaps one is harbouring that evil gem.</quote></p>

      <p>The King pauses for a few moments to take some refreshment. From a jewel-encrusted pitcher, he pours two glasses of wine and proffers one to you before continuing. Gratefully you accept and politely you sip the rare vintage whilst listening to the King<ch.apos/>s plan of action.</p>
      <p><quote>Grand Master,</quote> he says, fixing you with his powerful gaze, <quote>if you are to thwart Magnaarn you must travel to Shugkona and seek him out. He must be killed, or failing this, the infernal Doomstone must be destroyed before he can use it against us. Secrecy is paramount if your mission is to succeed; therefore no attempt to approach Shugkona directly can be made. The lines of battle are drawn up to within fifty miles of that stronghold and the region is alive with Drakkarim. Yet there is still one means of approach that the enemy will not be guarding. I have made provision for a boat to take you to a place we call <quote>Bear Rock</quote>. It lies on the River Gourneni and is only thirty miles from Magnaarn<ch.apos/>s headquarters. However, there is one complication<ch.ellips/>to reach the river you must first enter the Hellswamp.</quote></p>
      <p>The thought of venturing into that terrible mire fills you with a cold dread, for the Hellswamp is notoriously perilous. King Sarnac recognizes your apprehension and quickly he tries to assuage your fears.</p>
      <p><quote>I understand your anxiety, Grand Master, but rest assured that you will not be entering alone. One of my finest officers will be your guide throughout this mission. He has scouted this route before and he knows how to avoid its many dangers. Once you reach Bear Rock he will guide you through the forest to Shugkona. There you must find out where Magnaarn is and do whatever is necessary to foil his quest. Once your mission has been accomplished, my officer will bring you through our battle lines and see you safely back here to Vadera.</quote></p>
      <p>The king reaches for a cord which hangs from a hole in the domed ceiling. He tugs it and a bell tinkles in a distant part of the citadel.</p>
      <p><quote>Now, Grand Master,</quote> he says, turning to face the door of the antechamber, <quote>the time has come for me to introduce your guide.</quote></p>

Silently the lock disengages and the door swings open to reveal two Tukodak guards, both standing with their backs to you.

      <p>You follow Prarg to the top of the steps, and as you race along the body-strewn battlements, you see the fighting which is raging both inside and outside the city. The battlements end at a tower where a flight of spiral steps ascend to a circular landing. Here you wait in the shadows until a troop of Drakkarim pass by. While you are waiting for them to disappear, you look out of the tower through an arrow slit and see the waters of the Gulf of Lencia, and the conflict that is raging across the coastal plain.</p>

      <p>A shudder runs down your spine as, for the first time since you entered Darke, you feel the presence of the Doomstone. Fear returns to haunt you, the fear that the evil gem will sap your strength, as it did when first you encountered it at the Temple of Antah. If this is still so then Magnaarn may prove impossible to defeat.</p>
      <p>Prarg senses your anxiety and he offers some words of advice and hope: <quote>The taking of Darke has weakened the Warlord<ch.emdash/>he<ch.apos/>s paid a terrible price. He has been forced to retire from the battle in order to recover his strength and he is presently at his weakest. Now, Sire, is the time to strike.</quote></p>
      <p>Beyond the landing lies a corridor which leads to a junction where another passageway crosses from left to right. You look to the right and see that the way is blocked by a heavy steel door. Prarg utters a curse under his breath, and then he explains his anger.</p>
      <p><quote>That way leads directly to the Palace Tower. Magnaarn is hiding there, in its uppermost chamber.</quote></p>

      <p>The fight for control of Konozod is swift and bloody. Within the hour the town is under Lencian control, its Drakkarim garrison having been put mercilessly to the sword. However, not all of the enemy perish in the battle. To Captain Schera<ch.apos/>s dismay, several manage to escape across the river and flee to the west on horseback. He is anxious that they may return with reinforcements to retake the town.</p>
      <p>A food store is discovered and, whilst the starving Lencians satiate their hunger, you talk with Captain Schera about the events of the last few weeks which have led to this meeting. Your learn from him that after you were interred in the Temple of Antah, Warlord Magnaarn waged a major offensive against the Lencian army. Having reunited the Doomstone with the Nyras Sceptre, he has, as King Sarnac feared, forced the Nadziranim sorcerers of Kagorst and Akagazad to help him. Their combined skills have wrought great destruction. They attacked and drove through the Lencian lines like demons in an offensive which was swift and deadly. A week ago, Captain Schera and his regiment were cut off and captured in the fighting around Hokidat, after which they were marched here and imprisoned. He considers himself lucky to be alive, for the Drakkarim rarely take prisoners. Then you ask what news he has heard about the war since he came here.</p>
      <p><quote>There<ch.apos/>s much confusion,</quote> he says, wearily. <quote>I<ch.apos/>ve heard talk that most of the mercenaries in Sarnac<ch.apos/>s pay have deserted us. Some have even joined the enemy. The Drakkarim taunted us, saying that our army had been smashed. They said the remnants had been pushed into the Tentarias, but I dismissed this as lies. One thing is sure, though: Magnaarn intends to raise the siege of Darke. It has become his battle call<ch.emdash/><quote>On to Darke!</quote> This cry was on the lips of his troops during the battle at Hokidat. I saw him during this battle. He was leading his army personally, and he was wielding his accursed sceptre, dealing death to all who tried to stand in his way. He possesses a great and terrible power, and I fear that we may now be unable to put an end to his evil ambitions.</quote></p>

Within a few moments you are on your feet, your weapon in hand as you race up the bank towards the place where you stationed your timber wolf guards. As you crest the bank you see them pacing back and forth, their eyes fixed on the forest<ch.apos/>s edge, their thick white fur standing on end with anxiety and fear. You scour the tree-line and at once you see the cause of their concern: Akataz. A dozen of the leathery black war-dogs are slinking in the shadows, waiting for the chance to attack. These ferocious wild dogs are often used by the Drakkarim and you have encountered them before on several occasions. Mindful of past experiences, you recall a weakness of the breed: they are particularly susceptible to psychic attacks.</p>
      <p>Armed with this knowledge, you focus your Magnakai skill of Psi-surge upon the pack and launch a sharp blast of psychic energy in their direction. The effect is immediate: the Akataz are traumatized by this sudden assault. Shrieking with fright, the dogs flee from the bank and seek refuge in the dark safety of the Tozaz Forest.

      <p>A few moments after the wall closes there is a sound like distant thunder. Then a shudder runs through the floor and clumps of dirt begin to fall from cracks in the ceiling. Your strength is returning, but before you can attempt to escape, there is an almighty explosion and a deluge of rock and damp earth cascades into the passageway. The ceiling and floor are being pulled in opposing directions, and with a grating cry of tortured stone, the heavy portcullis shatters in two. Quickly you crawl beneath a broken section which lies at an angle to the wall, and take cover as countless tons of rock and earth rain down from above.</p>
      <p>When at last the destruction ceases you find yourself trapped in the narrow triangular space between the heavy portcullis and the wall. Your quick thinking has saved you from physical injury, but, as far as you can tell, you are now buried in a collapsed level of the temple, hundreds of feet below the surface. Confident in the knowledge that, at worst, your stamina and Kai skills alone can keep you alive for several days, you begin the slow and laborious task of digging your way out of this subterranean tomb.</p>

      <p>Guided by your intuition, you set off with Prarg along the forest trail heading west, and soon your tracking skills warn you that you are nearing an enemy encampment. You signal your discovery to Prarg, and he follows as stealthily you enter the undergrowth and slip past a line of Drakkarim sentries. From the cover of the dense forest bracken you observe their camp. You count more than two dozen soldiers, plus horses, wagons, and shelters. Prarg points to the emblem which adorns all of their uniforms and equipment: a black eagle clutching two fiery swords.</p>

      <p>You nod in agreement; then together you slip away from the camp and head north through the trees. You are drawn in this direction by something your senses have detected. It is a strong aura of energy, an evil energy which you feel sure must be radiating from the Doomstone of Darke. Within a few minutes you stumble upon a clearing where stands the majestic ruins of an ancient temple. At once you know that this is the Temple of Antah, and you sense that the Doomstone is here, lying somewhere deep within the ruins.</p>

      <p>You share your premonition of danger with Captain Prarg and wisely he heeds your warning. He suggests you draw in the sail to prevent the wind from propelling your boat towards the raft of weeds, yet once the sail is gathered, still you find yourselves drifting ever nearer to the obstruction.</p>
      <p>With weapons drawn, you wait in tense expectation as the boat grazes the edge of the weed-raft. For a few seconds there is an unnatural silence; then suddenly a gurgling screech rends the frosty air. Like sorcery-conjured demons, a dozen ghoulish creatures rise up from the murky depths of the swamp amid a seething froth of bubbles. Swiftly they climb from beneath the weed-raft and slink from other hiding places among the dank thickets of the adjoining bank. Within seconds they have you surrounded.</p>
      <p><quote>Ciquali!</quote> cries Prarg, naming these ghoulish foes. He steps forward, brandishing his sword, and lashes out at the boldest of the dome-headed creatures as it tries to slip aboard. His razor-sharp blade severs its forearm at the wrist, sending a scaly webbed hand spinning into the swamp, trailing green ichor. The beast screams as it falls over the side, yet no sooner has it vanished beneath the surface when two more of its kin grab the gunwales and attempt to haul themselves into the boat.</p>

      <p>A ragged line of Lencian prisoners are crossing the stone bridge, escorted by a dozen Drakkarim armed with crossbows and spears. The main gates swing open to admit them, and, as the Lencians file through with their heads bowed in defeat, you see that the central square of this town has been turned into a large prisoner-of-war compound. It is enclosed by a crude fence of wire and sharpened stakes, which is patrolled by sentries and Akataz war-dogs. From what little you can see you estimate at least two hundred Lencians are being held captive here.</p>
      <p>The conditions are shocking. The men are being kept out in the open, without shelter or heat of any kind, and judging by the state of those already here, it looks as if the Drakkarim are purposefully starving them to death.</p>
      <p>Your shock soon turns to anger, and you vow to do something to help these prisoners. But before you can think through a plan of action, your Kai senses warn you of approaching footsteps. Two of the Drakkarim escort have slipped away from the line and they are now walking briskly towards the alleyway. One has a large canvas sack slung over his shoulder, and as they draw closer, you are forced to take cover in a shadowy doorway to avoid being seen.</p>

      <p>The moment you feel the icy cold waters of the Gourneni lapping about your legs, you press your shoulders to the stern timbers and launch the boat into the shallows. Prarg scrambles over the side, and then turns with his arms outstretched to pull you aboard.</p>
      <p><quote>Quickly, Lone Wolf!</quote> he screams, <quote>they<ch.apos/>re nearly upon us!</quote></p>
      <p>With Prarg<ch.apos/>s help you clamber over the gunwale, narrowly avoiding the horns of a Gorodon as you tumble head-over-heels into the bottom of the boat. Unaided, the boat drifts towards the middle of the river and is soon beyond reach of the Gorodons who, despite their hunger, have decided not to pursue.</p>
      <p><quote>That was too close for comfort,</quote> says Prarg, as he struggles to free the oars and set them in place. <quote>We can count ourselves lucky to have escaped with our lives and limbs intact. The first time I navigated these channels I lost three good men in a Gorodon attack. These beasts are the bane of this accursed place<ch.ellips/>yet, <ch.apos/>tis true to say, there are other creatures here that are far worse. Far worse.</quote></p>
      <p>Using the oars you soon reach the west bank where, once safely ashore, you encamp on a strip of frozen loam that overlooks a bleak expanse of marsh. Night has fallen and so too has the temperature. From the shelter of your upturned boat you cast your experienced eye across the darkening skies and see banks of cloud, heavy with snow, scudding the distant horizon. They are an unwelcome sight, the precursors to a winter storm.</p>
      <p>Prarg volunteers to continue the first watch but, mindful that his need for rest is greater than yours, you insist that he gets some sleep. For four hours you sit and scan the bleak horizon, your mind filled with unanswered questions about the mission and the dangers you have yet to face. While you ponder what awaits you in the near future, you remain watchful and alert, your encounter on the east bank still vivid in your mind. Fortunately, the increasing cold dissuades the Hellswamp<ch.apos/>s inhabitants from leaving their lairs this night and your watch passes without incident.</p>
      <p>Then the time comes for you to awaken Prarg. With a noticeable lack of enthusiasm he takes his turn while you settle yourself down to catch a few hours of much needed sleep.</p>

Quickly you step over his corpse and hurry to the table to study the map. To your disappointment, the map turns out to be merely a construction plan of the encampment. It offers no clues to Magnaarn<ch.apos/>s present location.</p>

      <p>Prarg has reservations about your decision; he fears that your curiosity could be leading you both straight into the arms of the enemy. You understand his anxiety but you stand by your decision. Time is running against you and some risks must be taken if you are to discover quickly the location of Magnaarn and the Doomstone. With a nod of his head Prarg accepts the logic of your argument. Then, as if to reaffirm his loyalty, he draws his sword and offers to lead the way.</p>
      <p>Cautiously you follow him through the dense trees, your nerves as taught as bowstrings. As you draw closer, you are able to make out the sounds of wood being chopped, gruff voices, and the jingle of horse bridles. Your suspicions are confirmed when you reach the edge of a clearing and see a Drakkarim encampment in the centre of recently cleared ground. Three log cabins, two only partially completed, stand in the middle of a circular ditch which is backed in turn by a chest-high wall of sharpened stakes. You count more than a hundred Drakkarim labouring to complete this forest outpost, while another fifty or so stand guard along its perimeter wall. They look well-equipped; all are clad in thick furs and studded leather armour, and they wield weapons which are unmistakably fresh from the forge.</p>

      <p>Slowly you edge your way around the clearing until you are on the north side of the encampment. Here the perimeter wall has yet to be completed, affording you an unobstructed view of the cabins. You settle yourself behind a fallen tree and patiently you observe the main hut. Suddenly the door swings open, and a Drakkarim officer strides out into the snow. He pulls on his iron helm and draws his wolfskin cloak close about him as he goes off to inspect his men<ch.apos/>s work. The door swings shut, but before it closes, you catch a glimpse of something that sparks your curiosity anew.</p>

      <p>The moment you strike your killing blow, the creature explodes with a flash of brilliant white light. As the glare fades, you see that nothing whatsoever remains of either its body or spirit. Magnaarn witnesses the death of his servant with a look of pure terror. He screams, and in a moment of panic, he touches the head of the Nyras Sceptre to the floor. There is a tremendous boom, and the floor shudders violently as it is torn wide open by a massive quake.</p>
      <p>Hurriedly, Magnaarn makes his escape through a curtained archway. Determined not to allow him to escape, you get ready to leap across the fissure which has opened up the chamber floor. It is no less than twenty feet wide at its narrowest point.</p>

He reaches the door, throws it open, and disappears quickly inside. For a few moments there is complete silence; then he reappears, sheathes his bloodied blade, and beckons you to hurry to the tower.</p>

You do not have to wait too long, for within minutes of deciphering the crow<ch.apos/>s warning, you see the first few outriders of a Drakkarim platoon crest the horizon. You magnify your vision and recognize them to be part of Magnaarn<ch.apos/>s own army. They are carrying lances topped with pennants that bear Magnaarn<ch.apos/>s personal emblem: an eagle clasping two fiery swords. Steadily these cavalry scouts draw closer. They are riding directly towards the river.</p>

      <p>Upon reaching the base of the chasm you discover the ground to be slick with black, foul-smelling mud. It is peppered with broken slabs of rock, veined marble, and other temple debris which have fallen from the many sundered levels above. You wade through this ankle-deep slime, following the course of the river as it rushes towards the brick-lined tunnel at a frightful speed. When you reach the tunnel entrance, to your relief you discover a solid stone walkway which runs parallel to the roaring water. From the roof of this echoing tunnel hang vast, bloated domes of stinking fungi which give off a grey-green radiance. It is an unwelcoming light, an illumination born of decay.</p>
      <p>You have taken a few hundred paces along the stone walkway when you are confronted by a massive iron grill. It stretches across the entire width of the tunnel and prevents you from continuing further in this direction. Nearby, a heavy chain hangs from a hole in the arched ceiling. Upon closer investigation you discover that it operates a concealed winch which raises and lowers the grill, like the portcullis of a castle. You are about to haul the chain and raise the grill when suddenly you hear a beast-like roar echoing along the tunnel, louder than the rushing water. You sense danger; something is approaching. You release the chain and spin around, your hand reaching instinctively to your weapon, but you are frozen immobile by the terrible sight of the creature that is now moving along the walkway towards you.</p>

Now that it appears Magnaarn has found the Doomstone, you know you should do as Captain Prarg insisted; you should try to reach Antah and confront him before he can use his newfound power against the Lencians. But you are loath to abandon your guide. You have promised Prarg that you will help him escape, and a Kai Grand Master never breaks his word. The captain has been captured as a spy, and as such, he can expect no mercy from the Drakkarim.</p>

He points to a ship, one of several moored at the quayside, but one that is readily identifiable for it is the only vessel not in military service.</p>
      <p><quote>That trading sloop will carry you and the captain to the small island you can see in the distance. That is Battle Isle. There you will find a sailing boat with enough provisions for your mission. The captain knows where it is hidden and he will be responsible for your safe passage once you set sail for the Hellswamp. Remember, secrecy is vital to the success of your mission. Trust nobody save Captain Prarg.</quote></p>
      <p>The King voices his fear that Drakkarim spies are operating in the harbour and he expresses his concern that your unexpected arrival by air may have already alerted them to your presence here in Vadera. However, it is too late to change the plan; it is a risk you must accept.</p>
      <p>Having concluded your briefing, King Sarnac sends for an escort to take you to a private chamber where you can rest and reflect upon the mission ahead. Later that evening, you and Captain Prarg are smuggled out of the citadel via a secret passage which leads directly to the harbour. Quietly you board the sloop and hide yourselves amongst its cargo of supplies which are destined for the garrison on Battle Isle. The ship sets sail on the first strike of midnight and, after a smooth and uneventful voyage it moors at a jetty on the southern coast of Battle Isle, three hours later.</p>
      <p>The crew of the sloop are unaware that you are aboard and, in order to safeguard your secrecy, you await your chance to disembark without being seen. Soon the opportunity presents itself. As the crew go in search of help to unload the cargo, the two of you leave the sloop and hurry off along the beach, heading north towards the place where your sailing boat awaits. There is no cloud and a near-full moon illuminates the rocky beach, making it easy for you to progress despite the difficult terrain.</p>

Prarg volunteers to sit the first watch, and hungry for sleep, you bow to his request. But it seems as if you have only just closed your eyes when you are awoken by his hushed and fearful voice:</p>
      <p><quote>Awake Sire, I think we<ch.apos/>ve visitors!</quote></p>
      <p>You rise in an instant, your hand reaching in reflex for your weapons as your senses try to locate the threat. In the middle-distance, emerging from a bed of tall, frost-heavy rushes, you catch sight of three large and scaly reptilians. From horn-tipped snout to barbed tail they are twenty feet or more, and, despite their enormous weight, they move with impressive lizard-like grace.</p>
      <p><quote>Gorodons!</quote> says Prarg, his voice full of horror. <quote>Quickly, Sire, we must get away while we still can!</quote></p>
      <p>Hurriedly you right the boat and drag it through the cloying mud towards the river. Your escape is painfully slow and your mounting fear rapidly approaches sheer terror when, in unison, the pursuing Gorodons give vent to a chorus of croaking growls At once you sense that these huge carnivores are ravenously hungry, and the prospect of a feast upon warm-blooded prey is driving them into a frenzy.</p>

      <p>You watch with mounting anxiety as the Drakkarim officer approaches the execution block. He halts beside the helpless captain and signals to the gaolers to step back, to give him room to enact the execution. Then he takes an oiled stone from his pocket and an ugly sneer spreads across his face as he proceeds to sharpen the blade of the great axe with slow deliberation.</p>

      <p>The night passes without incident and you awake to a bright dawn feeling refreshed by your long, uninterrupted sleep. Prarg, too, has slept well, and he feels eager to start the journey to Shugkona. Fresh snow has fallen during the night, and when you descend to the base of the tree, you discover several sets of footprints nearby. Your Pathsmanship senses tell you that they are little more than an hour old and were made by a Drakkarim patrol heading due north.</p>
      <p>You set off towards the northeast, following a frozen stream that winds its way through the forest like a glistening crystal serpent. Luck and your Kai skills keep you safe from the Drakkarim patrols, and by noon you find yourselves approaching the outskirts of Shugkona. From the cover afforded by a small wooden footbridge that crosses the icy stream, you are able to reconnoitre this heavily fortified Drakkarim town. Log-lined trenches encircle most of its perimeter, fronted by pits filled with sharpened stakes to counter attacks by enemy cavalry. Mantlets and wheeled barricades defend its four highway approaches, and the whole line is manned by squads of Drakkarim and Hammerland mercenaries. However, this formidable protection comprises just a first line of defence behind which there are more fieldworks, sharpened stakes, and watchtowers, many bearing recent scars of war. The town itself lies within this second circle. It is constructed entirely of wood, and many of its outermost buildings have, over the years, been reduced to ash by Lencian firebombs. You learn from Prarg that Magnaarn<ch.apos/>s headquarters are located at the very centre, in a high tower which commands a clear view over the town and its defensive lines.</p>
      <p>At first sight the Shugkona defences look impregnable, but after having carefully observed the perimeter lines you note two places where, with luck, you might enter the town without being observed. The first is close to the east road where an expanse of cleared ground is guarded only by a watchtower. The second is a section of the perimeter, further south, where only one line of trenches has been completed.</p>

      <p>Inspired by your victory, the Lencians and their League-land allies repel the remaining Zagganozod and close their ranks until the square is intact once more. The enemy are now exhausted and wearily they retreat across the plain with the stinging cheers of their foes echoing in their ears.</p>
      <p>Then an ominous noise comes rolling across the plain from the city of Darke, a thunderous boom that shakes the very ground on which you stand. You look towards the city and see that the battle is growing ever fiercer. But now there is a new and sinister aspect. Flickerings of magical fire can be seen dancing along battlements, engulfing friend and foe alike. You sense that it is the work of Magnaarn; he and his Nadziranim allies are responsible for this.</p>
      <p>Then, through the smoke of battle, you see a Lencian flag flying proudly amidst the carnage that is taking place on the coastal plain to the south of the city. Here, King Sarnac<ch.apos/>s crusaders have turned an enemy flank and are storming its weakened centre. Maquin and Schera see the flag and, encouraged by the cheers of their own men, they decide to march at once in support of the crusaders<ch.apos/> brave attack.</p>
      <p>You wish them both good fortune, for you know the time has come to part company with these brave men. Their destiny awaits them on the field of battle; yours will be found inside the city of Darke itself where, if you are to fulfil your quest, you must confront Warlord Magnaarn.</p>
      <p>You bid them farewell and watch as they lead their men in a marching column across the plain towards the distant field of battle. When they are a mile away, you set off alone towards the hamlet, which lies <foreign xml:lang="fr">en route</foreign> to the gates of Darke.</p>

You are also very anxious that, under torture, he will reveal your presence, your identity, and the reason why you have come to this town.

      <p>In the distance you see a makeshift roadblock. Several trees have been hacked down and they are strewn haphazardly across the road. Behind this obstruction stand several armoured Drakkarim, waiting eagerly for you to appear.</p>
      <p>At once, you leave the road and take cover in the forest. The trees hereabouts are too dense to allow you to enter on horseback, so reluctantly you abandon the mare and enter on foot. Your instinct and Pathsmanship skills lead you in a westerly direction and you cover more than five miles before the trees begin to thin out. Then you emerge from the forest to be greeted by a spectacular sight.</p>

You hear splashes; then suddenly there is a loud thud and the rusty tip of an arrow punches its way through the side of the boat, stopping barely inches in front of your face. You hear the enemy<ch.apos/>s coarse laughter and you realize that they are simply using your boat for a spot of target practice. They are unaware that you are hiding inside. As you drift past them they rapidly lose interest in your craft. They put down their bows, pick up their makeshift fishing lines, and resume their efforts to catch themselves something to stave off their hunger.</p>

At first they back away, shocked by the speed of your reflexes, but rapidly their nerve returns and, half-crouched, they glare at you with their hideous, bulging eyes.

      <p>Suddenly your thoughts are disturbed by the rhythmic stamp of marching feet and your eyes are drawn to the avenue which runs alongside Magnaarn<ch.apos/>s headquarters. Down this thoroughfare come a regiment of Drakkarim. They file into the square and form up in three lines facing the platform. Then an open wagon, drawn by a brace of half-starved oxen, emerges from the alleyway beside the gaol. Captain Prarg is standing in the rear of the wagon with his hands tied behind his back. Despite the bumpy ride he stands rigidly at attention, proudly defiant in the face of imminent death. The wagon halts and the captain is dragged up onto the platform by three brutish gaolers. He is made to kneel down before the block as a Drakkarim officer hurriedly reads the contents of a scroll to the assembled troops. He is condemning the captain to death for spying. When he finishes the reading, he takes a two-handed axe from one of the gaolers and walks slowly across the platform towards the block. Clearly he intends to carry out the execution personally.</p>

      <p>You clamber over the bodies that are heaped chest-high around the shattered city gates; then you begin to fight your way steadily towards the centre of this terrible stronghold. Beyond the entrance you see that a wild battle is raging through the streets. A regiment of Lencian Crusaders are fighting to wrestle possession of the keep from a determined horde of Magnaarn<ch.apos/>s Drakkarim. The tide turns against the Lencians and as they are driven back towards the gates, you are forced to climb a stair which leads to the battlements in order to avoid being lost in the crush. Halfway up the steps you are attacked by a Drakkar armed with sword and shield. You duck his clumsy swipe and lash out at his chest. He catches your blow on his shield, but the sheer force of your attack hurls him down on the steps where he remains, cradling his broken arm, tears streaming down his soot-blackened face.</p>

Their lifeless bodies come tumbling down the steps, knocking you flat on your back and pinning you down beneath the weight of their armour. You struggle to get free, but you are being observed by the one who slew the knights: an evil Nadziranim wizard. He levels his staff at your head and a swirling trail of sparks ignites at its tip.

      <p>After your meal, you leave Prarg and climb to the top of the river bank. Here, using your Grand Mastery, you send forth a mental command into the surrounding forest, summoning creatures to your aid. At first there is no response; then a pair of white Nyras timber wolves appear at the forest<ch.apos/>s edge and, upon your command, they approach you. Normally these wolves are wild and feral creatures, slave to nothing save their natural instincts, yet your mastery over them is total; they are utterly compliant to your will.</p>
      <p>You command the two wolves to guard your camp while you and Prarg are sleeping. With a blink of their eyes they acknowledge your order and settle themselves on their haunches. You return to the boat and tell Prarg what you have done. At first he is sceptical, but having already witnessed some of your powers in action, he does not protest too hard, especially as he can now look forward to a long sleep without having to stand watch. Unfortunately for Prarg, his hopes for an uninterrupted night<ch.apos/>s rest are soon shattered.</p>

While you ponder what may await you in the future, you remain watchful and alert, for the risk of an attack by the denizens of this swamp is ever present. Fortunately, the cold dissuades them from leaving their lairs this night and your watch passes without incident. Then the time comes for you to awaken Prarg.

He is one of a dozen troopers who have been posted around the perimeter of the square to guard its many exits, but he is more interested in watching the execution than carrying out his duty.

      <p>Within the hour the final preparations for your airborne voyage to Lencia are completed, and Lord Floras and you are piped aboard the <cite>Skyrider</cite> by Bo<ch.apos/>sun Nolrim and his cheerful crew of dwarves. You exchange a few reminiscences with each of the jovial crewmen and cannot help but smile when they tell you how proud they feel to have been given the chance to serve you once more.</p>
      <p>Nolrim takes the helm and you sense a vibration run down the length of the deck as he coaxes the craft<ch.apos/>s powerful engine to life. Lord Floras joins you at the prow and together you wave a farewell to Rimoah and your fellow Kai as, steadily, the <cite>Skyrider</cite> ascends into the crisp, wintry sky. Then, with a sudden surge of power, the keel clears the battlements of the Tower of the Sun and swiftly the monastery and its inhabitants recede into the distance.</p>
      <p>You and your companion are escorted to a warm cabin at the bow which has been prepared especially for your passage. It is well stocked with provisions and, spread out across a grand oak table, you find several maps of Northern Magnamund. Aided by Lord Floras, you study these maps and use them to chart your course to the Lencian city-port of Vadera. Bo<ch.apos/>sun Nolrim is informed of your chosen route and, as he sets about implementing your course, you settle back to enjoy what will be a long voyage. By your calculations, it will take thirty hours for the <cite>Skyrider</cite> to reach its destination.</p>
      <p>During your voyage, Lord Floras recounts the dramatic events which have taken place in the Western Tentarias since the demise of the Darklords. Prior to their fall, the Drakkarim nations had for many centuries kept the Lencians at bay. Countless crusades had been undertaken to recapture their former lands but all had ended in costly defeat for the House of Sarnac. Then, two years ago, the tide finally turned when the King launched an invasion across the Gulf of Lencia into the lands of Zaldir and Nyras. The boldness of his strategy and the unpreparedness of his enemies combined to win for him many victories in the early months of the war. Much of Zaldir and all of southern Nyras were taken and held by his conquering knights, and now the lines of battle are drawn diagonally across the centre of Nyras, from Lake Lenag in the north to the marshland fortress of Lozonzee in the east. However, King Sarnac cannot lay claim to total victory in the south, for the cities of Shpyder and Darke have defied all his attempts at capture. Their Drakkarim garrisons have steadfastly held on to these important strongholds and, although they have been surrounded and besieged for more than a year, still they refuse to surrender.</p>

      <p><quote>At present, the war is focused around the towns of Hokidat and Konozod,</quote> says Lord Floras, tracing a circle around their location on the map with the tip of his index finger. <quote>Many battles have been fought here but victory has, as yet, eluded us. Now, with the onset of a cruel winter, our advance has ground to a halt. Maintaining the sieges at Shpyder and Darke has drained us of troops and resources that would have been put to better use in the north. To compensate for this shortage, the King has employed many companies of foreign mercenaries to reinforce his armies in the field, but their services are expensive and the campaign has already proved costly, both in revenue and lives. The King is hard-pressed to pay for their continued loyalty and already several regiments have deserted. If Magnaarn were to complete his quest and strike now, whilst our battle lines are weakened, his counterattack could push us all the way back to the sea.</quote></p>
      <p>Lord Floras<ch.apos/> report is sobering, yet it serves to strengthen your determination to thwart Magnaarn<ch.apos/>s quest. Later, shortly before nightfall, you leave the cabin and go up to the stern deck for a breath of fresh air. In quiet solitude you see the great expanse of the Slovarian Plain passing by more than a mile beneath the craft and, as you watch, you lose yourself in thoughts of what may await your arrival in Lencia. The night sky is clear and laced with twinkling stars. As you return to the cabin to sleep, you draw comfort from the thought that the weather and the stars have seen fit to help speed your night passage to Vadera.</p>

Sheepishly he follows as you creep forward through the snow, using the sparse undergrowth to your advantage wherever possible. You move deeper into the copse until you spy where the arrow came from. A small camp is hidden among the trees. It comprises four white canvas tents attended by a dozen lean and hungry-looking human soldiers armed with longbows.

Here you settle to observe the Drakkarim guards who are dutifully keeping watch over this sector. All you can see of them is their brutal faces peering over the rim of their dugout, but, after a while, one by one these faces disappear.

      <p>As your slain enemies keel over backwards and splash into the mire, you spin around to see your companion grappling with a Ciquali in a desperate hand-to-hand combat. Prarg has lost his sword and the fight is going badly for him. The creature is by far the largest of the attacking pack and much of its muscular body is protected by armour, crudely fashioned from human bones. Anxious to help your companion, you rush forward and strike the creature a mighty blow at the base of its skull, opening a fearful wound. For a few moments the Ciquali continues to fight on as if unaffected by your blow; then its webbed hands spring open, letting Prarg, who is barely conscious, fall limply to the bottom of the boat. The beast touches a hand to its shattered skull and a look of astonishment fixes upon its ugly face when it sees its gore-stained palm. You raise your weapon to strike again, to finish the creature once and for all, but a second blow proves unnecessary. Its eyes roll backwards in their sockets; then stiffly the Ciquali falls sideways over the gunwale and sinks without trace beneath the slimy water.</p>
      <p>As one, the remaining Ciquali turn away from the boat and disappear as quickly as they had come, slipping back to the cold, dark safety of their hiding places beneath the surface. Silence returns, and for a long moment you stand alert, suspecting trickery. Then slowly you relax; they have gone.</p>
      <p>Aided by your healing skills, Prarg makes a speedy recovery from the battering he sustained in combat with the Ciquali chieftain. The boat, too, has survived the attack and you are able to continue without further delay. As soon as you pass the obstruction, you hoist the sail and catch the prevailing wind which propels you northwards along the channel beyond.</p>
      <p>You are hungry after your encounter. Unless you possess Grand Huntmastery, you must now eat a Meal or lose 3 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points.</p>

      <p>You clamber out of the cellar and set off after the Drakkarim with weapon in hand, determined to free your companion from their clutches, but as you hurry into the western avenue you see that they have already joined with the troops who are escorting the covered wagon. The wagon has halted and you count more than fifty Drakkarim jostling the helpless Prarg, bullying and cursing him vilely. More than one voice calls out in the Giak tongue<ch.emdash/><quote>Let<ch.apos/>s kill the Lencian spy!</quote></p>
      <p>Fearful that they are going to beat him to death, you decide to charge headlong into the crowd in a desperate attempt to save him, despite the overwhelming odds against your success. But before you can act, a Drakkarim officer on horseback appears and commands the troops to order. An uneasy silence descends on the group; then dutifully they step away from Prarg and form up in a column facing the officer and his mount. Prarg, who has been left lying on the ground, barely conscious, is bundled into the wagon. The officer raises his hand and the wagon trundles off along the avenue towards a distant square, with the troop of soldiers marching smartly in its wake.</p>
      <p>You follow and observe, taking in every aspect, every detail that might help you to free your companion. When you reach the square at the end of the avenue, you discover that it is dominated by a tall tower. It is Magnaarn<ch.apos/>s tower. His flag, emblazoned with the emblem of a black eagle clutching two fiery swords, flutters lazily from its slender wooden spire. The wagon draws up in front of a building adjacent to the tower and Prarg is dragged unceremoniously inside. Judging by the bars which adorn its windows, and the armed guards at its entrance, you hazard a guess that this is the Shugkona Gaol.</p>

Then the assembled troops are galvanized into action when an order from their officer sends them off in pairs to search the town for other spies. Several Drakkarim come towards your location and you are forced to seek somewhere to hide. Looking around you can see only two dwellings that may offer some hope of a safe haven.

      <p>Huddled together in a corner of the compound, away from the other prisoners, is a small group of men-at-arms. The fronts of their tattered blue coats bear the emblem of a crown set above the crest of Vadera identifying them to be of the same regiment<ch.emdash/>the Imperial Vadera Guard<ch.emdash/>one of Lencia<ch.apos/>s finest. Using your Magnakai skills to avoid detection, you make your way to the fence and try to attract their attention. One of their number, a captain, sees you and is immediately suspicious. You signal to him to come closer and, reluctantly at first, he crawls towards the fence.</p>

They are an unwelcome sight, the precursors to a winter storm.</p>
      <p>Prarg volunteers to continue the first watch but, mindful that his need for rest is greater than yours, you insist that he gets some sleep. For four hours you sit and scan the bleak horizon, your mind filled with unanswered questions about the mission and the dangers you have yet to face. While you ponder what awaits you in the near future, you remain watchful and alert, your encounter on the east bank still vivid in your mind. Fortunately, the increasing cold dissuades the Hellswamp<ch.apos/>s inhabitants from leaving their lairs this night and your watch passes without further incident.</p>
      <p>Then the time comes for you to awaken Prarg. With a noticeable lack of enthusiasm he takes his turn while you settle yourself down to catch a few hours of much needed sleep.</p>

An aura of evil surrounds his body like a shimmering grey cocoon, and his features no longer appear as they did when first you encountered him in the subterranean labyrinths of the Temple of Antah. Now his body is twisted and mummy-like, and feverish eyes burn from black sockets within a bald skull of a face.

The Warlord<ch.apos/>s sick eyes widen with surprise and you sense that he is fearful. He threatens you with death, but his voice is wavering. He is unsure of his power. Then you sense another presence, a magical presence. A wispy shape emerges from behind another curtain, summoned forth by Magnaarn, and at once you recognize it to be the formless life-force of a Nadziranim sorcerer. You hear Magnaarn issue a psychic command, ordering the creature to slay you, and immediately it responds. Swiftly it moves across the chamber, changing shape as it draws closer. It is no more than ten feet distant when it solidifies into a form which is truly horrifying to behold.</p>

      <p>As you step away from the dead guards, you hear shouts of alarm outside the building: the roof of the stables has just erupted into a sheet of flame. The garrison is thrown into a state of near-panic as it tries to fight the fire and contain the horses which are stampeding through the streets.</p>
      <p>You run the length of the armoury and hurriedly lift the massive drawbar which holds the main doors closed. Outside, you see the perimeter guards are abandoning their posts in order to fight the fire now raging through the stables. The Lencians are on their feet. They are grouped by the entrance to the compound and, as the last of the guards leaves, they rush forward and barge open the gates. Led by the captain, they come streaming across the flagstoned square towards the armoury, sweeping aside any Drakkarim foolish enough to try to turn this vengeful tide. With a cheer they pour into the armoury and equip themselves with weapons from its many racks of spears and swords.</p>
      <p><quote>Let<ch.apos/>s take this town!</quote> shouts the captain, and amid stirring battle-cries of <quote>Lencia</quote> and <quote>For the House of Sarnac</quote>, the starving Lencians set off to obey his command.</p>
      <p>You try to reach the captain, whose name you learn is Schera, but before you reach him you are swept out into the street and carried along by this crowd of battle-hungry soldiers.</p>

A sparkling bolt, which was destined to seal your doom, arcs from his staff and blows a man-sized hole in the wall of the fortress. As the resultant smoke and dust slowly clears, you see Captain Prarg standing over the body of the slain wizard with a bloodied sword held in his hand. With a cry of victory, he leaps over the crumpled corpse and comes rushing down the steps to help free you from the tangle of bodies.</p>

      <p>The dark alleyway leads to a square where, an age ago, the grand mansions of Lencian noblemen encircled a shrine dedicated to the Goddess Ishir, High Priestess of the Moon. But now this square, in common with the rest of the town, bears little resemblance to, or trace of, its Lencian origins. When the Drakkarim first captured Ferndour, as it was then called, all the houses and public buildings which had stood for centuries were demolished. In their place were erected ungainly dormitories and ugly communal dwellings made entirely of timber culled from the surrounding forest. The town<ch.apos/>s once-picturesque plazas and narrow, winding streets were replaced with coldly functional military avenues for the marching Drakkarim hordes.</p>
      <p>From the shadows of a doorway, you and Prarg observe a small covered wagon and a troop of weary Drakkarim soldiers entering the square from the north. This small procession swings right and approaches an avenue which exits the square, leading off to the west towards the centre of the town. Magnaarn<ch.apos/>s headquarters are located in the middle of Shugkona and, with night fast approaching, Prarg suggests you follow the troop using the gathering darkness for cover. You are about to agree with him when suddenly the door of a nearby hovel swings open, and out into the alley step three burly, drunken Drakkarim.</p>
      <p>Instinctively you both leap for cover to avoid being seen. Prarg drops down behind a stack of empty ale casks, whilst you dive behind a mound of rotten timbers. The moment you hit the ground you feel it sag beneath your weight; then, in a moment of terror, the ground collapses and you fall headlong into darkness. You have crashed through the rot-infested timbers of a trapdoor into a damp and dingy cellar.</p>

The Gorodons increase their speed and come pounding through the shallows, their eyes blazing and their horns lowered in eager readiness to impale you on their razor-sharp tips. They are almost upon you when, with a blink of your eyes, you hurl your psychic pulses directly into their brains. The effect is instantaneous and devastating. It is as if all three have been felled simultaneously by a massive hammer blow to the skull.<footref id="sect190-1" idref="sect190-1-foot"/></p>
      <p>The Gorodons<ch.apos/> forelegs buckle and they are brought down head-first into the muddy shallows. Their horns sink deeply into the silt whilst their heavy torsos are thrown forwards by the momentum of their charge. For a few seconds they cartwheel end-over-end; then, with a chilling abruptness, they cease moving and settle into the mud. Your psychic attack was devastating but it did not kill them outright; it was the massive strain placed upon their necks when they fell that ultimately sealed their doom.</p>

You call upon your Kai skills and immediately you sense a strong presence of evil lurking at the end of the right-hand passage. You focus on the source of this evil and determine that it is the Doomstone. You tell Prarg and together you advance along the passage until you reach a closed door.</p>

Silently you stare across the lake at the distant tree-line and your mind is filled with doubt. The Temple of Antah lies beyond, of that you are sure, and the quickest way to reach it would be to traverse the lake, but there is no cover and no way of knowing if the ice is thick enough to support you all the way across.

You move closer and discover they belong to a Lencian soldier who is badly wounded and barely conscious. Schera helps you to clear away the charred timbers that are pinning him to the ground and, using your Kai healing skills, you attend to the man<ch.apos/>s wounds.

The captain<ch.apos/>s men have managed to clear a passage wide enough for the flotilla to pass through in single file, and as you continue your journey down-river, you spend some time nursing the injured soldier back to consciousness. He tells you of the battle that destroyed his regiment, of how Magnaarn used his sceptre to set the town ablaze, and of how he has survived the last six days sustained by nothing more than a few handfuls of snow. His account of the battle is chilling and it leaves you with a gnawing fear that maybe it is already too late to prevent Warlord Magnaarn from regaining control of Darke.</p>

      <p>From out of the shadows of the secret passage steps Warlord Magnaarn. He is a huge man<ch.emdash/>not much over six feet tall but massively built. His body is sheathed in finely crafted armour that fits his frame like a glove, and his features are coarse and foreboding, accentuated by a fresh battle scar which runs diagonally from the top of his red-haired scalp to a point near the lobe of his left ear.</p>
      <p>Arrogantly he approaches the portcullis and stares unblinkingly into your eyes. For a moment you consider attacking him, but your senses detect that he is surrounded by a field of energy so strong that already you feel it leeching your psychic powers. He reaches to a pocket inside his cloak and takes out a large black gemstone, which he holds level with his sneering face. Scarlet veins glow within the depths of this stone, swirling and undulating as if they are alive. Waves of dizziness force you to your knees as the evil power of the Doomstone of Darke washes over you, bleeding you of the strength and will to resist.</p>

They have no knowledge of their master<ch.apos/>s request and are suspicious. As you ascend the ramp, one of the guards levels his spear and points it threateningly at your chest.</p>

The moment it disappears, you leave the river<ch.apos/>s edge and set off into the trees.</p>
      <p>Deep in the forest the snowfall is light underfoot, because of the thick canopy of branches overhead, and you find the going much easier than expected. You are struck by the unexpected beauty of this dense timberland in winter, by the intricate webs of frost that trail between its blue-green branches, and by its frozen streams and waterfalls. But even as you admire it, you remain ever conscious of its dangers. Prarg leads the way, and swiftly you progress from one concealed marker to another, all having been placed by him on previous missions behind enemy lines. By using his system of hidden signposts he is able to guide you safely through a maze of Drakkarim outposts and patrol routes that riddle this timberland.</p>
      <p>It is nearing noon and you have covered more than twenty miles when Prarg motions you to halt: he has found something unexpected. Nailed to a trunk is a small rectangle of orange-coloured metal.</p>
      <p><quote>This is a Drakkarim marker,</quote> he says, after closer examination. <quote>They use them to mark the perimeter boundaries of their forest camps. It wasn<ch.apos/>t here the last time I came this way which means there must be a new outpost here, somewhere close.</quote></p>
      <p><quote>How close?</quote> you ask.</p>
      <p><quote>Within half a mile at most.</quote></p>
      <p>For a few moments you stop and listen to the silence of the forest. You close your eyes and concentrate, and through the use of your aural skills, you detect noises away to the north. The sounds are mixed and many, and you are unable to discern their exact cause.</p>

      <p>Beyond the doors you discover a large echoing hall, lit by a circle of torches which flare dimly in the moist gloom. The atmosphere is saturated with a malevolent power, an evil that is welling up from somewhere deep below ground. Immediately to your right you see a ladder which ascends to the upper floor of the tower, and to your left there is a wide staircase which leads down. Your senses scream a warning as you approach this staircase and begin to descend, but this time you choose to ignore your trusty instincts. The aura of evil which pervades this place has its source, and you are certain that it is the Doomstone of Darke, the very object you have sworn to destroy.</p>
      <p>The staircase leads down to a winding torchlit hallway which passes through a series of narrow chambers, all empty and derelict. Eventually, you come to an iron portal and you stop for a few moments to examine the intricate engravings that embellish its age-blackened surface. Quickly you realize that the engravings are not mere decorations, they are part of a sophisticated combination lock which holds this door secure.</p>

      <p>The driver shouts a rude greeting to the guards at the main gates as they pull them open, allowing the cart to pass through into the town unchallenged. You stay hidden beneath the straw until the cart slows to a halt; then, very carefully, you raise your head and take a look around. You have stopped in a muddy alley which runs between a stables and an armoury. This alley opens on to a central square that has been turned into a prisoner of war compound. It is enclosed by a crude fence of wire and sharpened stakes, and is patrolled by sentries with Akataz war-dogs. You estimate at least two hundred Lencians are being held captive here, and in conditions that are shocking to behold. The men are being kept out in the open, without shelter or heat of any kind, and judging by their physical state, it looks as if the Drakkarim are purposefully starving them to death.</p>
      <p>Shock soon turns to anger and you vow that you will do whatever you can to save these prisoners. Unseen, you slip from the rear of the cart and wait in the shadows until the chance comes for you to approach the fence and make contact with the Lencians.</p>

      <p>The sounds of the struggle cease abruptly and you hear gruff Drakkarim voices yelling and cursing in anger. A yellowy light flares up and grows brighter as it approaches the broken trapdoor. Then the face of a Drakkar appears, framed in the ragged hole, illuminated grotesquely by the guttering flames of a torch. The Drakkar thrusts the torch through the shattered door and peers into the cellar, his small piggy eyes probing into every corner. You keep completely still, and he fails to see you lying beneath the clutter of barrels and casks.</p>

The Drakkarim have captured Prarg; they have tied his hands and they are marching him along the west avenue towards the centre of the town, towards Magnaarn<ch.apos/>s headquarters.</p>

      <p>Having decided to follow Magnaarn<ch.apos/>s tracks, you are now faced with the unwelcome prospect of a tiring foot-slog through the Tozaz Forest, unless, of course, you can find some other means of speeding your journey. Using your Kai Mastery, you scan the surrounding woodland and send out a silent call for help A few minutes pass, and then a wild dog appears. He is soon joined by a handful of other creatures: a young grey-skinned boar, two feral snow-cats, and an ape-like Rhudun. Unfortunately, none are large or sturdy enough to carry you any great distance.</p>
      <p>Then, from out of the snow-laden undergrowth, bursts forth a wild stag. It is a magnificent animal, as large and as strong as any stallion. Subdued by your commands, it approaches and tilts its antlered head to allow you to climb upon its back. Obediently it responds as you steer it through the forest, heading westwards in the wake of Magnaarn<ch.apos/>s troops.</p>
      <p>Shortly after dusk you come to the banks of the River Shug, close by a small settlement of log huts which are grouped around a derelict ferry post. You dismount, and with a slap to its rump, you send the stag trotting back to its forest home.

      <p>As you ride along this road of frozen earth, the sky begins to darken ominously and the weather closes in. What begins as a light flurry of snow soon deteriorates into an icy squall which cuts through you like a knife. Your Magnakai skills protect you from the cold, but Captain Prarg is not so fortunate. He utters not a word of complaint but you can sense that he is in great discomfort. Moreover, your horse, already tired from the exertions of the escape, is greatly weakened by the icy winds. Eventually it can carry you no further and you are forced to halt and dismount.</p>

      <p>Many hours pass before you regain consciousness, and although your terrible ordeal has left you physically weakened, your mind is still as sharp and resolute as ever. You are determined to find a route to the surface and continue your quest, for even though Magnaarn now has Captain Prarg and the Doomstone of Darke, there may yet be a way you can defeat him. Before he entombed you in the passage he admitted that you alone posed a threat to his quest for victory over Lencia. Now that he thinks you dead and buried, you feel sure you can turn this to your advantage.</p>
      <p>You stagger to your feet and peer along the gloomy passageway in either direction, east and west. You are anxious to pursue a route that will lead you quickly to the surface, and when you detect cold, damp air wafting from the west, you hurry this way. But you are soon disappointed. The passageway ends abruptly at the edge of a vast chasm, formed by the same destructive powers which buried you alive. At the bottom of this great fissure is a river of black water, and high above, you glimpse a few rays of winter daylight filtering through a tiny rent in the darkness. It looks so far distant that you abandon any thought of reaching it from here and return along the passageway.</p>
      <p>A few hundred yards beyond where you emerged, you discover an octagonal chamber that is bathed by an eerie green light. This light is emitted by fungi which blanket the walls and ceiling and illuminate a strange circular door that has an octagonal lock. You have been in the chamber for no more than a few seconds when your senses detect something is wrong. Invisible fumes are rising from the fungi, which, in your weakened state, are making you feel dizzy and nauseous.</p>

      <p>The order goes out to advance quickly towards the distant hamlet. But you have covered barely a quarter of a mile when you see enemy horsemen fast approaching from the north. Mindful of the danger of being caught out here in the open, Baron Maquin orders his mercenaries to form into a square in readiness to repel a cavalry attack. Captain Schera issues the same order to his men, and together they create a square that is bristling with spears.</p>
      <p>The cavalry thunder towards you, undaunted by the sight of this porcupine-like defence. The first wave of Drakkarim cavalry slams against the square and is repulsed with heavy losses; then a second line hits home and it, too, fails to break through. The wounded are dragged to the centre of the square and the ranks close in readiness to face the next charge. Twice the Drakkarim have been repulsed but they are a determined enemy and they are getting ready to attack again. This time the charge is led by armoured Zagganozod, on warhorses that are sheathed with plates of bronze. Their armour<ch.emdash/>and the sheer weight of their attack<ch.emdash/>smashes a corner of the square and, in a terrible moment of carnage and chaos, several enemy horsemen break into the middle of the square and trample the helpless wounded.</p>

      <p>You rise at dawn and peer out of the cabin porthole to be greeted by a wondrous sight, for the <cite>Skyrider</cite> is now flying west along the Tentarias, the great divide that parts the two continents of Magnamund. You are soaring more than a mile above blue-green waters which shimmer in the early morning sun. Sunlight is also reflecting from the snow-capped mountain peaks of the Great Bor and Boradon Mountains which rise up on either side to form a gigantic corridor of unyielding stone. Fondly the crew cast their eyes across the northern landscape, for this is the magnificent realm of Bor, the place of their birth, and many years have elapsed since they last visited their native land.</p>
      <p>The weather remains clear and swift progress is made as the <cite>Skyrider</cite> follows its course along the Tentarias towards the Gulf of Lencia. By mid-morning you pass within a few miles of Humbold, capital of Eru; then emerge from the mountain corridor to a less enchanting sight. To the north, as far as the eye can see, stretches a dull and sickly mire. It is the infamous Hellswamp, an infernal morass of twisted vegetation and treacherous, shifting mudflats. Slowly the hours pass and the anticipation of your arrival at Vadera steadily grows. Then, at two hours past noon, the lookout catches first sight of the city-port nestling in its protected bay along the Lencian coast. You join Nolrim at the prow as skilfully he begins a descent towards the main square, the only place large enough to accommodate the craft in the closely packed quarters of this populous city.</p>
      <p>At first, the sight of the <cite>Skyrider</cite> gliding towards their city causes a wave of panic among the Vaderans, who mistake it for a Drakkarim machine of war. But this initial fear is soon assuaged when the tower lookouts pass word that your mast bears a Sommlending flag. Upon landing, masses of curious citizens surge from out of the surrounding streets to form a ring of bodies around the airship<ch.apos/>s keel. Then a troop of armoured guardsmen push through the crowds and the air is filled with the buzz of their excited speculation. After a brief consultation with Lord Floras, they escort you both to the Vadera Citadel for an immediate audience with King Sarnac.</p>

It is filled with the spoils of battle: items of value which they have taken from prisoners or stolen from the dead.</p>
      <p>They laugh greedily until they hear the gruff shouts of their sergeant who is standing at the main gates, shouting out their names. Quickly they hide their booty in a hole beneath an empty horse trough; then they leave the alleyway and hurry back to the town.</p>

      <p>The dark alleys and streets surrounding the gaol are illuminated by a hundred guttering brands. Magnaarn<ch.apos/>s soldiers are everywhere, casting their suspicious eyes over every section of the nighted town laid bare by their torches. Your Kai skills keep you hidden from sight and soon you reach the gaol, but only to discover that the entrance is now heavily guarded by a platoon of Drakkarim.</p>
      <p>You abandon your hopes of entering by the front door and instead you circle around to an alley at the rear of the building where you discover a line of windows, each one criss-crossed with iron bars. Instinct leads you to the last in the line and you peer inside to see Captain Prarg lying on a bed of filthy straw. He looks in poor shape; both his eyes are bruised, his lips are swollen, and his bushy moustache is caked with dried blood. You whisper his name and wearily he turns his head towards the cell window. Then he sees you and suddenly his whole face lights up with renewed hope.</p>
      <p><quote>Thank the gods you are still free, Lone Wolf,</quote> he says quietly, pressing his battered face to the bars. <quote>The Drakkarim have tried to make me talk but I have kept silent. They know nothing about the mission.</quote></p>
      <p>You examine the cell window and reassure Prarg that you will soon spring him from this gaol, but he insists that you do not risk your life on his account.</p>
      <p><quote>Listen, Sire. I have learned that Magnaarn isn<ch.apos/>t here in Shugkona. When the gaolers beat me, I feigned unconsciousness and overheard them say that their leader is at a place called Antah. It<ch.apos/>s a ruined temple some forty miles away to the north. They talked of certain victory now that their warlord has found <quote>the stone</quote>. Please, Lone Wolf, I beseech you to continue without me. Go to Antah and defeat Magnaarn, before it is too late.</quote></p>
      <p>Then a yellowy flicker of torchlight at the end of the alley cuts short your conversation. It is a Drakkarim patrol. They turn the corner and come marching towards you with purposeful steps.</p>
      <p><quote>Don<ch.apos/>t give up hope, captain,</quote> you say, as you make ready to run from the approaching patrol. <quote>I<ch.apos/>ll come back for you.</quote></p>

      <p>You send one of the scouts to summon Captain Schera and his men, and when they arrive they are treated most hospitably by the mercenaries who, despite their own hunger, unselfishly share out their meagre rations.</p>
      <p>You stay here overnight and break camp at dawn. The Baron<ch.apos/>s regiment has suffered heavily in battle and now totals little more than forty men, and so you have no difficulty in finding room for them in the boats. Captain Schera is especially pleased to have these warriors aboard. Despite their losses, they are a cheerful group and they help lift the morale of his men.</p>
      <p>The journey downstream passes swiftly and without incident until, shortly before noon, the sky grows steadily darker. An orange glow illuminates the distant horizon, and you can see many pinpoints of fire spread all across the land. An eerie silence descends on the flotilla as it draws nearer to the city of Darke. Shortly after, you see lines of troops marching towards the glowing skyline. Then you witness isolated actions taking place in the surrounding fields as groups of Lencian knights, cut off during the retreat, fight desperate hand-to-hand battles with Drakkarim cavalry. Some Drakkarim horse scouts have reached the river bank, and as you pass them, they open fire at you with their bows. But the swift current soon carries the flotilla away and there are few casualties.</p>

      <p>It is an hour past noon when you first see the forbidding city of Darke. A great battle is raging around its mighty walls and bastions, and the noise and stench of this fierce conflict comes gusting towards you on the chill winter wind. The river current is getting stronger as it approaches the sea, and so you signal to the other boats to row for the bank. You put ashore on the right bank and both Captain Schera and Baron Maquin have their men take up defensive positions here. There is a road close by, running parallel to the river, and beyond it lies a snowy expanse of open plain on which many regiments of Drakkarim, and some Giaks, are marching towards the city. You are observing the distant battle when a large black carrion crow lands on a nearby log and stares at you with a cold, beady eye.</p>

      <p>You sense that he is a veteran of many battles who, now that he is too old to fight, has been given the undemanding task of guarding this river crossing. Mindful that time is fast running out, you leave the window and hurry on towards the stables.</p>

      <p>The remaining Gorodon utters a high-pitched and piercing whistle as your killing blow steals its life. Its massive limbs shudder and stiffen; then, with a final gasp, it topples over and lands heavily in the thick mud.</p>
      <p>Prarg brings the boat back to shore and, as he draws closer, you can see by his facial expression that he is greatly impressed by your incredible fighting skills. Respectfully he helps you aboard the boat then sets about rowing towards the west bank.</p>
      <p><quote>Sire, I salute you,</quote> he says. <quote>Never have I seen such courage and skill in the face of so formidable an enemy. I<ch.apos/>ve heard tell of the fighting disciplines of the Sommlending Kai Lords, but, until now, I must admit I<ch.apos/>d not wholly believed what I<ch.apos/>d heard. The first time I navigated these channels I lost three good men in a Gorodon attack. Those beasts are the bane of this accursed place<ch.ellips/>yet, <ch.apos/>tis true to say, there are other creatures here that are far deadlier. I count myself lucky indeed to be your guide.</quote></p>
      <p>Soon you reach the west bank where, once safely ashore, you encamp on a strip of frozen loam that overlooks a bleak expanse of marsh. Night has fallen and so, too, has the temperature. From the shelter of your upturned boat you cast your experienced eye across the darkening skies and see banks of cloud, heavy with snow, scudding the distant horizon. They are an unwelcome sight, the precursors to a winter storm.</p>
      <p>Prarg volunteers to continue the first watch but, mindful that his need for rest is greater than yours, you insist that he gets some sleep. For four hours you sit and scan the bleak horizon, your mind filled with unanswered questions about the mission and the dangers you have yet to face. While you ponder what awaits you in the near future, you remain watchful and alert, your encounter on the east bank still vivid in your mind. Fortunately, the increasing cold dissuades the Hellswamp<ch.apos/>s inhabitants from leaving their lairs this night and your watch passes without further incident.</p>
      <p>Then the time comes for you to awaken Prarg. With a noticeable lack of enthusiasm he takes his turn while you settle down to catch a few hours of much needed sleep.</p>

Then, all of a sudden, you are plunged into the battle and to survive you are forced to cleave your way through a seemingly endless wall of enemy troops. It is as if they are gladly willing to sacrifice themselves in order to prevent you from reaching the apex of the slope that ascends to the shattered gates of the city. Undeterred, you forge a bloody path through this Drakkarim horde, wielding your weapon with deadly precision, every blow claiming an enemy soul. It is not until you are standing upon the very threshold of the gates that you encounter more formidable defenders. The breached gates are being held by a trio of blood-spattered Tukodak. They are in a state of battle-frenzy which you sense has been magically induced. Wild-eyed with savage bloodlust, they scream maniacally as they rush at you with their bloodied blades.</p>

You are forced to make a wide detour to the west in order to avoid these returning soldiers and your new route takes you across a steep and rugged part of the Tozaz Forest previously unexplored by your guide.</p>
      <p>The difficult terrain slows you down and you cover less than six miles before failing light and the increasing sightings of Drakkarim patrols force you to halt and make camp for the night. From the safety of a treetop, fifty feet above the forest floor, you rope yourself to the trunk before settling down to sleep. You are hungry and, unless you possess the Discipline of Grand Huntmastery, you must now eat a Meal or lose 3 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points.</p>

      <p>You ship the oars and take aim with your bow at the pot-bellied leader of this band of lowly Drakkarim renegades. For a moment your eyes meet and instantly his nerve shatters when he realizes that he is your chosen target. He drops his bow and turns to run, but it does not save him; your Arrow still finds its mark. As he throws his hands to the sky and tumbles lifelessly into the river, panic breaks out among his motley followers. Any attempt to fire at you is soon forgotten as they scramble desperately up the muddy bank and flee for the safety of the hills.</p>
      <p>Your voyage continues without interruption until, later in the afternoon, you catch sight of a town on the horizon. You check your <a idref="map">map</a> and discover it to be Konozod, a fortified Drakkarim stronghold.

      <p>After what seems like an eternity, you reach the icy cold waters of the Gourneni and hurriedly launch your boat. Prarg scrambles over the stern, but as the aft drips beneath his weight, the rudder embeds itself in the mud and the boat is held fast.</p>
      <p><quote>Hurry Prarg! Break out the oars!</quote> you shout. <quote>I<ch.apos/>ll push!</quote></p>
      <p>The Gorodons are gaining ground; you can hear the rasping rush of their breathing as they close in for the kill. Desperately you press your shoulder to the stern timbers and push with all your might. There is a shudder; then suddenly the boat lurches forwards and you fall face first into the freezing water. You surface almost immediately and blink the muddy water from your eyes to see the boat drifting away towards the middle of the river. Prarg is leaning over the gunwale with his arms outstretched:</p>
      <p><quote>Quickly, Lone Wolf!</quote> he screams. <quote>They<ch.apos/>re nearly upon you!</quote></p>
      <p>Sensing that it would be quicker to swim than wade towards the boat, you bring your hands together in readiness to dive. But before you can launch yourself forwards, you feel something sharp graze your shoulders. An instant later, you are lifted out of the river and hurled backwards through the air to land, with a thick splash, in the mud at the water<ch.apos/>s edge. One of the Gorodons caught your cloak upon its bull-like horns and, with a flick of its powerful neck muscles, it has tossed you all the way back to the shoreline.</p>
      <p>Cold, stunned, and covered with mud, you struggle to find your feet and unsheathe your weapon as the three Gorodons come lumbering through the shallows, eager to kill and consume.</p>

      <p>The chilling echo of Magnaarn<ch.apos/>s voice is drowned by new sounds: the rattle of chains and the rumble of falling stone. You shout a warning to Prarg and he dives aside only just in time to avoid being crushed by a heavy portcullis. The great stone portal slams down, partitioning the passageway and separating you from the captain. The dust has barely settled when a section of the passage wall slides open behind Prarg, and a trio of Magnaarn<ch.apos/>s Tukodak bodyguards leap out and seize him. Your companion is unarmed and he is quickly and brutally overpowered. Anger floods your mind and you vow to get even with these cruel Drakkarim, but they are not impressed by your threat. They are aware of your exceptional skills yet they feel safe behind the portcullis. With a knife held to Prarg<ch.apos/>s throat they taunt you and dare you to retaliate.</p>

      <p>Suddenly the gentle buzzing becomes an angry drone. Then from out of the lowest nest comes a swarm of wasp-like insects, each as large as a clenched fist. Alerted by your body warmth, they hurtle down the shaft and gather in a menacing cloud around the opening. For a few moments they hover there, virtually motionless; then they begin to circle the ceiling, led by an insect whose vivid scarlet markings stand out in stark contrast to the black and yellow striped torsos of the others.</p>

      <p>As the encircling swarm gathers speed, the lower section of their bodies begins to glow, illuminating needle-like stingers in their tails. You draw your weapon and get ready to defend yourself lest they should attack, but you are caught off-guard when suddenly the leading insects fire their stingers at you. Diving aside, you avoid being hit by this volley of venom-tipped needles, but as you scramble to your feet the remainder of the swarm break away and dive down to attack your unprotected back.</p>

      <p>Using your Huntmastery skills, you identify and gather up a handful of edible roots, fungi, and berries from the forest floor which you then offer to Prarg. At first he thinks you are joking. Then, once you assure him that they are nutritious, he accepts this dubious selection and starts to eat.</p>
      <p><quote>Damn rabbit food,</quote> he mumbles, but you notice that he is careful not to waste a crumb. Meanwhile, you scan the surrounding forest, ever watchful for enemies. For the last hour you have had a growing suspicion that something has been watching you. Your senses detect the presence of a hostile enemy, closing from the east. Now the suspicion has become a sure belief, and the moment Prarg finishes his meal, you suggest that you be on your way as swiftly as possible.</p>

      <p>Shaken but unharmed, you wade out to the boat where Prarg helps you aboard.</p>
      <p><quote>That was too close for comfort,</quote> says Prarg, as he struggles to free the oars and set them in place.</p>
      <p><quote>You can count yourself lucky to have escaped with your life. The first time I navigated these channels I lost three good men in a Gorodon attack. Those beasts are the bane of this accursed place<ch.ellips/>yet, <ch.apos/>tis true to say, there are other creatures here that are far deadlier.</quote></p>
      <p>Using the oars you soon reach the west bank where, once safely ashore, you encamp on a strip of frozen loam that overlooks a bleak expanse of marsh. Night has fallen and so, too, has the temperature. From the shelter of your upturned boat you cast your experienced eye across the darkening skies and see banks of cloud, heavy with snow, scudding the distant horizon. They are an unwelcome sight, the precursors to a winter storm.</p>
      <p>Prarg volunteers to continue the first watch but, mindful that his need for rest is greater than yours, you insist that he gets some sleep. For four hours you sit and scan the bleak horizon, your mind filled with unanswered questions about the mission and the dangers you have yet to face. While you ponder what awaits you in the near future, you remain watchful and alert, your encounter on the east bank still vivid in your mind. Fortunately, the increasing cold dissuades the Hellswamp<ch.apos/>s inhabitants from leaving their lairs this night and your watch passes without incident.</p>
      <p>Then the time comes for you to awaken Prarg. With a noticeable lack of enthusiasm he takes his turn while you settle yourself down to catch a few hours of much needed sleep.</p>

Its distended belly skims the floor as it stalks closer, and a brown gluey saliva runs freely from its fanged lower jaw. With the rockfall preventing a hasty escape, you draw your weapon and steel yourself for combat with this nightmarish creature.</p>

He is a tall man, clad from neck to toe in furs that are caked with frost. A battered silver helm hides much of his battle-scarred face, but you can see enough of his distinctly Ilionian features to know at once that he is a brave man, a man of honour. He regards you with a sceptical eye, having never before met a Sommlending lord, let alone one such as you. He questions you at length, and upon hearing your story, you sense that he is greatly impressed. In return he tells you briefly of how he and his men have come to find themselves here.</p>

You dodge this missile with ease, but it has served its purpose; it has bought the sergeant the time he needs to unsheathe his heavy-bladed sword.

      <p>You are about to abandon the body when suddenly you notice something gleaming in the top of its left boot.

      <p>From the top of the shaft you look out across the sprawling ruins of Antah. You have emerged upon the flat roof of a mouldering stone crypt situated a few hundred yards from the tower by which you first entered the subterranean temple. A chill wind howls in the surrounding trees and overhead the darkening winter sky warns that night is fast approaching.</p>
      <p>The ruins are completely deserted. The undisturbed blanket of snow which lies thick upon the ground, hiding all tracks, sorely reminds you that fifteen precious days have elapsed since your internment. You think of Captain Prarg and wonder if he is still alive, and an empty feeling gnaws at your stomach when you pause to consider the fate which may have befallen him and his Lencian countrymen now that Magnaarn is in possession of the Doomstone. You are fearful, but you are not entirely without hope. Magnaarn believes you to be dead; it is a belief that you could use to your advantage. After all, by his own admission, did he not say that you were the only threat to his victory?</p>
      <p>Carefully you descend from the roof of the crypt and make your way through the forest to where, two weeks earlier, Magnaarn<ch.apos/>s Tukodak guards were encamped. In this clearing there are no visible remains of their campsite, but diligently you sift through the ankle-deep snow, looking for clues to where they may have gone.</p>

      <p>Pain knifes along your limbs but you draw upon your inner strength to control and lessen the agony of your wounds. Moments later your horse slams into the sentries and they are trampled mercilessly beneath its hooves. Then you are through the gap in the barricade and racing along the road beyond. You have passed successfully through the inner defensive line, but, as Prarg quickly points out, you have yet to reach the outer defences of Shugkona.</p>

      <p>Hurriedly you and Prarg fix the oars in place and row with all your strength, retracing your route all the way back to where the channel first divided. Once here, you slow your boat to a halt and take some time to reconsider your plans.</p>
      <p>Reluctantly you decide to navigate the left channel. Rather than run the risk of making any noise, you stow the oars and allow the stinking marsh wind to propel your boat along the channel, albeit at a far slower speed. Gradually you approach the cluster of huts and, as you pass before them, you see eight dwellings, each built of mud-daubed roots and thatched with rotting vegetation. They are empty but they have not been deserted. The shoreline is littered with bones, the remnants of past meals, and nearby is a crude wooden frame on which the skins of a snake and a lizard have been stretched out to dry.</p>
      <p><quote>It<ch.apos/>s a Ciquali camp,</quote> whispers Prarg nervously, his eyes scouring the surrounding waters for the slightest sign of movement.

      <p>As soon as you lose sight of the settlement, you hoist the sail and catch the prevailing wind which propels you northwards along Dakushna<ch.apos/>s Channel.

Then, as you are leaving, you open each of the stalls so that the horses will be able to escape once the fire has taken hold. On returning to the alleyway you run to the rear of the armoury building and locate a window through which you can force an entry. It is shuttered and barred, but aided by your innate Kai skills, you are able to break it open. Unfortunately, the noise of your forced entry alerts the two Drakkarim who are on guard inside the building and, as you are squeezing through the narrow window, they attack you with their black-bladed swords.</p>

      <p>As you approach the opening at the base of the tower, your keen senses detect the repulsive aromas of greasy bristles and dung. At once you know that a war-hog pen lies beyond, and you can also detect that it is now empty.</p>
      <p>With weapon drawn you enter the enclosure, searching for a door that will allow you swift entry to the viewing tower above. There is a door, but it is locked and bolted from the other side. Rather than waste precious minutes trying to open this barred portal, you turn to leave. But as you are crossing the straw-strewn floor of the pen, you are brought to a halt when your eye falls upon an oiled leather whip which hangs from a peg on the wall. (If you wish to take this Boar Whip, record it as a Backpack Item on your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>.)</p>
      <p>You leave the pen and rush around the side of the tower in time to see Captain Prarg emerging from the open door. Quickly he descends, sheathing his bloodied sword as he hurries down the steps to meet you.</p>
      <p><quote>That guard<ch.apos/>ll not be raising any alarms,</quote> he says, cocking his thumb behind him towards the tower door. <quote>And they<ch.apos/>ll not be finding him too soon, neither.</quote></p>
      <p>You smile knowingly, and commend your guide for the swiftness of his action. Then Prarg points to an alleyway that lies sandwiched between two burnt-out hovels at the edge of town, and suggests you enter Shugkona that way.</p>
      <p><quote>Lead on, captain,</quote> you say, and follow as he hurries off towards the alley<ch.apos/>s shadowy entrance.</p>

      <p>To your surprise, you discover that the door is unlocked. You push it and it swings open to reveal an empty chamber. You detect a strong presence of evil lurking somewhere nearby and you warn Prarg of what you sense. Cautiously, the two of you leave this chamber by a passage which leads to a flight of black stone steps. You ascend the steps to a domed chamber which is sheathed with dull black stone. Heavy velvet hangings of ebony hue cover most of the walls, and all of the furnishings are upholstered with the same morbid cloth. The sensation of evil is stronger here, so strong that you feel as if you are slowly suffocating.</p>

      <p>Suddenly there is a movement away to your left and a blast of white-hot energy comes roaring towards your face. You dive aside in time to avoid it, but the bolt rebounds from the steel-hard wall and glances off the back of Prarg<ch.apos/>s head, knocking him unconscious.</p>

      <p>Prarg is understandably happy to accept your offer to stand the first watch. While he settles himself down to sleep in the relative comfort of the boat, you pull your cloak about you and climb to the top of Bear Rock where you begin your lonely vigil. For hours you sit on this windswept boulder, staring out through a curtain of swirling snow at the surrounding timber-line. Despite your fatigue you stay alert and your iron discipline pays off when, shortly before midnight, you sense movement at the forest<ch.apos/>s edge. Then your super-keen Kai senses detect an animal scent on the cold air which you recognize immediately: it is Akataz.</p>

      <p>The tracks end at a wooden jetty which juts precariously into the deep, fast-flowing waters of the River Shug. Carefully you examine the ground around this landing area, and aided by your exceptional tracking skills, you make two important discoveries. You deduce that Magnaarn and his troops boarded a barge here and headed downstream towards Darke. Also, you discover that this area was used as a mustering place for a second, far larger unit of troops. Doomwolf droppings and a Giak tooth hint at the identity of these troops, but your suspicions are confirmed when you find a bronze belt buckle which is engraved with the symbol of a fortress and a full moon. It is the symbol of the old Darklord city-fortress of Kagorst. It confirms your fears that Magnaarn has at last persuaded Kagorst to join his cause.</p>

      <p>As the current carries you towards the stone bridge, you row against the river<ch.apos/>s flow in order to slow your final approach to the log barrier. There are Drakkarim on the bridge and the noise of a hard collision would be sure to attract their unwanted attention. The prow grazes the muddy river bank, slowing you further; then the boat comes to an abrupt halt as it bumps against the barrier. Quickly, you leap onto the line of logs and make your way towards the bank as swiftly as the treacherously icy surface will allow.</p>
      <p>A rickety flight of wooden steps ascends from the river to the top of the bridge. You climb them; then you crouch down and take cover behind the stone parapet. From here you observe the town<ch.apos/>s defences and try to assess how many Drakkarim are stationed within this stronghold. The town itself comprises a sorry collection of battle-damaged buildings, ringed by a perimeter wall of logs which is shored up in many places. Several long and bitter battles have been fought here over the past year, and everywhere you look the vivid scars of war are plain to see.</p>
      <p>A rutted road crosses the bridge and leads directly to the town gates. You observe Drakkarim on guard at the bridge, and at the gate, yet you sense something is wrong. The town is strangely quiet and it appears to be weakly protected; the Drakkarim garrison is few in number, and those that you have seen so far appear to be either young, old, or walking wounded.</p>
      <p>Night is beginning to draw in. The Drakkarim are lighting the torches which line the perimeter wall, and a change of guard is taking place at the main gate. A wagon laden with straw crosses the bridge and pulls to a halt nearby. Wearily the driver gets down from his seat, curses his aching back, and then wanders off towards a nearby hovel, one of barely a dozen that are still standing outside the town<ch.apos/>s wall. While he is gone, you take the opportunity to climb into the cart and hide yourself beneath the foul-smelling straw. Soon you hear the driver<ch.apos/>s gruff voice and you feel the cart sway as he climbs back into his seat. There is the <onomatopoeia>crack</onomatopoeia> of a whip and, with a jolt, the cart trundles off towards the main gates.</p>

      <p>You abandon the shelter of the bridge and work your way slowly along the ice-filled ditch to a point directly in front of the tower. Here you settle to observe the Drakkarim guards who are dutifully keeping watch over the eastern approaches to the town. All you can see of them is their brutal faces peering out of the horizontal slit which runs the full circumference of the tower. After a while, three of the four Drakkarim leave the tower by a staircase at the side. Only one remains, and you decide that now would be the best time to make your move, before the three return or before their replacements show up for duty.</p>
      <p>Prarg insists that he go first; he has crossed here once before and he knows a safe way through. The ground looks clear but there are concealed pits out there just waiting to snare the careless or unwary. You nod your agreement and, as soon as the guard turns his face away from the observation slit, Prarg makes his run. Crouching low, he half-runs, half-scampers across the clearing, keeping low and zigzagging as he weaves a safe path through the pits. It takes him thirty seconds to reach the base of the tower; then he slips around the side and takes cover beneath the steps before beckoning you to follow.</p>

You shoulder your Bow and run down the corridor, with Prarg close on your heels, and soon you reach a junction where you are forced to choose a direction, left or right.

      <p>Gradually, over the next few hours, the level of the water rises until it covers most of the surrounding mud flats. Here and there, clumps of wire-hard briar stand isolated on tiny islands which are almost flush with the surface. They are the only features to break the dreary landscape.</p>
      <p>As sunset approaches, so the wind dies until there is barely enough breeze to ruffle the canvas. Stoically Prarg gathers in the mainsail and you ship the oars; then together you pull back against the scum-darkened water and continue on your way. You are watchful of the current, for this will indicate your approach to the River Gourneni, but the water is so thick with silt and slime that neither of you can be certain of its direction, or even of its existence.</p>
      <p>It is almost dark when finally you reach the outflow of the Gourneni. It is a sluggish confluence, jammed with deadwood and silt-banks which obstruct most of its fifty-yard width. You both realize that an attempt to navigate this river at night would be foolish, and so you decide to set up camp at the river<ch.apos/>s edge and wait until first light before continuing.</p>
      <p>Using your Kai skills of detection, you scan the two river banks to determine which would be a safer place to set up camp. Unfortunately you sense little difference between the two; neither east nor west looks very inviting.</p>

      <p>You uncover the sack and sift through its contents. Gleaming in the dim light you see a mass of coins, silver plates and candlesticks, jewellery, and all manner of precious and semi-precious stones. There are countless gold teeth, pulled no doubt from the mouths of fallen Lencian knights, and scores of trinkets and other mementoes taken from less noble corpses. One item you sense possesses magical properties. You pull it out and, on closer inspection, you discover it to be a polished Jadin Amulet which is fixed to a gold neck-chain.</p>
      <p>If you decide to keep this Jadin Amulet, record it on your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a> as a Special Item which you wear around your neck. It adds <ch.plus/>1 to your score should you be instructed to pick a number from the Random Number Table when trying to avoid normal missiles (e.g. arrows, bolts, darts, etc.) aimed at you.</p>
      <p>Having replaced the sack in its hole, you draw your cloak about you and approach the main gates. The guards are busy admitting the latest batch of prisoners and, helped by your camouflage skills, they do not give you a second glance as you stride confidently into the town.</p>
      <p>Once inside, you head towards a dark, deserted alleyway which is sandwiched between a stables and an armoury. From here you observe the compound with a growing anger and pity for those trapped inside. Stirred by their plight, you vow to help these starving men. Patiently you watch and wait for the patrols to pass; then you scurry towards the compound fence to make contact with the Lencians.</p>

      <p>While you are hiding from their search parties, you consider your companion<ch.apos/>s plight and grow ever more fearful for his safety. You are also very anxious that, under torture, he will reveal your identity and the reason why you have come to this town.

      <p><quote>Come, Prarg,</quote> you say urgently. <quote>We must hurry from here. I sense more traps nearby.</quote></p>
      <p>Obediently, the captain follows as you make your way speedily along the passageway towards a distant torchlit chamber. Upon reaching this chamber you are brought skidding to a halt by an unexpected sight.</p>
      <p>The room is constructed entirely of polished black rock. Revealed in the torchlight is a throne of rough-hewn marble, where rests the skeletal remains of a warrior clad in mouldering furs. Bare bone gleams dully through a clinging mass of muscle and sinew, now shrunken to an iron-hard texture, and upon its skull there is perched a helm of solid gold. Set into the face of this helm is an emerald as large as your fist.</p>
      <p>Prarg approaches the throne, tempted by the magnificent emerald, but he halts the moment you warn him that the helm is protected by a magical trap. You sense that a powerful spell of warding encircles the throne; to touch the crown would activate the spell, thereby unleashing a blast of destructive energy. The thought of being blown to atoms serves to dampen Prarg<ch.apos/>s curiosity and sheepishly he returns to your side. You give the booby-trapped throne a wide berth and leave the chamber by a smooth-walled tunnel in the far wall. But you have taken no more than a dozen steps when a chill of premonition runs like a trickle of icy cold water down your spine. You halt and reach for your weapon. Then a loud voice booms out, destroying the silence.</p>
      <p><quote>Welcome, Lone Wolf. Welcome to your tomb!</quote></p>
      <p>Instinctively you know that it is the voice of Warlord Magnaarn.</p>

      <p>Prarg awakens you shortly before dawn. It has been snowing during the night and the boat is covered with a thin layer of crisp white flakes. As you open your eyes, the cold air brings you swiftly to your senses, its sudden unexpected chill making you shiver violently. However, this discomfort is momentary; your Magnakai skill of Nexus rights the imbalance and a comfortable warmth returns to your frozen limbs.</p>
      <p>Carefully you step from beneath the boat and cast your eyes across the marsh which borders the river, now completely white. Tracks in the snow betray the nocturnal passage of several swamp creatures, but none are too large as to cause you undue concern. Prarg unpacks some provisions and, after a breakfast of dried meat, potatoes, ale, and blue cheese, you prepare the boat for your long voyage north up the Gourneni river to Bear Rock.</p>
      <p>By mid-morning the snow has returned and your progress is soon hampered by a whipping wind that blows persistently in your faces. Shielded by your innate skills, the sub-zero temperatures cause you little concern as tirelessly you work the oars. But Prarg is not so fortunate and, as the hours pass, the cold saps his strength until he is unable to continue rowing. Single-handedly you take over the oars whilst your guide, swathed in blankets, mans the rudder and acts as your pilot through the narrower sections of the Gourneni.</p>

      <p>Baron Maquin and Captain Schera are anxious to move their men away from the river bank. Their military training has taught them to avoid placing their troops with their backs to an impassable body of water, for if the enemy were to attack, there would be no way to escape. You understand their concern and, using your ability to magnify your vision, you scan the landscape in search of a more advantageous position. A mile away, to the northwest, you see a tiny hamlet. It appears to be deserted and you suggest to the two officers that they move their men there. Briefly they discuss your suggestion and both agree that it would be a safer position.</p>
      <p>The order to move is passed along the ranks and the men prepare to leave the boats and go forward. You take the lead, together with the Baron and the captain, but you have barely covered a quarter of the distance to the hamlet when your tracking senses warn you that a threat is approaching from the north.</p>

Your camouflage skills keep you from being seen by the Drakkarim sentries and you are able to reach the cover of this shallow, ice-filled trench with little difficulty.

      <p>Fearful of staying a moment longer, you turn around and hurry along the tunnel. Before long you find yourself in a section of this underground labyrinth which has suffered greatly during the recent rockfalls. Many fissures have opened up the stone floor and shattered the walls, but you take these obstacles in your stride and soon arrive at a ruined staircase which ascends to a landing. Here you are confronted by the corpse of a Drakkarim guard. It is slumped beside a mound of rubble which is blocking the stairs to the next level above. A quick examination of the dead body reveals that both arms are broken. Injured and trapped here by the rockfall, it appears that this guard eventually died of thirst.</p>

You count one hundred steps before you arrive at a small chamber which is heaped with rubble.

In both of its huge hands it holds chunks of dagger-like flint which it wields like weapons. Its bloated belly skims the floor as it gathers speed, and a brown gluey saliva runs freely from its fanged lower jaw.</p>

      <p>There is a loud <onomatopoeia>bang</onomatopoeia> and a great grey cloud billows from the muzzle of the musket. It startles the horse, but you swiftly control the animal and urge it forwards, out onto the road. In the confusion you make your escape northwards, hidden from the eyes of your pursuing enemy by the acrid cloud of gunpowder smoke.</p>
      <p>Your ears are ringing but otherwise you and Prarg escape unharmed. The mare is strong and sure-footed, and despite the snow, you quickly cover more than eight miles before you encounter something on the road ahead that brings you immediately to a standstill.</p>

      <p>With weapons drawn you wait for the boat to strike the frost-covered raft of weeds. An unnatural silence has descended upon the surrounding mire, as if every creature of the Hellswamp were holding its breath in anticipation, waiting for the trap to be sprung. The bow grazes the obstruction and suddenly the silence is torn apart by a gurgling screech. Like sorcery-conjured demons, a dozen ghoulish creatures rise up from the murky depths of the swamp amid a seething froth of bubbles. Swiftly they climb from beneath the weed-raft and slink from hiding places along the bank. Within seconds they have you surrounded.</p>

      <p><quote>Ciquali!</quote> growls Prarg, naming these ghoulish foes. He moves forward, sword raised, and lashes out at the first of these dome-headed creatures as it tries to climb aboard. His razor-sharp blade severs its forearm at the wrist, sending a scaly webbed hand spinning into the swamp, trailing green ichor. The beast screams and falls over the side, yet no sooner has it vanished beneath the surface when two more of its kin attempt to haul themselves into the boat.</p>

You rush to help him, approaching as near to the edge of the hole as you dare, and then you see his face pressed to the underside of the ice, close to where you are standing. His eyes are wide open and a stream of bubbles trails from his nose and mouth. You must act quickly if you are to save him.</p>

      <p>With stoic determination you begin the laborious task of clearing away the rock and rubble which fills this stairwell. You are fearful that it may take you several days to reach the next level, and so it comes as a welcome surprise when, after just a few minutes work, you see a gap appearing at the top of the mound. A gust of cold, wintry air wafts through this breach, rekindling your hopes of reaching the surface. Revived by the cold clean air, you attack the rubble with renewed vigour. But then your hopes are shaken when you hear a sinister sound; behind you, something is climbing the stairs to the landing.</p>

      <p>The tip of your lance penetrates the Death Knight<ch.apos/>s armoured breastplate and kills him instantly. The force of the blow is such that it snaps the lance in two and nearly knocks you clean out of your saddle, but you manage to hold tight and quickly you recover. Moments later you reach the platform to see Captain Prarg struggling to break free from his gaolers. He succeeds and he comes running towards you. With a yell he leaps from the platform and lands astride the rump of your horse.</p>
      <p><quote>Go, Lone Wolf, go!</quote> he shouts, excitedly.</p>
      <p>You dig your heels into the horse<ch.apos/>s flanks and take off through the confused mass of Drakkarim towards an avenue on the north side of the square. Prarg<ch.apos/>s hands are still tied behind his back and in order to stop himself from falling off the horse, he is forced to hang on to your cloak with his teeth.</p>
      <p>You gallop out of the square and along the northern avenue which is flanked by barracks and hovels. Arrows come whistling from their windows but they are poorly aimed and fly wide of their mark. You glance over your shoulder and see that some Drakkarim horsemen are grouping up at the exit from the square in order to give chase. You urge the horse onwards, and as you speed towards a distant corner, you use your Magnakai skill of Nexus to loosen Prarg<ch.apos/>s bonds. Minutes later you turn the corner and see the road which leads out of Shugkona. Your spirits rise, but they are quickly dashed when you see that your route of escape is blocked.</p>

Silence returns, and for a long moment you stay alert, suspecting trickery. Then slowly you relax; they have gone.</p>
      <p>Aided by your healing skills, Prarg makes a speedy recovery from the battering he sustained in combat with the Ciquali chieftain. The boat, too, has survived the attack and you are able to continue without further delay.

For several minutes you lie unconscious on the floor of this wind-swept turret, until you are found and revived by your guide and companion, Captain Prarg. Nothing remains of either Warlord Magnaarn or the Nyras Sceptre; both have been utterly destroyed. Prarg helps you to your feet, and as you look out across the battle-torn landscape, you witness a wondrous event. The Gulf of Lencia is dotted with scores of square-rigged men o<ch.apos/> war. They are the ships of the Kasland fleet: at last Lencia<ch.apos/>s allies have arrived.</p>
      <p>Thanks to your bravery and determination, the power which has so devastated this land is now no more. The destruction of the Nyras Sceptre heralds a turning of the tides of war in the west. The Nadziranim and their armies flee the field of battle and are pursued by the allies all the way back to their strongholds in the north. The remnants of Magnaarn<ch.apos/>s army are routed and swept out of Nyras, and after many centuries, this country finally returns to its rightful heirs.</p>
      <p>In recognition of your victory over Warlord Magnaarn, King Sarnac of Lencia and Archduke Chalamis of Kasland hold a royal banquet in Vadera in your honour. You are heaped with praise and you receive the thanks and warm congratulations of a grateful populace.</p>
      <p>Well done, Lone Wolf. Once again you have achieved a victory over the forces of darkness and proved yourself to be worthy of the title <quote>Kai Grand Master</quote>. Yet the fight against Evil goes ever on. On your return to your homeland you will be faced with a new and deadly challenge that will test your remarkable skills and unquestionable bravery.

     <meta><title>Note on Standard Usage</title></meta>

     <data>
      <p>Quite a number of contributors to Project Aon have reported inconsistencies regarding the use of words such as Drakkar across the series. After much research into the usage of Drakkar/Drakkarim, Nadziran/Nadziranim, and Ligan/Liganim across the books, we have decided to standardise the usage of the words in the following ways, which represent majority usage:</p>
       <ul>
        <li>noun (s.): Drakkar</li>
        <li>noun (pl.): Drakkarim</li>
        <li>adj: Drakkarim</li>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       <li>noun (s.): Nadziran</li>
       <li>noun (pl.): Nadziranim</li>
       <li>adj: Nadziranim</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
      <li>noun (s.): Ligan</li>
      <li>noun (pl.): Liganim</li>
      <li>adj: Liganim</li>
     </ul>
     <p>All of the other words ending in -im either already conform to these rules (i.e. gazim, kuzim, lajakim, rekenarim, Sharnazim, and Tefarim) or cannot be conclusively tied to Darkland languages (e.g. Ghagrim).</p>
