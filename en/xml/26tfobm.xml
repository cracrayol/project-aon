     <p>You are a Grand Master of the New Order of the Kai<ch.emdash/>the warrior <ch.eacute/>lite of Sommerlund.</p>

     <p>It is early winter in the year MS<ch.nbsp/>5084, thirty-four years since the First Order of the Kai was massacred by the Darklords of Helgedad. These champions of evil, who were sent by the Dark God Naar to destroy your fertile world of Magnamund, have since been destroyed. Lone Wolf, the supreme leader of your illustrious fighting order, was the only survivor of the Darklord attack upon the Kai. As a young initiate he stood amidst the burning wreckage of the old Kai Monastery and vowed to avenge the slaughter of his comrades. Twenty years later he kept his pledge when alone he infiltrated the foul domain of the Darklords and destroyed the infernal city of Helgedad, the base of their evil power.</p>

     <p>With the destruction of Helgedad, chaos befell the Darkland armies who had, until then, been poised to conquer all Magnamund. Quickly their disorder escalated into a mutinous civil war which allowed the Freeland Alliance armies of Magnamund time enough to recover and launch a successful counter-offensive. Against all odds, a swift and total victory was secured over the feuding armies of evil.</p>

     <p>Following the demise of the Darklords, peace has reigned in your homeland of Sommerlund. Under the direction of Lone Wolf the ruined Monastery of the Kai has been thoroughly rebuilt and restored to its former glory, and a New Order has been firmly established. You are one of this new generation of Kai recruits. You were born in Sommerlund in the year MS<ch.nbsp/>5063, during the time of the war against the Darklords. When you were seven years old you were sent by your father to the Kai Monastery. There, under the tutelage of Lone Wolf, you developed your martial skills and honed the special Kai abilities which lay dormant within you. Over the years that followed, your skills were nurtured and sharpened to perfection by long hours of study and rigorous training. Your exceptional talents have helped you to master all of the Kai and Magnakai Disciplines, and you have risen swiftly through the ranks of the New Order to become one of only five who now hold the high rank of Kai Grand Master. It is an achievement that has brought great honour upon you and your family.</p>

     <p>In the year MS<ch.nbsp/>5077 your skill and courage were put to the test when an attack was launched upon the Kai Monastery during Lone Wolf<ch.apos/>s absence. By means of a Shadow Gate (an astral corridor between the physical world of Sommerlund and the many ethereal domains which lie beyond it), Naar sent forth a host of dragon-creatures to besiege the monastery and lay waste to all Sommerlund. He had chosen his time well, yet his evil plan was thwarted by the tenacious defence that you and your brethren maintained until the siege was raised by Lone Wolf and the King<ch.apos/>s Army of Sommerlund.<footref id="tssf-1" idref="tssf-1-foot"/></p>

     <p>During the seven years that have elapsed since the defeat of his minions, Naar has sought vengeance upon the Kai. He commands many agents of evil upon Magnamund, and quietly they wait in the shadows for the day when they may serve their fell master. One such agent was Lord Vandyan of Eldenora. Guided by Naar, Vandyan sought and found three ancient runes of evil. Empowered by his discoveries, Vandyan summoned a vast army of reptilian warriors<ch.emdash/>the Vorka<ch.emdash/>which he used to conquer and occupy the lands of his peaceful neighbours. Emboldened by his martial successes, Vandyan overran much of central Magnamund, including the realm of Lyris<ch.emdash/>one of Sommerlund<ch.apos/>s oldest allies. In response to a plea for help from Lyris, Lone Wolf mounted a Kai crusade to raise the Vorka siege of Varetta, its capital city.</p>

     <p>During this crusade, you undertook a vital mission behind enemy lines that turned the tide of the whole campaign. Alone, you infiltrated Vandyan<ch.apos/>s daunting fortress of Skull-Tor and destroyed the three runes, thereby extinguishing the source of the power by which the Vorka horde were permitted to exist. Vandyan<ch.apos/>s army dissolved on the battlefield and the Kai were able to raise the siege of Varetta.<footref id="tssf-2" idref="tssf-2-foot"/></p>

     <p>During your mission in Skull-Tor, you discovered that the Vorka were not the only creatures that Vandyan had summoned by the power of the runes. A demonic entity called Zorkaan the Soultaker had also been brought to Magnamund from its lair upon the Plane of Darkness<ch.emdash/>the ethereal domain of Naar. Having fought and defeated this creature, you believed that it had perished forever when subsequently you smashed the runes. Sadly, this was not so. After celebrating the battlefield victory at Varetta, Lone Wolf ordered you to return in triumph to the Kai Monastery aboard the flying ship <cite>Cloud-dancer</cite>. He chose to ride with his New Order crusaders and they were expected to arrive home a week later.</p>

     <p>After five days, a Kai scout arrived unexpectedly at the monastery with shocking news to impart. Lone Wolf had disappeared. Those who witnessed the abduction said that he was engulfed by a whirling black shadow that fell upon him from out of a stormy sky. So swift was the attack that your fellow Grand Masters were unable to prevent him from being carried away. The scout<ch.apos/>s description of the whirling black shadow was identical to the form adopted by Zorkaan the Soultaker. The destruction of the rune used by Vandyan to summon Zorkaan had not brought about the creature<ch.apos/>s demise after all: it had trapped the creature upon Magnamund.</p>

     <p>You had achieved a great victory at Skull-Tor, but the shocking news of Lone Wolf<ch.apos/>s abduction cast a shadow over your triumph there. Hurriedly you summoned Guildmaster Banedon, the leader of Sommerlund<ch.apos/>s Guild of Magicians, to an emergency council at the Kai Monastery. He responded swiftly to your summons and arrived within hours aboard his flying craft <cite>Cloud-dancer</cite>. He was accompanied by Lord Rimoah of Dessi, an Elder Magi magician who is also Lone Wolf<ch.apos/>s oldest friend and advisor.</p>

     <p>Rimoah informed you that Zorkaan<ch.apos/>s arrival upon Magnamund had not gone unnoticed by the Elder Magi. From afar they had sensed the creature<ch.apos/>s presence and, through the use of their Old Kingdom magic, Rimoah and his fellow elders had charted its movements. Rimoah told you of an evil sorcerer called Xaol who was in hiding in Gazad Helkona, a former Darklord city-fortress located in the desolate wastes of northern Skaror. This vile necromancer was a known agent of Naar. During the days before Lone Wolf<ch.apos/>s abduction, Rimoah and the Elder Magi had detected streams of psychic communication coursing between Gazad Helkona and the Plane of Darkness.</p>

     <p><quote>Naar was transmitting to Xaol the secrets of a Ritual of Binding by which the freed spirit of Zorkaan could be enslaved,</quote> said Rimoah. <quote>This ritual was enacted successfully in the stronghold of Gazad Helkona. Through Xaol, Naar has gained control over Zorkaan. He sent this creature to assassinate Lone Wolf, yet the attempt was unsuccessful. Zorkaan failed to kill Lone Wolf<ch.ellips/>but he was able to subdue and kidnap him.</quote></p>

     <p>Rimoah informed you that your leader was being held prisoner in Gazad Helkona. By the use of his Supreme Master Disciplines and the power of the Sommerswerd, his magical blade, Lone Wolf had survived death at the hand of Naar<ch.apos/>s foul creation. <quote>Your leader is brave and resourceful,</quote> he said, <quote>but I fear that Zorkaan<ch.apos/>s frequent attacks will weaken and eventually destroy him unless he is rescued quickly.</quote></p>

     <p>Selflessly you volunteered to attempt the rescue. Rimoah and Banedon, impressed by your courage and your confidence, readily agreed to help you achieve your difficult mission and together you formulated a plan of action. Banedon transported you aboard <cite>Cloud-dancer</cite> to a remote valley south of Gazad Helkona, from where you approached the fortress on foot. Despite great adversity you were able to gain entry to Xaol<ch.apos/>s fortress and save your leader from the clutches of Naar<ch.apos/>s agent.<footref id="tssf-3" idref="tssf-3-foot"/> During your daring mission, you fought and defeated both Xaol and Zorkaan before Banedon arrived to snatch both you and Lone Wolf from the clutches of Xaol<ch.apos/>s angry minions.</p>

     <p>A year has elapsed since your triumph at Gazad Helkona. It has been a peaceful and rewarding time for you at the Kai Monastery, a period in which you have devoted yourself to the training of new recruits. Such has been the success of your tutelage that you have come to be greatly revered by your students and your peers. Yet, lately, you have felt a longing to venture abroad once more, to test your courage and your battle skills in the ineluctable war against Evil.</p>

     <p>Early one morning, you glimpsed a golden eagle leave its nest in the frost-covered timberland that stretches beyond the window of your private chamber. As you watched this majestic creature soar above the tree-line, you were reminded of the daring aerial escape that you had made from Gazad Helkona aboard Banedon<ch.apos/>s skycraft. Then you felt a tingle of premonition at the nape of your neck when you noticed a distant speck in the clear azure sky. This speck grew larger until you were able to discern the distinctive outline of <cite>Cloud-dancer</cite> approaching from the north. Hurriedly you left your chamber and went to the monastery training park where a small group of Kai Lords had gathered in expectation. As the sleek skyship was made to hover overhead, a boarding cage was lowered to the frost-hardened ground and out stepped an unexpected visitor<ch.emdash/>Lord Rimoah of Dessi. You exchanged greetings and he requested an immediate audience with Lone Wolf. From his sombre expression you could tell that he had grave and urgent news to impart.</p>

     <p>You escorted Lord Rimoah personally to Lone Wolf<ch.apos/>s chambers, located beneath the Tower of the Sun, the monastery<ch.apos/>s commanding citadel. Before you could excuse yourself and leave the vault, Lone Wolf asked you to stay to listen to what the venerable magician had come to say. Lord Rimoah nodded his benign approval.</p>

     <p><quote>Dwarf King Ryvin of Bor is in desperate need of our aid, my lords,</quote> began Rimoah, earnestly. <quote>An ancient horror has been awoken in the depths of his subterranean kingdom, and now it threatens to destroy his realm. The Drodarin race may be doomed unless we are able to overcome this creature<ch.ellips/>and swiftly.</quote></p>

     <p>Lord Rimoah informed you that recent excavations in the lowest levels of the vast underground kingdom of Bor had disturbed the Shom<ch.apos/>zaa. This powerful entity was entombed by the Elder Magi during their 1,000-year war against Agarash the Damned<ch.emdash/>Naar<ch.apos/>s first champion of evil. Lone Wolf lowered his eyes and shook his head in disbelief upon hearing Rimoah<ch.apos/>s words.</p>

     <p><quote>I understood that dwarf lore expressly forbade such deep mining, for fear that the Shom<ch.apos/>zaa and its minions might be released. How could such a thing have been allowed to occur?</quote> he said.</p>

     <p><quote>Greed is to blame, my lord,</quote> replied Rimoah, sadly, <quote><ch.lellips/>the greed of King Ryvin<ch.apos/>s elder son, the Crown Prince Leomin. He alone was responsible for the excavations that opened the way to this ancient horror.</quote></p>

     <p>Lord Rimoah informed you that only five days have elapsed since the Shom<ch.apos/>zaa was released, yet already the creature and its Agarashi minions have taken control of the lower levels of the kingdom. <quote>Bitter fighting rages in the tunnels and chambers of Bor as King Ryvin<ch.apos/>s army struggles to contain the Shom<ch.apos/>zaa and its horde,</quote> he said. <quote>They are being sorely pressed, for the enemy have captured their armouries and equipped themselves for the fight. Ryvin has lost control of the tunnels leading to his throne chamber, where Leomin and his younger brother, Prince Torfan, are now trapped and besieged, along with the remnants of their personal guard.</quote></p>

     <p>Lone Wolf was disturbed to hear that the Throne Chamber of Bor was under attack, for it houses the fabled Throne of Andarin. This grand seat contains a gem of power that was bestowed upon the Drodarin dwarves of Bor by the Goddess Ishir. Its divine radiance provides the dwarves with a unique energy that enables them to grow their crops deep underground, without the need for direct sunlight. If the Throne of Andarin is destroyed then the crops will surely fail and famine will beset Bor, with disastrous consequences.</p>

     <p><quote>Repeated attempts to break the siege of the throne chamber have failed, and the morale of Ryvin<ch.apos/>s army is now dangerously low,</quote> said Rimoah. <quote>I<ch.apos/>ve heard tell that even the Dwarf Lords and the War-thanes, the <ch.eacute/>lite of Ryvin<ch.apos/>s army, hold that Prince Leomin<ch.apos/>s greed has sealed their fate. If such talk is true, and the Shom<ch.apos/>zaa conquers Bor, then our hopes for a lasting peace in Magnamund will be ruined. The fall of Bor will give Naar a base of power at the very heart of Magnamund. There he will be able to muster his agents, spawn his vile abominations, and attempt once more to conquer our world.</quote></p>

     <p><quote>But what can be done to save Bor before it is too late?</quote> asked Lone Wolf, anxiously.</p>

     <p><quote>King Ryvin lacks the means to destroy this enemy,</quote> replied Rimoah, gravely. <quote>Nevertheless, the means exist. The Shom<ch.apos/>zaa is especially vulnerable to magic of the Old Kingdom. It is the magic that we used to entrap and entomb the creature millennia ago.</quote></p>

     <p>From a pocket of his flowing robes, Rimoah took out a spherical crystal and held it in the cupped palm of his hand. Its multi-faceted surface radiated beams of golden light which shimmered and sparkled with a supernatural brilliance.</p>

     <p><quote>A Sun-crystal,</quote> said Lone Wolf.</p>

     <p><quote>Yes, my lord,</quote> replied Rimoah, reverently. <quote>By the skilful use of the power contained within this sphere it is possible that we may defeat the Shom<ch.apos/>zaa and its minions, and thereby spare the kingdom of Bor from the tyrannical rule of Naar. We of the Elder Magi have crafted the means to defeat the Shom<ch.apos/>zaa, but in all Magnamund only the Kai have the ability and courage that is needed to take this goodly weapon and use it to its full effect.</quote></p>

     <p>Lone Wolf approached Rimoah and took the Sun-crystal from his outstretched palm. Then he turned to face you.</p>

     <p><quote>We have been called upon to undertake a difficult and dangerous mission, Grand Master,</quote> he said. <quote>You have proven your bravery and skill beyond all doubt, and truly you have earned the right to refuse this quest with honour. Yet I sense that you hunger for the heat of battle and the challenge of the quest, and so I offer this mission to you. Will you venture to Bor and confront the bane that now threatens to destroy our dwarven allies?</quote></p>

     <p><quote>Yes, my lord, I will,</quote> you replied, without a moment<ch.apos/>s hesitation. <quote>For the greater glory of Sommerlund and the Kai, I am proud to accept the quest.</quote></p>

    <data>
     <p>You keep a record of your adventure on the <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
     <p>During the years you have spent in training at the Kai Monastery, you have devoted yourself to further developing your fighting prowess (<typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ>) and physical stamina (<typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ>). Before you begin this <cite>New Order</cite> adventure you need to measure how effective your training has been. To do this take a pencil and, with your eyes closed, point the blunt end of it onto the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a>. If you pick a 0 it counts as zero.</p>
     <p>The first number that you pick from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> in this way represents your <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ>. Add 25 to the number you picked and write the total in the <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> section of your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a> (i.e. if your pencil fell on the number 7 in the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> you would write in a <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> of 32). When you fight, your <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> will be pitted against that of your enemy. A high score in this section is therefore desirable.</p>
     <p>The second number that you pick from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> represents your powers of <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ>. Add 30 to this number and write the total in the <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> section of your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a> (i.e. if your pencil fell on the number 8 on the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> you would have 38 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points).</p>
     <p>If you are wounded in combat you will lose <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points. If at any time your <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points fall to zero or below, you are dead and the adventure is over. Lost <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points can be regained during the course of the adventure, but your number of <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points cannot rise above the number you have when you start an adventure.</p>
     <p>If you have successfully completed previous adventures in the <cite>Lone Wolf New Order</cite> series (Books 21<ch.endash/>25), you can carry your current scores of <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> and <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points over to this adventure.<footref id="gamerulz-1" idref="gamerulz-1-foot"/> You may also carry over any Special Items, Kai Weapon, normal Weapons, and Backpack Items you had in your possession at the end of your last adventure, and these should be entered on your new <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
     <p><strong>Playing Tip:</strong> You may use a 10-sided die instead of the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> if you find it more convenient.</p>

       <p>It has long been the tradition of your <ch.eacute/>lite warrior caste to bestow a new name upon each young novice when they complete their first year<ch.apos/>s training at the Kai Monastery. Kai names are chosen by senior Kai Masters with the aim of reflecting the individual strengths and qualities of each novice.</p>
       <p>You may create your own Kai name for yourself, or you can generate a Kai name at random using the name tables below. To generate a Kai name, pick a number from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> and consult Table A. The name which corresponds to the number you have picked is the first part, or prefix, of your Kai name. Now pick a second number from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> and consult Table B. The name which corresponds to the number you have picked is the second part, or suffix, of your Kai name. Put the prefix and the suffix together and you have your own personal Kai name.</p>

         <p>After years of martial training and study at the Kai Monastery, and by the rigorous practice of the teachings of your illustrious mentor<ch.emdash/>Kai Supreme Master Lone Wolf<ch.emdash/>you have achieved the noble rank of Kai Grand Master Senior.</p>

         <p>Following in the footsteps of Lone Wolf himself, you have vowed that one day you will become totally proficient in all 16 of the New Order Kai Grand Master Disciplines.

         <p>If this is the first <cite>New Order</cite> adventure you have undertaken, then your present rank is that of Kai Grand Master Senior. This means that you have mastered <em>five</em> of the New Order Grand Master Disciplines listed below. It is for you to decide which five Disciplines these are. As all of the New Order Grand Master Disciplines may be of use to you at some point during your mission, pick these five skills with care. The correct use of a New Order Grand Master Discipline at the right time could save your life. When you have chosen your five Disciplines, enter them in the Grand Master Disciplines section of your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>.</p>

         <p>This Discipline enables a New Order Grand Master to manipulate the four basic elements: Earth, Air, Fire, and Water. By drawing upon individual elements that are available, or combinations thereof, he is able to detach, affix, increase, concentrate, intensify, remove, or accelerate this matter to fulfil a specific purpose, e.g. create a wall, hurl a rock, spray sand, remove air, intensify fire. The versatility of this Discipline increases as a New Order Grand Master advances in rank.</p>

         <p>Through mastery of this Discipline a Kai Grand Master of the New Order becomes a multi-talented performer, proficient in the use of any musical instrument. He is able to sing or chant, recite or compose tales of legend, mimic speech or dialect, and stimulate a wide range of emotions among sentient creatures. The effect and power of his bardic abilities will steadily increase as he advances through the Grand Master ranks.</p>

        <data>
         <p>Upon reaching the ultimate rank of Kai Supreme Master, Lone Wolf received as a reward from the God Kai many new skills and abilities. One of these skills was Kai Weaponcraft. Using his newfound mastery, Lone Wolf forged ten weapons of magical power in the armoury furnaces of the Kai Monastery. These magical weapons are reserved for the <ch.eacute/>lite of the New Order Kai who attain the rank of Grand Master.</p>

         <p>In recognition of your rank and achievement, you may choose your own Kai Weapon from the table below or, if you prefer, you can generate one at random. To generate a Kai Weapon, pick a number from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> and consult the first column. The magical Axe, Sword, or Broadsword which corresponds to the number you have picked will be your own personal Kai Weapon. Record this magical weapon and its unique properties in the Kai Weapon section of the <a idref="action">Special Items List</a>.<footref id="equipmnt-1" idref="equipmnt-1-foot"/></p>

         <p><strong>Example</strong></p>
         <p>Say you choose the number 1 from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a>, your Kai Weapon will be the Axe <quote>Alema</quote>.</p>

         <p>When using this Kai Weapon in normal combat you may add <ch.plus/>5 points to your <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ>. Each Kai Weapon has a unique property. When you use your Kai Weapon in combat against the type of enemy that matches its unique property, or use it at the optimum time or location, then you may add the higher bonus to your <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> (these bonuses are not cumulative).</p>

         <p><strong>Example</strong></p>
         <p>If you were to use <quote>Alema</quote> in combat against an undead enemy, you could add the higher bonus of <ch.plus/>7 to your <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ>. If you were to fight a living enemy using this weapon then the bonus to your <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> would remain at <ch.plus/>5.</p>

       <p>At the start of a combat, enter your own and the enemy<ch.apos/>s <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points in the appropriate boxes on the Combat Record section of your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
       <p>The sequence for combat is as follows:</p>
       <ol class="paragraphed">
        <li><p>Add any extra points gained through your Grand Master Disciplines and Special Items to your current <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> total.</p></li>
        <li>
         <p>Subtract the <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> of your enemy from this total. The result is your Combat Ratio. Enter it on the <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
         <p>Example</p>
         <p>You, Grand Master (<typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> 32), are attacked in a forest by a pack of Wild Dogs (<typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> 31). You are taken by surprise and are not given the opportunity of evading their attack. You possess the Grand Master Discipline of Kai-surge to which the Wild Dogs are not immune, so you add 8 points to your <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ>. You also possess the Kai Weapon <quote>Ulnarias</quote>, so you add an additional 5 points to your <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ>. This gives you a total <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> of 45.</p>
         <p>You now subtract the Wild Dogs<ch.apos/> <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> from your own, giving a Combat Ratio of <ch.plus/>14 (45<ch.minus/>31=<ch.plus/>14). <ch.plus/>14 is noted on your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a> as the Combat Ratio.</p>
        </li>
        <li><p><a id="stage3">When you have your Combat Ratio</a>, pick a number from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a>.</p></li>
        <li>
         <p>Turn to the <a idref="crtable">Combat Results Table</a>. Along the top of the chart are shown the Combat Ratio numbers. Find the number that is the same as your Combat Ratio and cross-reference it with the random number that you have picked (the random numbers appear on the side of the chart). You now have the number of <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points lost by both yourself and your enemy in this round of combat. (E represents points lost by the enemy; GM represents points lost by yourself<ch.emdash/>Grand Master.)</p>
         <p>Example</p>
         <p>The Combat Ratio between you and the Wild Dogs has been established as <ch.plus/>14. If the number picked from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> is 1, then the result of the first round of combat is:</p>
         <ul>
          <li>You (GM) lose 3 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points (plus an additional 1 point for using Kai-surge. This loss is in addition to the loss suffered as a result of combat).</li>
          <li>Wild Dogs lose 9 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points.</li>
         </ul>
        </li>
        <li><p>On the <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>, mark the changes in <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points to the participants in the combat.</p></li>
        <li><p>Unless otherwise instructed, or unless you have an option to evade, the next round of combat now starts.</p></li>
        <li><p>Repeat the sequence from <a idref="stage3">Stage 3</a>.</p></li>
       </ol>

       <p>This process of combat continues until the <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points of either your enemy or yourself are reduced to zero or below, at which point that combatant is declared dead. If you are declared dead, the adventure is over. If the enemy is dead, you can proceed but with your <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points possibly reduced.</p>

        <data>
         <p>During your adventure you may be given the chance to evade combat. If you have already engaged in a round of combat and decide to evade, calculate the combat for that round in the usual manner. All points lost by the enemy as a result of that round are ignored, and you make your escape. Only you may lose <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points during that round (such is the risk of turning tail and running away during combat!). You may only evade if the text of the particular section allows you to do so.</p>

          <dt>Animal Mastery</dt>
           <dd><p>Kai Grand Master Superiors who possess this Discipline are able to deter predatory animals in the wild by exuding a scent which is repellent to them. In order for this improved Discipline to work effectively, a Kai Grand Master Superior must be aware of the species of predatory animal he/she wishes to deter. The scent can only be detected by the targeted animal.</p></dd>
          <dt>Assimilance</dt>
           <dd><p>Kai Grand Master Superiors who possess this skill are able to create a noise and project it up to 15 yards away from their location. The noise is akin to the rumbling sound of thunder and it can be used to distract or divert an enemy<ch.apos/>s attention. This improved Discipline requires a degree of preparation and therefore it cannot be used during combat.</p></dd>
          <dt>Astrology</dt>
           <dd><p>Kai Grand Master Superiors who possess this Discipline are skilled in the use of all mechanical devices designed to measure and/or observe the cosmology of Magnamund. Such devices include sextants, astrolabes, and orreries.</p></dd>
          <dt>Herbmastery</dt>
           <dd><p>Kai Grand Master Superiors who have this Discipline are able to purify water, thereby making contaminated or briny water suitable for consumption. Roughly two pints of water per day can be purified using this skill alone. This daily total steadily increases as a Grand Master advances in rank.</p></dd>
          <dt>Elementalism</dt>
           <dd><p>Kai Grand Master Superiors who possess this skill are able to condense pure water out of the surrounding air. This water can be made to fall as a fine spray or as a sudden deluge.

           <dd><p>Kai Grand Sentinels who possess this Discipline are able to detect psychic residues left on an object by its owner.

Pick your initial five Grand Master Disciplines with care for a wise choice will enable anyone to complete the quest, no matter how weak their initial <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> and <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> scores may be. Completion of previous <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> adventures (Books 1<ch.endash/>25) may be advantageous, but it is not essential for the successful completion of this <cite>New Order</cite> adventure.</p>

       <p>Lone Wolf places the Sun-crystal in the palm of your hand, and then he closes your fingers around is multi-faceted surface. At once you sense that the gentle warmth of this artefact belies a tremendous power that is locked within its core. (Record the Sun-crystal on your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a> as a Special Item which you keep in the pocket of your tunic. You must discard another item in its favour if you already possess the maximum number of Special Items permissible.)</p>

       <p><quote>The Sun-crystal will do you no harm, Grand Master. Only Shom<ch.apos/>zaa need have fear of its power,</quote> says Lord Rimoah, reassuringly.</p>
       <p><quote>How is this so?</quote> you ask.</p>
       <p><quote>The energy that permits the demon to exist in our world is drawn directly from the Plane of Darkness,</quote> explains Rimoah. <quote>There is an open channel between the creature and Naar<ch.apos/>s evil domain. It is a slender, ethereal link. This invisible conduit has kept the creature alive during its long entombment, yet soon it may prove to be its undoing, for it is this link to the Plane of Darkness that will trigger the Sun-crystal<ch.apos/>s cleansing powers. The merest touch of the crystal upon Shom<ch.apos/>zaa<ch.apos/>s foul hide will be enough to consign it to oblivion.</quote></p>
       <p>With your briefing now complete, Lone Wolf orders you to return to your chamber to make swift preparations for an immediate voyage to Bor. You collect your equipment and your Kai Weapon, say a hurried farewell to your fellow Grand Masters, and then race to the training park where Lord Rimoah is awaiting you in the boarding cage. Lone Wolf bids you good luck and godspeed as you step inside, and proudly you return his salute as the cage is winched up to the stern deck of <cite>Cloud-dancer</cite>. Rimoah gives the crew the command to depart and, as the great craft gets underway, you stand at the aft rail and watch as the frosted walls and towers of the Kai Monastery swiftly recede into the distance.</p>
       <p>Lord Rimoah invites you to accompany him to the captain<ch.apos/>s quarters where, to your surprise, you discover the cabin is empty; Banedon is not aboard. <quote>The Guildmaster is unable to travel with us,</quote> explains Rimoah, <quote>but he has placed his skyship and crew entirely at our disposal. We owe him a debt of gratitude, for time is against us and there can be no swifter way for us to reach our destination.</quote></p>
       <p>During the fourteen hours that it takes to travel by skycraft to Bor, Lord Rimoah tells you much about the kingdom of the dwarves, their long history, and their proud legends. You also learn that your destination is Boradon, the principal city of Bor, and you are intrigued to discover that in your native language this ancient Drodarin name has a somewhat evocative meaning: <quote>the Mountain of Blood</quote>.</p>

Its swift current takes you through a series of low, dark caverns, and steeply-sloping chutes, until you reach a place where it flows into a deeper, colder channel.

Suddenly, a swarm of large wasp-like insects pour out of this hole and encircle the basket. The lower stripy sections of their bodies begin to glow as they gather together in a cloud and hover menacingly above you.</p>

       <p>The dwarves of Bor are famed throughout Magnamund for their devotion to the technology of warfare. Drodarin engineers have for centuries produced ingenious weapons that utilize the power of explosive powders and inflammable fluids. The distant hall is one of King Ryvin<ch.apos/>s weapons laboratories, and it contains a vast assortment of bombards, siege engines, and other mechanical devices of war. It also contains a host of Shom<ch.apos/>zaa Agarashi who appear to be conducting experiments of their own, with devastatingly lethal results.</p>

       <p>The tunnel shakes with the force of another explosion as you cautiously approach the entrance to the laboratory. Standing atop a wooden platform at the far side of the chamber, you see a thin skeletal creature, with charcoal-black skin and iridescent eyes. Like an orchestral conductor it issues directions to its minions scattered about the hall below. Many are killed carrying out the orders, yet they seem more afraid of incurring the creature<ch.apos/>s wrath than of being blown apart by their inept handling of Drodarin explosives. Below the platform you can see an archway with a stone ramp that descends to a lower level. This exit from the laboratory is protected by a heavy wooden portcullis, yet the gate is raised and the archway is clear. You note that the portcullis is operated by a single rope and pulley.</p>
       <p>Before you attempt to enter the hall, you consult the Bloodstone Andarin and see that the colours have become stronger since the last time you looked. Your Kai senses and the lights of this glowing gemstone both confirm that you are getting nearer to finding King Ryvin<ch.apos/>s sons.</p>

Several cart tracks converge at the approach to a wide stone ramp that ascends to the mouth of an unguarded tunnel in the cavern wall.

       <p>Your eye falls upon a two-wheeled field cannon which stands 20 yards from the portcullis. Its bronze muzzle is fashioned in the likeness of a dragon<ch.apos/>s mouth, with a serpent-like tail that winds back along its barrel to the touch-hole. You magnify your vision and you are able to see that the cannon is primed, loaded, and set ready to fire. If you could reach the cannon and set a light to its touch-hole, it would discharge its shot straight at the portcullis.</p>

       <p>As the rock golem crumbles to dust, you rush to Prince Leomin<ch.apos/>s side and try to revive him with your Magnakai Curing skills. The healing warmth of your powers pass through your hands and into his body, and his eyelids flicker open as his consciousness stirs. (The healing of Leomin<ch.apos/>s wounds costs you 2 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points.)</p>
       <p>When his senses return, firstly he retrieves his battle-axe from the floor, and then he turns to offer you his thanks. Suddenly his eyes widen and he gasps with shock: Shom<ch.apos/>zaa is approaching silently behind you. Leomin grabs you by the tunic and pulls you aside as he raises his battle-axe in readiness to hurl it at Shom<ch.apos/>zaa<ch.apos/>s hideous form. But before he can release the axe, he is felled by a stream of clear fluid intended for you. It strikes his chest and boils as it eats through his crimson breastplate. With a heart-rending scream he collapses to the ground, mortally wounded.</p>

       <p>You wrench the Sun-crystal from your pocket and turn to confront Shom<ch.apos/>zaa, your arm poised ready to throw your deadly device. But already the fell creature has retreated and taken cover among the stalagmites. You run to the stone ramp to scan the cavern, and your Kai Sixth Sense alerts you to his hiding place. His body is hidden, but the top of his ghastly head can be seen protruding above a stalagmite less than 30 feet from where you stand.</p>

       <p>As the icy bolt passes through the wall of hot air, it is transformed into a cloud of harmless water vapour. Your effective use of your Kai Mastery to counter the creature<ch.apos/>s attack shocks the watching minions. Nervously they back away, defying the hysterical shrieking of their cadaverous commander who orders them to attack you <foreign xml:lang="fr">en masse</foreign>. Before they can rally themselves and carry out the order, you steal away into a section of the vast laboratory that is crowded with siege machinery and engines of war. Here you take cover behind a large shield on wheels and observe the Shom<ch.apos/>zaa minions as they mill about in confusion.</p>
       <p>Suddenly their commander recaptures their attention by freezing two luckless minions to death with another icy blast. When he then commands the portcullis to be lowered to prevent your escape, a zealous minion rushes forward and begins hacking at its securing rope with a battle-axe. The rope snaps, and you watch with horror as the portcullis comes crashing down to seal off the exit.</p>

Promptly you step away from the cage as the first of their missiles ricochet off its buckled iron roof.</p>

       <p>The lever clicks down and a secret panel in the wall slides open to reveal a narrow passage. As you are peering along this gloomy tunnel, suddenly the heavy chamber door bursts open and slams against the wall.</p>
       <p>An icy trickle of fear runs down your back when you turn to look upon the squat creature that is now framed in the doorway. It has a bloated, veined body and waxy skin that is as pale as a frozen corpse. From its fanged mouth there flickers a forked tongue, and its scarlet eye-slits radiate an evil light that chills you to the bone. It advances into the chamber with its arms outstretched, as if it is walking in its sleep. Then it turns and points its arms at you, and its clenched fists begin to glow like two balls of red-hot plasma.</p>
       <p>You take hold of the stonework that frames the secret panel and pull yourself towards the narrow passageway. You are only halfway through the opening when two orbs of living flame leap from the creature<ch.apos/>s glowing fists and come arcing towards your spine.</p>

       <p>A cheer erupts to your left as the Shom<ch.apos/>zaa horde falters and falls back in confusion on that flank. Drodarin marksmen hastily reload their muskets and let loose a parting volley to speed them on their way. But as the smoke from their firearms clears, you see that the battle is going against Prince Torfan<ch.apos/>s War-thanes on the right flank of the barricade. The cannon, and Leomin<ch.apos/>s battle-standard, have both been captured by a dozen Shom<ch.apos/>zaa Agarashi. You watch with mounting horror as the enemy turn the captured cannon around and point it at the Throne of Andarin, and your fears are compounded when you sense that the gun is primed, loaded, and set ready to fire.</p>

       <p>For more than a mile you ride the torrid waters of this underground river. Its swift current takes you through a series of low, dark caverns, and steeply-sloping chutes. During one of many rapid descents, your Backpack is torn and you lose one item. (Erase from your Backpack one item of your own choice.)</p>
       <p>Soon you reach a place where the river flows into a deeper, colder channel. Where the two rivers meet, the water boils and seethes as it collides with a line of jagged, razor-edged rocks. Frantically you battle against the converging currents as you are swept inexorably nearer to this treacherous reef.</p>

       <p>Drawing upon your Kai camouflage skills, you enter the chamber and steal around the perimeter of the horde by using the shadows of its rough-hewn circular wall. It is not until you dash across the entrance to the west tunnel that you are seen and the alarm is raised. You fight valiantly, slaying a dozen of the enemy before the Shom<ch.apos/>zaa commanders freeze you into unconsciousness with a volley of icy blasts. Sadly, it is a sleep from which you never awaken.</p>

       <p>You learn that the princes and their bodyguard of War-thanes have held the throne chamber for six days. They have no food or water, and it is only the radiant power of the throne that has sustained them. Prince Leomin knows the precise location of Shom<ch.apos/>zaa<ch.apos/>s lair and he will lead you to it. You agree to go with him while Prince Torfan remains here to command the defence of the throne chamber.</p>
       <p>Leomin takes you to a stone door set flush into the curving marble wall. A grizzled old warrior sits guard at this portal, and clutched in his vein-covered hands is a glowing runestone. Your Kai senses detect that this door is sealed by an Old Kingdom Spell that has prevented Shom<ch.apos/>zaa<ch.apos/>s horde from gaining entry to the chamber by this way. Prince Leomin unsheathes his battle-axe and motions you to draw your Weapon before the door is opened.</p>
       <p><quote>Shom<ch.apos/>zaa abandoned his attempt to batter down this portal two days past,</quote> he says. <quote>But there may be some of his spawn-kind waiting in the corridor outside. Best be on our guard, Kai Lord.</quote></p>
       <p>Leomin nods to the old warrior and he responds by touching the runestone to the door. There is a faint tinkling sound, and then the portal slides open and you follow the prince as he steps through the opening into the darkened passageway beyond. The portal slides shut behind your back with hardly a sound. Instinctively you scan your new surroundings for signs of the enemy, and quickly discover that Leomin was right to be cautious. More than a dozen Shom<ch.apos/>zaa Agarashi have been left here to guard the portal. Only by chance have you chosen a time to leave the chamber when these creatures are asleep.</p>
       <p>Leomin points to the end of the wide corridor, to a place where a circular shaft descends to a lower level. A large basket, suspended by a rope and pulley, hangs above this shaft. The prince beckons you to follow as he tiptoes around the sleeping creatures and approaches the basket. You are halfway along the corridor when suddenly one of the Shom<ch.apos/>zaa Agarashi awakens and shrieks in alarm. You respond by racing towards the distant shaft, but within a matter of seconds, all of the sleeping creatures are on their feet and rushing from all sides to block your escape. You must fight them.</p>

       <p>The Sun-crystal arcs over the top of the stalagmite and glances Shom<ch.apos/>zaa<ch.apos/>s head. Instantly, there is a blinding flash that makes you cover your face with your hands. This searing light is followed almost immediately by a deafening implosion which sucks a whirlwind of air and loose rock into its spinning core. You throw yourself upon Prince Leomin and pin him to the ground as air and slime and debris are sucked from this cavern into the whirling vortex of the implosion.</p>

Suddenly the Shom<ch.apos/>zaa minions are gripped by a blind panic. They rush in every direction, clawing and biting at each other in their frenzy to escape the explosions and flames.

       <p>After a few minutes the minions cease firing and the pit shaft echoes to the sound of their distant, gurgling laughter. Cautiously you move to the middle of the chamber, to where a line of empty ore wagons stand on a sleepered track. This track curves in the centre and exits the chamber through brick-lined tunnels in the north and east walls. Beside the north tunnel exit you see an iron door with a broken lock.</p>
       <p>You unbutton the neck of your tunic and look at the Andarin Bloodstone in the hope it may help you choose the best route to follow. Its amber and crimson halves are glowing a little brighter now, but when you point the gemstone at each tunnel exit in turn, there is no variation. Looking down, you see that there are many tracks in the dusty ground. Some have been made by booted Drodarin feet, but mostly they are the clawed footprints of Shom<ch.apos/>zaa<ch.apos/>s minions. Then you apply your Kai Sixth Sense and you detect danger lurking along both tunnels.</p>

This creature is knocked down by the force of the Arrow, yet it is able to emit a shrill cry of alarm that alerts the other Shom<ch.apos/>zaa minions to your presence in the smelting cavern.</p>
       <p>The dwarves seize their chance to escape from the cage. Before the creature can get to its feet, a hand reaches through the bars and the bolt is pulled. Then the door bursts open and out they pour with a blood-curdling yell. The surviving guard is trampled underfoot as the dwarves rush to the ore wagons and arm themselves with rocks and tools. The torturers abandon their grisly work and come running towards the prison cage with their weapons raised. Suddenly two of these minions appear beside your wagon. Hurriedly you shoulder your Bow and reach for your Kai Weapon as they turn on you and launch a frenzied attack.</p>

It pounds the ground as it comes lumbering towards you, pulverising the surface. Bravely, Prince Leomin raises his axe, and with his battle-cry upon his lips, he lands a flurry of heavy blows upon the creature<ch.apos/>s chest and neck. The rock beast retaliates with a backhanded swipe. It connects with Leomin<ch.apos/>s head and leaves him sprawled upon the floor, unconscious and bleeding.

Its runic symbols tell you that this broad passage leads to the Throne Chamber of Andarin.</p>

Their senses have been restored, and with them comes a blind fear of your deadly sonic skills. You call upon your mastery of Animal Control and command one of them to calm itself. It responds to your mental suggestions, even though its companions turn and flee for their lives. As they crash through the crops that line the southern perimeter of the clearing, you summon the Brozal to approach you. It responds with calm obedience. Deftly you climb onto the creature<ch.apos/>s scaly back and settle yourself in the saddle. Then you turn it towards the east and urge it to enter the tall wheat. Carefully you skirt around the area of blazing crops before heading away to the north.</p>
       <p>The Brozal lopes through the yellow stalks with a swift and easy gait, and you cover ground at a far swifter pace than would be possible on foot. But when you come unexpectedly to a muddy ditch which marks the boundary between the wheat and a neighbouring crop of barley, the Brozal misses its footing. It stumbles badly and you are thrown headlong from the saddle.</p>

       <p>An icy blast from the creature<ch.apos/>s claw collides with your lightning bolt in mid-air and deflects it from the target. Then the creature emits a loud, hellish shriek, and you feel a fiery pain welling up inside your skull as a powerful stream of destructive psychic energy batters your mind. Rapidly the pressure builds in your head until your skull feels fit to burst. Your vision is clouded by a scarlet haze, and you are unable to stifle a cry of pain as you collapse to your knees: lose 3 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points.</p>
       <p>Desperately you struggle to erect a defensive wall around the core of your mind, using your power of Psi-screen. Slowly, as your mental defences lock together, the pain eases and your vision clears. Through the receding red mist you see a group of Shom<ch.apos/>zaa Agarashi closing in on you with their swords drawn. You force yourself to stand, and you unsheathe your Kai Weapon just in time to meet their determined attack.</p>

       <p>The open portal reveals a great stone staircase that descends to a magnificent marble hall. Vast columns brace the sculptured ceiling and tall silvery mirrors line the walls, creating the illusion that this cavernous chamber is even larger. Seated upon a chair in the centre of the echoing hall is King Ryvin, clad in his golden battle-armour and wolfskin cape. Surrounding him are members of his royal family and other high-ranking Drodarin nobility. They are greatly distressed and several are weeping openly. A herald announces your arrival and the crowd parts as you approach the foot of Ryvin<ch.apos/>s chair.</p>

       <p><quote>Praise Ishir!</quote> booms the dwarf king. <quote>We have prayed that you would return to aid us, Lord Rimoah. And I see you bring a Kai champion. We are doubly glad. You<ch.apos/>ve arrived not a moment too soon.</quote></p>
       <p>King Ryvin rises from his chair and motions to you and Rimoah to accompany him into an antechamber. In the privacy of this adjoining room, he tells of the nightmare that has engulfed his kingdom following the release of Shom<ch.apos/>zaa. The creature and its horde of mutant spawn have spread like a voracious plague throughout the chambers and tunnels of his vast subterranean realm. All contact with the Drodarin communities surrounding Boradon has been severed, the lower levels of the kingdom have been lost to the enemy, and more than half of his army are unaccounted for.</p>
       <p><quote>So many have been slain,</quote> he says, his deep voice cracking with emotion. <quote>Only the swift destruction of Shom<ch.apos/>zaa can save us now. But all is not yet lost. I draw strength from the certain knowledge that my sons<ch.emdash/>Leomin and Torfan<ch.emdash/>are still alive, and the Throne of Andarin is intact.</quote></p>
       <p>Suspended upon a chain around his neck is a bloodstone amulet which is divided along its centre. One half of this gemstone glows faintly crimson, the other half pale amber.</p>
       <p><quote>This is the Andarin Bloodstone,</quote> he says. <quote>It contains the crimson light of Leomin and the amber light of Torfan. These lights will remain aglow so long as my sons shall live.</quote></p>
       <p>Then he points to a flowering shrub that stands in a copper urn beside the chamber door. <quote>That Xanthoa is evidence that the throne of my ancestors has not been destroyed, for it would wither in an instant if the throne were sundered. From these signs, and the eternal mercy of Ishir, I draw strength.</quote></p>
       <p>For more than an hour you deliberate how best to defeat Shom<ch.apos/>zaa and save the Throne of Andarin, and finally you agree upon a plan of action that could save this beleaguered realm from total destruction.</p>

       <p>As you descend, you hear a faint buzzing sound resonating from the rock-face. Rapidly this sound becomes an angry drone when the basket draws level with a cavity in the wall. Suddenly, a swarm of large wasp-like insects pour out of this hole and encircle the basket. The lower stripy sections of their bodies begin to glow as they gather together in a cloud and hover menacingly above you.</p>
       <p><quote>Antah wasps!</quote> exclaims Leomin, as he frantically works the rope and drops the basket at a stomach-churning speed. The wasps give chase, but when you call upon your improved Discipline of Pathsmanship and command them to disperse, they return immediately to their nest in the wall of the shaft.</p>
       <p>Prince Leomin is impressed and, for the first time in many days, a smile creases his sullen face. He commends your skill as he slows the rope and lowers the basket gently to the base of the shaft.</p>

       <p>You follow Lord Rimoah out onto the windswept deck and look down in awe at the mighty city of Boradon. Rooted directly in the granite escarpment of Andar, the highest mountain of the Great Bor Range, its fortifications and turrets are barely distinguishable from the rugged copper-red cliffs surrounding them. Night has fallen and the moonless sky is as black as jet, yet the crew of the <cite>Cloud-dancer</cite> have no difficulty in locating the approach to this ancient mountain metropolis. Torches burn in every turret and arrow slit, and blazing beacons illuminate a safe passage through the snow-capped peaks to the city<ch.apos/>s central square.</p>
       <p>A unit of King Ryvin<ch.apos/>s <ch.eacute/>lite War-thanes have been stationed in the main square in anticipation of your arrival. Their captain, a robust-looking dwarf with a plaited beard and a shock of bright red hair, offers you both a hearty welcome when you step from the boarding cage. He says that King Ryvin is waiting and he bids you accompany him without delay. His torch-bearing warriors escort you along a winding path that ends at a stone bridge which arches across a deep, natural moat. Beyond the bridge is a great bronze portal set into the mountainside. A horn sounds as you approach and the huge door swings open to reveal a wondrous sight.</p>

       <p>With Prince Leomin watching your back, you cautiously explore this stinking hive. Beyond the cocoons you come to an adjoining cavern where a rough stone ramp descends to a sunken floor, ankle-deep in brackish slime. Clusters of large grey eggs are attached to conical stalagmites, and the surface of the mire is littered with the remnants of these leathery grey sacs. Your Kai Sixth Sense tells you that these torn egg pouches once contained the creatures that are now wreaking havoc in the dwarven kingdom.</p>

He is a four-legged being, and his great head is triangular in form. Two pale green, radiant eyes are set above a three-cornered mouth filled with crystalline fangs. Below his jaw protrudes a slender proboscis, and from the crown of his bony skull sprout antenna tipped with barbed spikes. Slime drips from his every pore, sheening his leprous hide.</p>
       <p>At first Shom<ch.apos/>zaa appears not to have sensed your presence in his lair. Busily he tends to a batch of Agarashi eggs, injecting them with fluid from his proboscis to encourage them to hatch. But when you remove the Sun-crystal from your pocket and get ready to hurl it at his loathsome form, suddenly he senses danger and retreats among the stalagmites. As he withdraws, he emits a sound that is beyond the range of human hearing.</p>

       <p>You follow the newly-laid wagon track along the tunnel until you are brought to a halt by the sound of enemy activity in a cavern ahead. Cautiously you make your approach, using the cover afforded by pit props which support the roof of this recent excavation. Rows of ore wagons are parked here, each filled with precious korlinium ore. A large group of more than 50 Shom<ch.apos/>zaa Agarashi are standing around them, shrieking and gesticulating at each other. They have no commander to keep them in order, and they have been left in a state of panic and confusion following the destruction of Shom<ch.apos/>zaa.</p>
       <p>Aided by your Kai camouflage skills, you have little difficulty slipping past these creatures and continuing along a tunnel in the opposite wall. This wide passageway brings you back to <quote>The Hub</quote>, but as you approach this familiar cavern, your blood is chilled by the sight of what awaits you there.</p>

       <p>You continue for several miles in complete silence and darkness until you hear a noise faintly in the distance. You stop to concentrate your aural abilities and gradually you are able to identify the distinctive, familiar sounds of battle. The clash of blades, the dull report of Bor pistols, and the dying shrieks of men and monsters can be heard seeping through the cracked walls of this tunnel.</p>
       <p>You press on for a further mile until the tunnel tapers and comes to a dead end. A wedge of lantern-light is pouring through a wide hole near the floor, and when you peer through it, you see a wider tunnel which passes at a right angle to the one you occupy. Lying on the floor of this new passageway are the bloodstained bodies of Drodarin warriors, entwined with Shom<ch.apos/>zaa minions and Agarashi.</p>
       <p>You watch and listen for several minutes. When you are sure that you can detect nothing moving in the tunnel below, you remove your Backpack and push it through the hole. Then you wriggle through this narrow gap and drop down onto the body-strewn floor. You are replacing your Backpack when suddenly your Kai senses alert you to an approaching danger.</p>

From its fanged mouth there flickers a forked tongue, and its scarlet eye-slits radiate an evil light that chills the marrow in your bones. As it advances into the chamber with its arms outstretched, you swallow hard with disbelief when you see that its clenched fists are glowing white-hot. They flare and pulsate, like two great balls of fiery plasma.</p>

       <p>After a few minutes, the shuddering vibrations subside and the deluge of rock abates. Blindly you drag yourself along the ground, through clouds of choking dust. When the dust finally settles, you look back to see that the tunnel has been sealed off completely.</p>
       <p>Fearful that another rockfall could occur at any time, you pull yourself to your feet and press on. You have covered just a few hundred yards when you come to a place where the tunnel turns to the north. Beyond this curve you catch sight of a lantern-lit hall in the far distance. You stop to magnify your vision; then you see that the distant cavern contains the cause of the explosions that have disrupted this section of King Ryvin<ch.apos/>s copper mines.</p>

       <p>Patiently you wait until the Shom<ch.apos/>zaa Agarashi have disappeared from the passage; then you draw your Kai Weapon and steel yourself to enter the hole. Leomin keeps lookout as you duck your head and step through its jagged opening.</p>
       <p>As your eyes adjust to the gloom, you gasp with horror at what you see in the cavern before you. Hanging from the slime-stained ceiling are hundreds of large, grey cocoons. Through the wiry threads that form their fibrous shell cases, you can see the faces and features of Drodarin warriors. Your throat tightens when you realize that their corpses are being kept here to provide future food for Shom<ch.apos/>zaa and his horde.</p>

       <p>The sounds of fighting grow louder as you explore the depths of this tunnel. Frequently you have to hide in the shadows to avoid colliding with ragged groups of wounded Agarashi retreating from battle. But at length you come to a large cavern that serves as the anteroom to the throne chamber of Andarin.</p>
       <p>From the cover of a stone column beside the tunnel exit, you observe the deadly struggle that is taking place in this smoke-filled cavern. Scores of dead Agarashi are heaped before the entrance to the distant throne chamber. Its great double doors have been torn from their hinges, yet entry has been denied to the Shom<ch.apos/>zaa horde. A barricade fills the open doorway, and this makeshift wall is being skilfully defended by the War-thanes of Prince Leomin and Prince Torfan.</p>
       <p>An assault on the throne chamber is about to take place. You watch with grim fascination as the Agarashi rise up from positions they have dug around the perimeter of the cavern, and wait for their commander to shriek the order to attack. A wailing cry echoes around the cavern as the horde rushes headlong towards the barricade. They come to within a few paces of the wall before the leading ranks are obliterated by a cannon<ch.apos/>s shell and a deafening volley of Bor pistols. There is a brief clash of swords and spears, followed by an ominous silence. From out of the smoke and carnage, the few who have survived the attack come crawling back to their trenches to lick their wounds and await the next assault.</p>
       <p>Soon you hear the approach of enemy reinforcements, their ill-fitting armour rattling as they come running along the tunnel. You are forced to move away from the column for fear of being seen when they arrive but, as you scurry to the cover of an empty powder barrel, you are spotted by a group of Shom<ch.apos/>zaa minions in a trench near the cavern wall. They cry out to their comrades, alerting them of your presence as they fumble to load their captured crossbows.</p>

As the smoke clears, the misshapen creatures scurry back to their deadly experiments, urged on by the shrieks of their cadaverous lieutenant. To your dismay, you see that your route to the portcullised archway is no longer clear. It is obstructed by a group of minions that are attempting to dismantle a siege catapult and a two-wheeled field cannon.

       <p>You hear the Brozal slowing as they draw near to the junction, and your skin prickles with a premonition of danger. Your Kai senses detect the approach of a malevolent entity, a creature in their company that is exuding a powerful aura of evil. Fearing that you may be discovered if you stay here, you silently slip away along the passage.</p>
       <p>Soon you arrive at a great bronze door. It is inlaid with ancient Drodarin runes and embellished with gold leaf. Gently you push against its cold surface, and the portal swings open to reveal a gloomy chamber. You sense no threat here and so you enter and then push the door closed behind you.</p>
       <p>The walls of this chamber are lined with alcoves which are filled with ornate burial urns. Some have been smashed, and their powdery contents lie scattered upon the marble floor. You quickly determine that you have entered a Drodarin cinerarium<ch.emdash/>a place where the cremated remains of dwarven warriors are laid to rest. Such chambers are considered sacred by the Drodarin, and it saddens you to see that this one has been wantonly desecrated by Shom<ch.apos/>zaa minions.</p>
       <p>A large tomb dominates the centre of the chamber. Its lid is cracked and holed where the minions have attempted to force an entry. Drodarin script embellishes its dusty surfaces, and when you make a closer inspection, your pulse quickens. This is the tomb of Andarin<ch.emdash/>the first King of Bor. Through a small hole that punctures the tomb<ch.apos/>s lid, you can see part of the king<ch.apos/>s burial urn. It is lit by the supernatural glow of a golden warhammer that rests beside it. Your Kai senses detect that this is a powerful, magical weapon.</p>

You force yourself to stand, and you unsheathe your Kai Weapon just in time to meet their determined attack.</p>

       <p>It was Leomin<ch.apos/>s greed that caused the release of Shom<ch.apos/>zaa and its ravening horde, yet he was a brave warrior nonetheless. His last courageous act saved your life, and for that you will always be grateful. You lay his head gently upon the ground and offer up a prayer to Ishir to watch over his soul. Perhaps, one day, his kinsfolk will forgive and forget his weaknesses and come to honour the memory of this brave warrior prince.</p>
       <p>You resolve to return at once to the Throne Chamber of Andarin. You have completed one vital part of your mission<ch.emdash/>the destruction of Shom<ch.apos/>zaa.

With this aim in mind, you leave Shom<ch.apos/>zaa<ch.apos/>s lair and hurry back to the hole through which you entered the hive.

       <p>The narrow tunnel, along which you first entered the cavern, is silent and empty. By contrast, the wagon-tracked passage leading off to the south now echoes to the sound of anguished cries. They are the shrieks of Shom<ch.apos/>zaa<ch.apos/>s minions. The death of their master has been felt among their ranks, and although they survive for now, they know that without his power they are ultimately doomed.</p>

       <p>The stone ramp leads to a titanic, lantern-lit cavern, where acres of wheat and barley are ripening in fields of fertile soil. You are amazed that such rich arable land can exist so deep below the surface of Magnamund, where rain has never fallen and the sun has never shone. Truly the Goddess Ishir gave the Drodarin a wondrous gift when she bestowed upon them the Throne of Andarin, for its powers alone permit this miracle to exist.</p>
       <p>You leave the ramp and follow a rutted cart track. It borders upon a field of tall wheat, swaying gently in a cooling breeze. As you walk along, you magnify your vision and attempt to judge the distance to the far wall of the cavern. You have just concluded that it lies more than two miles ahead when suddenly you see something in the middle distance that makes you freeze in your tracks. A group of six large, two-footed creatures have emerged from the wheat field. At first glance they remind you of the guanza, the racing lizards bred in the Southlands, but when you take a closer look you see that these grey-skinned mounts are not born of natural stock. Astride their scaly backs sit Shom<ch.apos/>zaa minions armed with spears and lances. The leading rider sights you on the track and immediately the group comes speeding towards you with a loose, loping gait.</p>

       <p>You follow the stocky Drodarin warrior out of the great hall and along a passageway that leads to the entrance of a vast, lantern-lit tunnel. Four large wolves are harnessed to a chariot parked alongside the tunnel wall, and these great grey beasts whine excitedly when they see Vagel appear. The captain leaps into the chariot and beckons you to join him. As soon as you are safely aboard, he grabs the wide leather reins and sets the wolves running.<footref id="sect318-1" idref="sect318-1-foot"/></p>

       <p>Tenaciously you cling to the chariot<ch.apos/>s rail as Vagel hurls his two-wheeled transport through a seemingly endless succession of titanic caverns, and you marvel at the scale and diversity of this subterranean kingdom, for it is far greater than you had ever imagined possible. You see farmsteads with cattle and crops, rivers laden with fish, mines rich with silver and rare minerals, and wells brimming with oil to fuel the great lanterns of this vast underground realm. But among the many wonders of Bor you also see some of the tragedy that has befallen the Drodarin race. Many of the dwellings you pass have been destroyed or abandoned, and groups of battle-weary dwarf warriors sit huddled and dejected in their ruins, nursing their wounds.</p>
       <p>Beyond the smoking shell of a house, you arrive at the entrance to a sloping tunnel that descends to a quarry and copper mine. The site looks abandoned, but when you emerge from the tunnel, your Magnakai Discipline of Pathsmanship screams a warning that you are heading into an ambush. You shout at Vagel to turn the chariot about, but before he can obey your command, a volley of arrows whistle down from the surrounding rocks. One of the wolves is killed instantly, causing the chariot to swerve out of control. Then the left wheel shatters upon hitting a boulder, and in the blink of an eye you are sent tumbling headlong through the air.</p>

       <p>Upon returning to the cavern, you enter the south tunnel and follow the newly-laid wagon track to a junction where a smaller passage leads off to the right. The entrance to this smaller tunnel is blocked by a criss-cross of timbers. An iron sign is fixed to one of the planks, but its Drodarin runescript has been eaten away by acid. When you look closer, you determine that the sign was defaced by Shom<ch.apos/>zaa himself. Traces of the acid are identical to the corrosive fluid that ate through Prince Leomin<ch.apos/>s armour.</p>

       <p>You remain hidden behind the large shield as the enemy come searching for you among the Drodarin war machines. Through a peephole in the shield<ch.apos/>s timbers, you observe the Agarashi commander climbing down from the platform to join in the hunt. It shrieks incessantly at its scurrying minions, and looses off random blasts of icy death as it searches for you like a hungry predator.</p>
       <p>The tunnel by which you entered the hall has been sealed off, and the portcullis can no longer be raised now that its hoisting rope has been severed. Your hopes of escaping are fading fast, until you see something nearby that revives your flagging spirits.</p>

       <p>When you press the last button in the sequence, you hear the locking mechanism disengage and the bronze portal slowly swings open. You hurry through, pausing for a few moments to pull the heavy door shut behind you.</p>
       <p>The tunnel continues and you follow its central wagon track as gently it descends through the ore-rich rock. After several minutes, you detect a noise like distant thunder rumbling in the passageway ahead. You proceed with caution now, and gradually this low, thunderous noise becomes a series of individual bangs. Soon you catch sight of a lantern-lit hall in the far distance. When you stop to magnify your vision, you see at once that it harbours the source of these loud explosions.</p>

       <p>Shom<ch.apos/>zaa clutches at the deep wounds you have inflicted, and he staggers and falls backwards into the slime. You have slain this formidable foe, yet you sense that his death is but a temporary state, for the link between his body and the Plane of Darkness remains intact. Even as you gaze upon his loathsome corpse you detect the flow of an evil reviving power.</p>
       <p>You return to where Prince Leomin lies, and you call upon Ishir to guide your arm as you take the Sun-crystal from your pocket and hurl it at Shom<ch.apos/>zaa<ch.apos/>s body. It strikes him and instantly there is a blinding flash. This searing light is followed by a deafening implosion which sucks a whirlwind of air and loose rock into its spinning core. You throw yourself upon Prince Leomin and pin him to the ground, as air and slime and debris are sucked from this cavern into the whirling vortex of the implosion.</p>

       <p>King Ryvin summons Vagel, the red-haired captain of his Royal War-thanes, and assigns him to be your guide. Vagel knows a way to reach the throne chamber where the princes were last seen together. They and their bodyguards are believed to be trapped in the chamber, stoically defending the precious throne from capture by the horde. Vagel also knows the location of Shom<ch.apos/>zaa<ch.apos/>s lair. The creature is known to return there frequently.</p>
       <p>To help you further, the King gives you the Andarin Bloodstone. (Record this on your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a> as a Special Item which you keep on a chain around your neck. You need not discard another item in its favour if you already possess the maximum number of Special Items permissible.) He informs you that the colours of the amulet will deepen as you draw closer to his sons.</p>
       <p>Lord Rimoah will stay in the great hall and assist King Ryvin in drawing together the remnants of his scattered army. They will then attempt to break through to the lower levels and secure the throne chamber. Having agreed the plan, you bid farewell to Rimoah and get ready to set off at once with the captain. Before you leave the great hall, Vagel offers you the chance to visit the Royal War-thane armoury.</p>

Several cart tracks converge at the approach to a wide stone ramp that ascends to the mouth of an unguarded tunnel in the cavern wall.

       <p>You speak the words of the Brotherhood Spell <spell>Strength</spell> and as it begins to take effect, you feel an invigorating surge of power flowing through every muscle of your body. Electrified by this energy, you take hold of the tomb<ch.apos/>s lid and force it aside.

       <p>With a growing sense of awe, you take hold of the golden warhammer and raise it aloft. You admire its finely-crafted lines and perfect balance, and you sense that it was forged by magical fires.</p>
