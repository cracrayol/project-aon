    <p>You are the warrior, Lone Wolf, last of the Kai Masters of Sommerlund and sole survivor of the massacre that destroyed your kinsmen during a bitter war with your age-old enemies, the Darklords of Helgedad.</p>
    <p>Many centuries have passed since Sun Eagle, the first of your kind, established the Order of the Kai. Aided by the magicians of Dessi, he completed a perilous quest to find seven crystals of power, known as the Lorestones of Nyxator. On discovering them he unlocked a wisdom and strength that lay within both the Lorestones and himself. He recorded the nature of his discoveries and experiences in a great tome entitled The Book of the Magnakai. You have discovered this lost Kai treasure and have given a solemn pledge to restore the Kai to their former glory, ensuring the security of your land in the years to come. However, your diligent study of this ancient book has enabled you to master only three of the ten Magnakai Disciplines. To fulfil your pledge you must complete the quest first undertaken by Sun Eagle over one thousand years ago and find the Lorestones of Nyxator. By doing so, you, too, will acquire the power and wisdom of the Magnakai, which is held within the Lorestones<ch.apos/> crystal forms.</p>
    <p>Already your quest has taken you far from your northern homeland. Following in the footsteps of the first Kai Grand Master, you journeyed to Dessi and sought the help of the Elder Magi, the magicians who aided Sun Eagle on his quest long ago. There you learned that one of the seven Lorestones was still present in their land, hidden deep within the island stronghold known as Kazan-Oud<ch.emdash/>Castle Death. In the years since Sun Eagle first came to Dessi, the fortress of Kazan-Oud had become the abode of a great but evil sorcerer called Zahda. The Elder Magi, realizing the danger of Zahda<ch.apos/>s increasing power, attempted to destroy Kazan-Oud, but they failed. In desperation they constructed a prison of energy around the fortress to prevent Zahda from ever escaping. Steadily, however, his power grew and the people of Dessi lived in fear of the day when he would break free and wreak his vengeance upon them. When you resolved to enter Kazan-Oud to retrieve the Lorestone, the Elder Magi rejoiced, for the success of your quest would bring about the destruction of Zahda and put an end to the bane that had haunted Dessi for hundreds of years.</p>
    <p>You survived the perils of Castle Death and emerged triumphant, achieving that which the Elder Magi had believed to be impossible. During the victory celebrations held in your honour you learned that for centuries the Elder Magi had been expecting your coming. An ancient Dessi legend tells of the birth and rise to greatness of two <foreign xml:lang="x-dessi">koura-tas-kai</foreign><ch.emdash/><quote>sons of the sun</quote>. One was named <foreign xml:lang="x-dessi">Ikar</foreign>, which means <quote>eagle</quote>; the other was called <foreign xml:lang="x-dessi">Skarn</foreign>, which means <quote>wolf</quote>. A prophecy foretold that the <foreign xml:lang="x-dessi">koura-tas-kai</foreign> would come from the north to seek the council of the Elder Magi in order that they might fulfil a great quest. Although separated by several centuries, they would share one spirit, one purpose, and one destiny<ch.emdash/>to triumph over the champions of darkness in an age of great peril.</p>
    <p>At the Temple of Truth in Elzian, the magnificent capital city of Dessi, the Elder Magi prepared you for the next stage of the Magnakai quest. Lord Rimoah, the speaker of the High Council, tutored you in the ancient histories of Magnamund, and you received lessons in lore that you would have learned from the Kai Masters if only they had survived the attack by the murderous Darklords of Helgedad.</p>
    <p>The Lorestone you must find now lies hidden in a temple in the centre of a jungle-swamp known as the Danarg. In ancient times this huge area, once the crater of a massive volcano, was controlled by a powerful lord of evil called Agarash the Damned. The Elder Magi defeated him in a war that lasted one thousand years and, in the wake of his destruction, they turned the Danarg crater into a rich and fertile paradise, the perfect setting for their most sacred place of worship<ch.emdash/>the Temple of Ohrido. The Danarg flourished until a great plague befell the Elder Magi and decimated their race. They were forced to abandon the Danarg and seek refuge in Dessi. Slowly the Danarg was consumed by a creeping mire, which swallowed or poisoned all healthy forms of life. The crater became a sanctuary for a host of evil creatures who thrived in the fetid waters and fought for control of the treacherous shifting mud flats. Many came from the barren hills of Ogia, but many more awoke from lairs deep beneath the crater where they had lain dormant since the defeat of their master, Agarash the Damned, eight thousand years ago.</p>
    <p>Now the time for study has passed and the time for swift action has arrived. Grim news from the west prompts the Elder Magi to cease their counselling and arrange for your immediate passage to the Danarg. In the Darklord city of Helgedad a civil war has raged for five years following your defeat of Haakon, Archlord of the Black City. Now, a new lord sits upon the throne of Helgedad<ch.emdash/>Darklord Gnaag of Mozg<ch.ocirc/>ar.</p>
    <p><quote>The Darklords are united behind their new leader,</quote> reports Lord Rimoah solemnly to his fellow elders of the High Council. <quote>And they are hungry for conquest and revenge. Their strength grows with each passing day. We dare delay no longer.</quote></p>
    <p>Silently the members of the High Council rise from their seats and turn to face you. No sounds reach your ears, yet the words of their blessing fill your mind.</p>
    <p><quote>May the Gods Ishir and Kai protect you on your journey into darkness, <foreign xml:lang="x-dessi">Kor-Skarn</foreign>,</quote> they intone.</p>

   <data>
    <p>You keep a record of your adventure on the <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
    <p>During your training as a Kai Master you have developed fighting prowess<ch.emdash/><typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ><ch.emdash/>and physical stamina<ch.emdash/><typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ>. Before you set off on your adventure you need to measure how effective your training has been. To do this take a pencil and, with your eyes closed, point with the blunt end of it onto the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a>. If you pick 0 it counts as zero.</p>
    <p>The first number that you pick from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> in this way represents your <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ>. Add 10 to the number you picked and write the total in the <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> section of your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a> (i.e. if your pencil fell on the number 4 in the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> you would write in a <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> of 14). When you fight, your <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> will be pitted against that of your enemy. A high score in this section is therefore very desirable.</p>
    <p>The second number that you pick from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> represents your powers of <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ>. Add 20 to this number and write the total in the <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> section of your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a> (i.e. if your pencil fell on the number 6 on the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> you would have 26 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points).</p>
    <p>If you are wounded in combat you will lose <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points. If at any time your <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points fall to zero or below, you are dead and the adventure is over. Lost <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points can be regained during the course of the adventure, but your number of <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points can never rise above the number you started with.</p>
    <p><strong>If you have successfully completed any of the previous adventures in the <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> series</strong>, you can carry your current scores of <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> and <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points over to Book 8. You may also carry over any Weapons and Special Items you have in your possession at the end of your last adventure, and these should be entered on your new <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>. (You are still limited to two Weapons and eight Backpack Items.)</p>
    <p>You may choose one bonus <a idref="discplnz">Magnakai Discipline</a> to add to your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a> for every <cite>Lone Wolf Magnakai</cite> adventure you successfully complete (books 6<ch.endash/>12).</p>

      <p>During your training as a Kai Lord, and in the course of the adventures that led to the discovery of <cite>The Book of the Magnakai</cite>, you have mastered all ten of the basic warrior skills known as the Kai Disciplines.</p>
      <p>After studying <cite>The Book of the Magnakai</cite>, you have also reached the rank of Kai Master Superior, which means that you have learnt <em>three</em> of the Magnakai Disciplines listed below. It is up to you to choose which three skills these are. As all of the Magnakai Disciplines may be of use to you at some point on your adventure, pick your three with care. The correct use of a Magnakai Discipline at the right time can save your life.</p>
      <p>The Magnakai skills are divided into groups, each of which is governed by a separate school of training. These groups are called <quote>Lore-circles</quote>. By mastering all of the Magnakai Disciplines in a particular Lore-circle, you can gain an increase in your <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> and <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points score. (See the section <quote><a idref="lorecrcl">Lore-circles of the Magnakai</a></quote> for details of these bonuses.)</p>
      <p>When you have chosen your three Magnakai Disciplines, enter them in the Magnakai Disciplines section of your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>.</p>

      <section class="frontmatter" id="wpnmstry">
       <meta><title>Weaponmastery</title></meta>
       <data>
        <p>This Magnakai Discipline enables a Kai Master to become proficient in the use of all types of weapon. When you enter combat with a weapon you have mastered, you add 3 points to your <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ>. If you have the Magnakai Discipline of Weaponmastery with Bow, you may add 3 to any number that you choose from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a>, when using the Bow. The rank of Kai Master Superior, with which you begin the Magnakai series, means you are skilled in <em>three</em> of the weapons in the list below.</p>

        <p>The fact that you are skilled with three weapons does not mean that you begin the adventure carrying any of them.

        <p>If you choose this skill, write <quote>Weaponmastery: <ch.plus/>3 <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> points</quote> on your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>, and tick your chosen weapons on the <a idref="action">Weapons List</a>. You cannot carry more than two Weapons.</p>

        <p>It is a powerful Discipline, but it is also a costly one. For every round of combat in which you use Psi-surge, you must deduct 2 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points. A weaker form of Psi-surge called <cite>Mindblast</cite> can be used against an enemy without losing any <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points, but it will add only 2 extra points to your <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ>. (Psi-surge and Mindblast cannot be used simultaneously.) Psi-surge cannot be used if your <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> falls to 6 points or below, and not all of the creatures encountered on your adventure will be affected by it; you will be told if a creature is immune.</p>

     <data>
      <p>Before leaving Dessi on your journey to the Danarg, the Elder Magi give you a <a idref="map">map of the jungle-swamp</a> and its surrounding lands, and a pouch of gold. To find out how much gold is in the pouch, pick a number from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a>. Add 10 to the number you have picked. The total equals the number of Gold Crowns inside the pouch, and you should now enter this number in the <quote>Gold Crowns</quote> section of your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>. If you have successfully completed books 1<ch.endash/>7 of the <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> adventures, you may add this sum to the total sum of Crowns you already possess. You can carry a maximum of only fifty Crowns, but additional Crowns can be left in safekeeping at your Kai Monastery.</p>
      <p>The Elder Magi offer you a choice of equipment to aid you on your perilous mission. You can take five items from the list below, again adding to these, if necessary, any you may already possess. However, remember that you can carry a maximum of two Weapons and eight Backpack Items.</p>

      <p>There will be occasions during your adventure when you have to fight an enemy. The enemy<ch.apos/>s <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> and <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points are given in the text. Lone Wolf<ch.apos/>s aim in the combat is to kill the enemy by reducing his <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points to zero while losing as few <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points as possible himself.</p>
      <p>At the start of a combat, enter Lone Wolf<ch.apos/>s and the enemy<ch.apos/>s <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points in the appropriate boxes on the Combat Record section of your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
      <p>The sequence for combat is as follows:</p>
      <ol class="paragraphed">
       <li><p>Add any extra points gained through your Magnakai Disciplines and Special Items to your current <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> total.</p></li>
       <li>
        <p>Subtract the <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> of your enemy from this total. The result is your Combat Ratio. Enter it on the <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
        <p>Example</p>
        <p>Lone Wolf (<typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> 15) is attacked by a Nightstalker (<typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> 22). He is not given the opportunity to evade combat but must stand and fight as the creature leaps on him. Lone Wolf has the Magnakai Discipline of Psi-surge to which the Nightstalker is not immune, so Lone Wolf adds 4 points to his <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ>, giving a total <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> of 19.</p>
        <p>He subtracts the Nightstalker<ch.apos/>s <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> from his own, giving a Combat Ratio of <ch.minus/>3. (19 <ch.minus/> 22 = <ch.minus/>3). <ch.minus/>3 is noted on the <a idref="action">Action Chart</a> as the Combat Ratio.</p>
       </li>
       <li><p><a id="stage3">When you have your Combat Ratio</a>, pick a number from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a>.</p></li>
       <li>
        <p>Turn to the <a idref="crtable">Combat Results Table</a>. Along the top of the chart are shown the Combat Ratio numbers. Find the number that is the same as your Combat Ratio and cross-reference it with the random number that you have picked (the random numbers appear on the side of the chart). You now have the number of <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points lost by both Lone Wolf and his enemy in this round of combat. (E represents points lost by the enemy; LW represents points lost by Lone Wolf.)</p>
        <p>Example</p>
        <p>The Combat Ratio between Lone Wolf and the Nightstalker has been established as <ch.minus/>3. If the number taken from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> is a 6, then the result of the first round of combat is:</p>
        <ul>
         <li>Lone Wolf loses 3 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points (plus an additional 2 points for using Psi-surge)</li>
         <li>Nightstalker loses 6 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points</li>
        </ul>
       </li>
       <li><p>On the <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>, mark the changes in <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points to the participants in the combat.</p></li>
       <li><p>Unless otherwise instructed, or unless you have an option to evade, the next round of combat now starts.</p></li>
       <li><p>Repeat the sequence from <a idref="stage3">Stage 3</a>.</p></li>
      </ol>
      <p>This process of combat continues until the <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points of either the enemy or Lone Wolf are reduced to zero or below, at which point that combatant is declared dead. If Lone Wolf is dead, the adventure is over. If the enemy is dead, Lone Wolf proceeds but with his <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points possibly reduced.</p>

Only Lone Wolf may lose <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points during that round, but then that is the risk of running away!

      <p>In the years before their massacre, the Kai Masters of Sommerlund devoted themselves to the study of the Magnakai. These skills were divided into four schools of training called <quote>Lore-circles</quote>. By mastering all of the Magnakai Disciplines of a Lore-circle, the Kai Masters developed their fighting prowess (<typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ>), and their physical and mental stamina (<typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ>) to a level far higher than any mortal warrior could otherwise attain.</p>
      <p>Listed below are the four Lore-circles of the Magnakai and the skills that must be mastered in order to complete them.</p>
      <dl>
      <dt>Circle of Fire</dt>
       <dd>Weaponmastery <ch.ampersand/> Huntmastery</dd>

      <dt>Circle of the Spirit</dt>
       <dd>Psi-surge, Psi-screen, Nexus <ch.ampersand/> Divination</dd>
      </dl>
      <p>By completing a Lore-circle, you may add to your <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> and <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> the extra bonus points that are shown below.</p>

      <p>As you rise through the levels of Magnakai training you will find that some of your skills will improve. If you have reached the rank of Primate (four skills) or Tutelary (five skills) you will now benefit from improvements to the following Magnakai Disciplines:</p>

         <dt>Curing</dt>
          <dd>Primates with this skill will have the ability to delay the effect of poisons, including venoms, that they may come into contact with.

    <p>The quest for the Lorestone of Ohrido will be fraught with danger, for the temple in which it lies is situated deep within the Danarg. Make notes as you progress through the story<ch.emdash/>they will be of great help in this and future adventures.</p>
    <p>Many things that you find will help you during your adventure. Some Special Items will be of use in future <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> adventures and others may be red herrings of no real use at all, so be selective in what you decide to keep.</p>
    <p>Choose your three Magnakai Disciplines with care, for a wise choice enables any player to complete the quest, no matter how weak his initial <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> and <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points scores. Successful completion of previous <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> adventures, although an advantage, is not essential for the completion of this Magnakai adventure.</p>

      <p>You leave Elzian under cover of darkness on a trading ship bound for Garthen. It is a trim vessel, lean-prowed and simple in design<ch.emdash/>one of a thousand such ships that sail the chain of land-locked seas and lakes dividing the northern and southern continents of Magnamund. Its passage along this great waterway called the Tentarias is unlikely to invite undue attention, and it is for this reason that the Elder Magi have placed you aboard. The nature of your voyage is secret, but you are not alone, for a guide has been chosen to accompany you on your dangerous mission. His name is Paido, a tall, ebony-skinned Vakeros, who is a master of the art of battle-magic. Among his fellow warriors he is a high-ranking lord, respected and honoured for his bravery and skill on the field of battle. Now, for the mission that lies ahead, he has exchanged his gold and scarlet robes for the clothes of a commoner, a roving adventurer with a sword for hire. It is a disguise you too have adopted to veil your true identity on the long voyage to the land of Talestria, where a rendezvous with royalty awaits you.</p>
      <p>You sail westwards, a benevolent wind filling the triangular sail and skimming the ship across the still, blue waters. The hull seems to slide over the surface of the water rather than cut its way through, and you cannot help but wonder if Paido has conjured some magic to speed your passage. Your first port of call is the city of Talon, where food stocks and fresh water are replenished. Then the voyage continues along the Tentarias to the port of Orello, the last stopping place before your ship-bound journey ends at Garthen<ch.emdash/>crown capital of Talestria.</p>
      <p>It is an hour past midnight when you dock at Varnos Harbour in Garthen, a sprawling network of quays and cracked stone jetties that shelter great fleets of merchants, traders, and dhows. Silently like a shadow, you disembark and follow Paido through the twisting harbour streets, slowly climbing the steep stairs that connect one level of Garthen to the next. Rusty lanterns cast pools of yellow light beneath the timbered balconies, illuminating the stalls of merchants and vendors who will haggle, brag, and barter in the crowded streets till dawn. Paido halts at an iron-shod door and raps the grille with the hilt of his blue-steel sword. A man<ch.apos/>s face appears, stern and handsome, with smooth dark hair and keen, intelligent eyes. A smile of recognition softens his lordly features when he sees Paido. In an instant the door swings open and you are ushered inside.</p>
      <p>The man<ch.apos/>s name is Adamas, Lord Constable of the Royal Citadel, protector and cousin of Queen Evaine of Talestria. For centuries a strong bond of friendship has existed between the royal household and the magicians of Dessi, and when called upon by the Elder Magi to help you in your quest, Queen Evaine pledged her support without hesitation. She has volunteered the services of Lord Adamas, who is to ensure your safe and unhindered passage through Talestria to the borders of the Danarg. At dawn, after snatching a few hours<ch.apos/> sleep, you are taken by coach to the east city wharf, where an empty corn barge is waiting to ferry you up-river. Haulage is provided by eight large ghorkas<ch.emdash/>hairy, ox-like creatures from the plains of Slovia<ch.emdash/>which are harnessed to the barge by chains. They lumber along the cobbled towpath, continually kept in line by the stinging lash of the barge owner<ch.apos/>s zull-hide whip. The next day the barge arrives at a small river village called Lona, where a detachment of Lord Adamas<ch.apos/> cavalry, resplendent in surcoats of scarlet and grey, provide you with horses for the cross-country journey to the fortified city of Phoena.</p>
      <p>Ill news greets you in Phoena, the city of triple towers. Zegron, warlord of Xanar, ruler of the barren highlands of Ogia, has amassed an army of Drakkarim warriors. Three days ago they attacked the border town of Luukos to the north. The Talestrian garrison put up a brave and spirited defence, but they were hopelessly outnumbered by the bloodthirsty Ogian horde that drove through the perimeter walls with battering rams and engines of war. The Drakkarim razed Luukos to the ground, and only a handful of survivors escaped to tell of the dreadful battle.</p>

      <p><quote>The situation is grave,</quote> reports Lord Adamas, on returning from an emergency conclave of his fellow Talestrian knights. <quote>For decades Zegron and his minions have raided our northern territories, but never before with such determination and strength. We must mobilize our army for war, for it is war that Ogia has invited by its unforgivable attack on Luukos. I must return to Garthen to muster my retainers in preparation for battle and inform the Queen of the evil that threatens her realm. I can no longer escort you to the Danarg, though your quest must proceed in spite of all that conspires against it.</quote></p>

      <p>Early next morning Lord Adamas accompanies you and Paido to the main square of Phoena; it is from here that your quest begins. The first leg of your journey to the Danarg will take you north to the town of Tharro which nestles in the fertile uplands of Talestria.

      <p>In the distance you see a pall of dense, black smoke rising into the sky. At its base a fortress wall and a cluster of cottages are feeding the greedy flames. Syada burns. To the north of the doomed town an army of black-clad troops covers the hills. The black wolf-head banners of Ogia sway on long poles, fluttering grimly above the ranks of the merciless horde.</p>
      <p>Along the track a great procession of men, women, and children come towards you, some on horseback, some in carts, and some with bundles of possessions clutched to their soot-blackened chests. They stumble forward in silence, their eyes filled with terror and despair.</p>

      <p>You leap from the saddle, narrowly avoiding being pulled off the tree-bridge. Your horse and the hideous creature both disappear from view, quickly swallowed up by the spray from the waterfall. As you land on the slippery wet wood, Paido<ch.apos/>s horse rears up on its hind legs, its forelegs kicking the air and its eyes rolling madly. He fights to control the animal but it is wild with fear and, with a crack of splintering wood, its hind hoof shears through a rotten branch; it totters on the brink. Paido swings his legs clear and abandons his doomed horse barely seconds before it falls into the watery abyss.</p>

Trost draws his sword and challenges the man, demanding that he state his name and the purpose of his journey. It is a fatal mistake. The man looks up from his book, his grey eyes suddenly aglow with a terrible red fire. Trost screams. His face has become a mass of horrible, erupting boils. As he falls to the floor, Paido strikes, his sword a shimmering lance of blue steel forged by the Elder Magi. His attack is lightning fast, but the necromancer counters his blow on the edge of his blade. Sparks explode, showering the tap-room with glowing fragments. The crowd begins to cheer, but their cheers turn to screams of terror when the necromancer summons a new defence.</p>

By chance his tunic snags on a hidden lever and, as his body slumps over, the lever is pulled to one side.

      <p>Carefully you pull Paido off the platform and raise him into a sitting position, his back against the passage wall. Slowly the platform rises back into the pulpit.

      <p>The cloying smell in the cabin is unbearable and soon forces you to return to the deck to clear your lungs. From there you see the captain walking along the river bank inspecting his team of long-haired ghorkas. Stoically they haul the barge upstream, rarely faltering as they tread the rutted and pot-holed towpath. Beyond the bank lies an incredible array of colourful wild flowers<ch.emdash/>scarlet lankpetal, yellow podlumes, and violet mellowroots of towering proportions. Their perfume soon dispels the lingering odour in the cabin.</p>
      <p>The colourful fields suddenly give way to rolling acres of grassy plain, and gradually the sky grows darker until just a slender streak of light fringes the horizon. It is not long before a roll of thunder echoes across the plain.</p>

      <p>The great doors close with a whisper. You follow Paido along a corridor of gleaming silvery metal that dazzles your eyes to a hall carved from solid crystal. Icicles of diamond hang from its ceiling and reflect in a floor set with mosaics of a thousand shimmering squares.</p>
      <p><quote>Approach the crystal dais, Lone Wolf,</quote> instructs Paido, pointing to a radiant circular plateau of pure quartz.</p>
      <p>But even as his words leave his lips you are already walking towards the plinth, drawn by a strange compulsion. You mount the dais and a flood of golden light pours down from above, bathing you in its warm, cleansing rays. You raise your cupped hands, as if offering up an invisible gift, and a tingling sensation runs the length of your arms and spreads through your body, giving you an incredible sense of well-being. A ball of sparkling light is taking shape in your hands. It condenses into a radiant crystal filled with golden fire: it is the Lorestone of Ohrido.</p>

      <p>Day breaks and the view it brings fills you with awe. Perched on this rocky peak, you can see the sheer vastness of the swamp in all its frightening glory for the first time. Paido activates the starguider and scans the horizon, but even before its tell-tale clicks are heard, your eagle eyes have spotted the glint of the temple<ch.apos/>s korlinium spire. To the west, beyond a sea of sickly green-black vegetation, stands the Temple of Ohrido, imprisoned but unaffected by the swamp.</p>

      <p>A bead of sweat on Paido<ch.apos/>s forehead is the first sign of his recovery. Slowly he stirs to consciousness, waking from a sleep that was so nearly his last. He can remember nothing of the ordeal, and when you tell him what has happened he shakes his head in disbelief. <quote>A Helghast?</quote> he says, incredulously. <quote>How can it be?</quote></p>
      <p><quote>The servants of Darklord Gnaag have infiltrated this monastery,</quote> you reply. <quote>They have kept themselves hidden, but I fear the day is fast approaching when they will rise up and wreak their havoc.

If Talestria falls to Darklord Gnaag before we reach the Danarg, then the quest is lost.</quote> You nod in agreement, and as you cast your eyes along the gloomy passageway, you cannot help but wonder if the quest is already lost. With a shake of your head you dismiss the thought and help Paido to his feet.</p>
      <p>The passage follows a tortuous path that leads eventually to a panelled door. A raised button activates the lock, and the door slides into the wall to reveal a strange room. Domed and hexagonal, its walls are hung with tapestries depicting strange and grotesque creatures. Numerous plinths stand upon the richly carpeted floor, each supporting a large bowl filled to the brim with a silvery liquid. Cautiously you step through the secret portal and into this sumptuous chamber.</p>

      <p>Your sense of time slips away as you trek through the seemingly endless expanse of bleak grey trees. Slowly you become aware that you are on an incline, and as your passage becomes steeper, you notice large outcrops of pitted volcanic rock.</p>
      <p><quote>We<ch.apos/>re approaching the Danarg crater,</quote> says Paido, his quietly spoken words echoing loudly through the eerie forest. Suddenly you recall the words of Lord Rimoah during your period of preparation in Elzian: <quote>The Danarg occupies the crater of an ancient and massive volcano. Once it was a lush jungle of fertile vegetation, but now it is a cancerous wound that poisons all who dwell there<ch.ellips/></quote></p>
      <p>By noon you have climbed to the lip of the crater and begun your descent. Gradually the tall, straight trees of the Mordril Forest thin out giving way to twisted trunks and stunted saplings as the land sinks deeper and deeper. Imperceptibly the forest ends and the swamp begins. The ground is softer, and tall, black rushes appear in clumps around misty pools of stagnant water. From tortured husks of trees hang thorny vines, as tough and as cruel as sharpened steel wire. So thickly are they entwined around some trees that they have strangled them, leaving empty coils where the trunks have rotted away. The stench of decay fills your nostrils in the humid yet cold air.</p>

      <p>You are welcomed by an attractive young woman with long, jet-black hair, woven into a single plait that reaches almost to her waist. She is dressed in a green suede-cloth tunic, similar to your own, and wears soft, calf-skin gloves. In addition to the maps, which she researches and draws herself, she also sells all manner of hunting and scouting equipment. She takes an obvious delight in her work and shows you samples of her maps, which are excellent for their accuracy and attention to detail. You ask her if she has ever prepared a map of the Danarg and she turns strangely silent. Tears begin to fill her dark eyes as she recalls how she and her father once explored beyond the fringes of that fearsome domain. They had planned to map its internal waterways and, if luck was with them, discover the lost temple of the Elder Magi. With sadness she tells of her father<ch.apos/>s death in the jaws of a monster that had stalked them from the moment they had entered the jungle-swamp. She escaped but not unscathed. As she fought to free her father from the mouth of the beast she was badly burned by its caustic saliva. Carefully she removes one of her calf-skin gloves and reveals an injured hand. The sight of the angry red scar tissue fills you with compassion for this brave young woman.</p>

      <p>The building turns out to be a bowyery, stocked with some of the finest archery equipment you have ever seen. Myriad types of arrows, quivers, bracers, wrist and finger guards, bowstrings, and bow cases fill the racks from floor to ceiling. A colourful ringed target hangs on the wall behind the counter, and on it are painted the prices of the goods for sale. You read:</p>

      <p>You may purchase any of the above equipment, using Gold Crowns to pay for the items if you wish (1 Gold Crown = 4 Lune). A Quiver holds a maximum of six arrows, and to carry more than six arrows you will need to purchase an extra Quiver. Bow cases, wrist and finger guards, and bowstrings are all Backpack Items.</p>

      <p>Paido climbs the tree to scan the horizon. He carries with him a starguider, a homing device invented by the Elder Magi to enable their flying ships to navigate in the dark. It is sensitive to the vibrations of korlinium crystals. The spire of the Temple of Ohrido is solid korlinium, and the Elder Magi have set Paido<ch.apos/>s starguider to home in on the vibrations emitted by the spire. By following the direction of these vibrations, you should find the lost temple.</p>
      <p>While Paido is busy adjusting the starguider, you decide to take a closer look at your surroundings.</p>

      <p>The Helghast vents a cry of rage and despair as you strike the blow that seals its doom. It crumples and falls, its flesh transforming into a vile green gas. All that remains is the torn and shredded robe that once concealed its identity.</p>
      <p>Your mind reels at what has just occurred, but you dare not dwell on the fearful implications, for you can make out the sound of feet running down the stairs beyond the locked refectory door. You rush to Paido<ch.apos/>s side and shake him, trying desperately to revive him. He groans, his head lolling from side to side as you drag him to his feet. There is now only one escape route from the refectory<ch.emdash/>the hatch in the wall that leads to the kitchens. You lift Paido across your shoulder and bundle him through the narrow opening. But, before you can pull yourself through, the door slams open and a rush of monks pour into the refectory.</p>

      <p>One of the bowls begins to emit a faint humming sound. The surface of its silvery liquid swirls and glows brighter, casting a phosphorescent light onto the domed ceiling. The sparkling mist slowly clears and a strange image takes shape, condensing and forming into something wholly alien, something that resembles the head of a monstrous fly. Its great multi-faceted eyes stare down at you, gleaming darkly with black fire, like two huge clusters of evil jewels.</p>

Also, set into the back of the chair, is a lever. It activates a portal in the opposite wall.

      <p>Your ears are filled with a loathsome hissing as the bodies of your slain enemies dissolve into the mud. You stare at their smouldering remains, and a cold chill grips your heart as you speculate on why these foul servants of the Darklords came to this sleepy Talestrian hamlet.</p>
      <p>Inside the abbey you discover the grisly answer. Scattered throughout the chambers and corridors are the bodies of dead monks, their lifeless faces frozen in masks of horror. Several have been stripped of their robes, presumably to provide a disguise for their killers.</p>
      <p><quote>Why would the Darklords want to take control of this abbey?</quote> asks Paido, horrified at the sight of such slaughter.</p>
      <p><quote>I fear it is part of their plan to conquer Talestria,</quote> you reply. <quote>It is always their strategy to infiltrate a land with agents before invading. When invasion is launched, these agents rise up and attack from within.</quote></p>
      <p><quote>So you think that the Darklords plan to invade Talestria,</quote> says Paido, aghast at the possibility of such an event.</p>
      <p><quote>I suspect that their plan is already under way,</quote> you say thoughtfully. <quote>Perhaps the destruction of Luukos was masterminded not in Xanar, but in Helgedad.</quote></p>
      <p>Paido helps you to bury the monks in the graves already dug by their killers. As you cover the last of the bodies with soil you notice a small, pear-shaped stone lying on the pathway. Its speckled blue surface is mirror-smooth and, despite its size, it feels remarkably heavy. You suspect it is very valuable and decide to keep it. (Mark this Lodestone<footref id="sect202-1" idref="sect202-1-foot"/> on your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a> as a Special Item that you carry in your Belt Pouch.

      <p>The creature gives a strange snickering cry as slowly it edges nearer and nearer. It is a huge, pear-shaped beast with a hunched back and a white lizard-like head. Awkwardly it shuffles upright, on two large hairy paws. At first glance it looks as if two totally separate creatures have been joined together at the waist: the lower half is covered with a coarse, spiky fur, and the upper body is pale and hairless, heavily veined, with long sinewy forearms. It raises its snout to savour the smell of your frightened horse and opens its fanged jaws.</p>

      <p>The bargee hands you a tankard filled to the brim with Chai-cheer. Its greenish hue does little to inspire your confidence, but your doubts soon dissolve when you taste the beverage<ch.emdash/>it is delicious. Paido raises his tankard and takes a great mouthful of the ale of his choice<ch.emdash/>Ferina Nog. Immediately he spits it out, wiping away its insipid taste on the back of his hand. <quote>Bilge juice!</quote> he splutters, slamming down his mug.</p>
      <p><quote>You should be a sight more careful where you empty your mouth, stranger,</quote> growls a man to your right. He bends down and picks up his polished steel helmet. With a slow and deliberate twist of his wrist he empties it of ale, pouring the contents all over Paido<ch.apos/>s feet. Your companion curses and reaches instinctively for his sword.</p>

      <p>The sword whistles past your head and gouges a chunk of stone from the courtyard arch. You hear the monks shouting and you dig in your heels, steering your horse through the archway and along a narrow street that leads to the quadrangle. At this early hour there are few obstacles to slow your escape as you gallop headlong through the twisting streets of Tharro. It is not until you reach the town<ch.apos/>s north gate that you finally rein in your horse to a halt.</p>

      <p>It is late afternoon when you see the Temple of Ohrido, rising majestically out of the swamp mists and tangled vegetation. The sight of this towering ziggurat is so breathtaking that you are both stunned into silence as you feast your eyes on its untarnished splendour. Tier upon tier of gleaming white stone, shaped and formed into perfect symmetry, confront you. Huge foundation slabs support a level carved of golden rock, inlaid and decorated with gemstones. Above that sit strata of precious metals and then levels made up of crystal slabs, whose facets refract the colours of the rainbow. Upward climb tiers of ruby, sapphire, and emerald, that offer up a wedge-shaped spire of pure korlinium crystal to the sky.</p>
      <p>At its base the swamp has shrunk back as if repelled by the radiant goodness of the temple. A perimeter of lush grass leads to a staircase of solid amber. You follow Paido as he ascends towards a pair of huge triangular doors set into the second level. Everywhere the glitter of gemstones and the gleam of precious metals radiate a purity unspoiled by the Danarg. Paido completes the complex procedures that open the great doors, taught to him by the Elder Magi in preparation for this mission. They part and you enter, stepping on a floor of glistening gold, a floor that has lain undisturbed for seven thousand years.</p>

      <p>You spend a cold, wet, and thoroughly miserable night on the plain south of Tharro. A fresh storm rolls in from the west making it impossible to light a fire or dry your already damp clothing. It is dawn when the rain finally eases off, but the storm gives way to a biting wind that chills you to the bone (lose 3 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points). You must now eat a Meal or lose an additional 3 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points.</p>
      <p>The garrison of Tharro still refuses to allow you into the town, so you are forced to set off towards a line of distant hills that fill the northern horizon. Grey-brown grasses brush your shins as you cross this wild, uncultivated plain, encroaching on the deserted track that leads to the frontier town of Syada. An eerie, unnatural silence accompanies your ride, broken only by the rare cawing of ravens, circling high overhead.</p>
      <p>By midday you are deep among the hills. The terrain becomes increasingly rocky, undulating like a storm-tossed ocean. The tall plains grass has given way to sad little plants, scraggy and deformed, stunted by the winds that sweep down from the barren wastes of Ogia. The track passes through a narrow valley, where a small stone cabin stands beside the entrance to a disused mine. As you approach you see a face at the cabin window.</p>

It is solid korlinium. At the centre of the chamber, its hull resting on a cradle of steel, is a Levitron<ch.emdash/>an ancient skyship. Like everything else that you have seen in this wondrous temple, the craft is untarnished by time. Paido ushers you aboard and prepares to power the craft. A shudder runs through the hull as the engines rise in pitch and slowly it lifts from its bed of steel. The chamber is built in the spire of the temple and the roof now slides open to allow the Levitron to rise into the darkening sky above the Danarg.</p>
      <p>Paido sets the controls and sets the ship<ch.apos/>s starguider on a course for Elzian. Then he joins you at the bow-rail for one last look at the Temple of Ohrido. It glows red in the light of the setting sun, but the shimmering glow is blemished by shadows that swoop back and forth across its tiers. You assume it is just a trick of the twilight, until your ears are filled by a sudden and terrifying shriek.</p>

It flows alongside a white-brick house, turning its waterwheel with a comforting, regular sound. As you ride past the house and over a tiny, hump-backed bridge, a cluster of cottages and an abbey come into view. In the grounds of the abbey a burial is taking place. A circle of monks dressed in hooded brown robes are lowering a coffin into one of several freshly dug graves.</p>

A ramshackle building is perched precariously on the edge of the river bank, and an old wooden jetty juts out from the side, its empty platform almost submerged by the swollen river. Two plains farmers disembark here. You hear them talking excitedly about the events they have witnessed, their voices gradually fading as the barge moves forward again.</p>

It would be easy to lose yourself in this maze of tunnels, but your Kai tracking skills, heightened by the pressing need to escape from the monastery, help you avoid the hazards and dead ends of these sprawling burial vaults. Following the sound of dripping water, you discover a circular stone trapdoor in the ceiling. Paido cups his hands around your foot and lifts you nearer the tunnel roof, enabling you to open the trapdoor. Early morning daylight streams into the passage as you lift the slab of wet stone and slide it aside.</p>
      <p>You have emerged at the courtyard on the north side of the monastery. Two monks stand guard at the double doors of a low, timber-framed building on the other side of the paved enclosure. Fortunately a line of bushy fruit trees that encircles the courtyard provide all the cover you need to avoid their watchful eyes. You crouch in the shadows and watch as the monks leave their posts to enter the building. Minutes later the doors swing open and they reappear, both on horseback, and ride off through an archway to the right. The courtyard is now empty but you curse their departure, for the horses they are riding belong to you and Paido.</p>

      <p>Paido screams for your help. A swooping Kraan-rider has cast a large net, smothering his body. The net is sewn with hundreds of tiny barbed hooks which have worked their way into his skin and clothes, and he cannot free himself without the hooks inflicting fearful wounds. Only one Vordak remains to confront him, all the others having perished on his blade, but he is now unable to defend himself against this creature. He is at the mercy of a merciless foe.</p>
      <p>You scramble to your feet and rush to save him as the Vordak creeps closer. Suddenly the Kraan-rider reappears, gliding low across the deck before hovering over the bow. A length of thin black rope dangles from its saddle and hurriedly the Vordak threads it through the corners of the net. You race up the steps, shouting <quote>For Sommerlund</quote> and launch your attack. The Vordak turns to face you, its skeletal features frozen in a mask of terror. An instant later your weapon shears its bony neck and sends its skull-like head spinning down into the Danarg. A ghastly cry pierces your ears, but it is not a shriek of pain or despair: it is a malicious caw of triumph. The Kraan beats its massive wings, and the down-draught forces you to your knees as the creature climbs higher into the darkening sky. You stare aghast as the rope closes the net around Paido and lifts him off the deck. Instinctively you leap upwards, your hands outstretched to grab the barbed net, but it is too late. The Kraan turns in mid-air and flies off to the north with Paido, wounded and helpless, swinging like a netted fish below its leathery black belly.</p>

There a barge is ready to leave for Tharro; its team of ghorkas are harnessed and the crew are preparing to cast off the thick rope hawsers securing the barge to the quay.</p>
      <p>The captain sees you approach and calls to his men, <quote>Hold fast, lads! Looks like we<ch.apos/>ve two more for Tharro.</quote></p>
      <p>A gangplank is lowered and the crew guide your horses aboard. As you dismount the captain strides along the bleached wood deck and greets you like an old friend, shaking both of you warmly by the hand. <quote>Lord Adamas sent word to expect two riders for this trip, though I<ch.apos/>d almost given up waiting for you to show. He<ch.apos/>s paid your fares and he said you may be wantin<ch.apos/> some privacy, so I<ch.apos/>ve set aside a cabin at the stern. My lads will see to your horses.</quote></p>
      <p>The captain points to the rear of the barge where two sets of stairs descend below the deck. <quote>Take the stairs on your left; your cabin is the door at the end of the gangway. If you be wantin<ch.apos/> some food or ale, there<ch.apos/>s a tap-room in the hold<ch.emdash/>just take the stairs on the right.</quote></p>

They stop and sniff the air, whining like hungry pups, frustrated and confused by their conflicting senses. You change your command and will them to attack their masters.

The leading monks throw up their hands in horror and fall against those behind as the dogs leap on them, biting and clawing at their throats. This unexpected attack throws the monks into a panic.

      <p>As you reach the recess beneath the pulpit, you are transfixed by a blinding flash. A searing pain rips through your chest and a deafening <onomatopoeia>bang</onomatopoeia> rings in your ears. Three monks, armed with Bor muskets, have lain in wait in case you reappeared. It seems that their wait was not in vain.</p>
      <deadend>Your life and your quest end here.</deadend>

      <p>You empty the tankard in one go and wipe the froth from your lips. Seconds later the floor of the hold begins to rock from side to side, gently at first, but gathering momentum until you are forced to cling to the table to prevent yourself from falling over. The other passengers seem unaffected by the violent pitching and rolling, as if their feet were nailed to the deck. You shout a warning that the barge is about to sink, that they should try to save themselves before it is too late. They cackle and sneer at your concern for their safety, their faces growing larger and more grotesque and the sound of their laughter building to a deafening crescendo. A man in a red coat looms before you, his face twisted and deformed. He grabs your shoulders and you feel his fingers sink painlessly into your flesh. Recoiling in horror, you draw a hand weapon to defend yourself from this frightening apparition. As you step forward to strike a blow, a wave of giddiness robs you of all balance and you crash headlong to the floor.</p>

Expertly, you manage to steer them down a steep bank of loose shale, and then on at a brisk pace along a dried-out gully. Soon the gully becomes a stream of sparkling water, fed by an underground spring. A rumble, like the sound of a distant storm, warns you that the vast army of Zegron, Warchief of Ogia, is now less than twenty miles away.</p>

      <p>The portcullis finally clanks open and you leave the town, riding the broken dirt track towards the distant hills and the frontier town of Syada. Grey-brown grasses brush your shins as you cross this wild, uncultivated plain. Accompanying your ride is an unnatural silence which is broken only occasionally by the cawing of ravens circling like vultures overhead.</p>
      <p>By midday you are among the hills. The terrain becomes increasingly rocky, undulating like a storm-tossed ocean. The tall plains grass has given way to sad little plants, scraggy and deformed, stunted by the winds that sweep down from the barren wastes of Ogia. The track passes through a narrow valley where a small stone cabin stands beside the entrance to a disused mine shaft. As you approach the cabin you see a face at the window.</p>

      <p>You take a bottle from the rack, crack it open against the wall, and tip the potion into the remaining wine. Carefully you tilt back Paido<ch.apos/>s head and pour the mixture into his open mouth, a drop at a time: in his comatose state he is unable to cough and it would be easy to fill his lungs by accident. It is a slow and painstaking process, which takes you hours to complete.</p>

      <p>Anger and frustration well up inside you as helplessly you watch the Kraan and your captured companion disappear beyond the horizon. Gradually your anger gives way to sadness as you ponder his fate and wonder if he will ever survive this cruel abduction. You pray for his safety, calling on the spirits of your ancestors to watch over and protect him and, as if in answer to your prayer, you feel a sudden calm engulf your senses. The power of the Lorestone, transfused into your being the instant it appeared in your hands, has greatly increased your intellect and awareness. With confidence you know that Paido will survive his ordeal and that one day you will meet and fight again, side by side.</p>
      <p>The return voyage to Dessi is a swift but lonely journey. The starguider ensures that the Levitron stays on course for Elzian and as you cross the canal which encircles the city, a pilot skyship arrives to escort you down. During the voyage you have discovered how to control the Levitron, and now, as slowly you approach the landing platform of the Tower of Truth, you disengage the starguider and make a faultless landing. Lord Rimoah and the High Council have gathered to greet your return, and upon hearing of your successful quest their hopes for the future are renewed in spite of the sad news of Lord Paido<ch.apos/>s capture by agents of the Darklords.</p>
      <p>The High Council listens avidly as you recall your treacherous journey through Talestria, the perilous trek across the Danarg, and the wondrous discovery of their lost temple. When finally you have completed your account they applaud and pay tribute to your courage and daring, their faces beaming with pride. But, despite their joyous greeting, you sense that something is wrong; they seem distant, as if their minds were preoccupied with the solving of a difficult and perplexing problem.</p>
      <p>You ask Lord Rimoah if all is well, and he replies: <quote>You have grown in perception, Lone Wolf. Many things have occurred since last we spoke, and although your quest for the Lorestone of Ohrido has succeeded, the peril of our age has grown ever more deadly. The Darklords now wage open war throughout Magnamund, and many lands have fallen before their Giak legions. Talestria has been overrun. So too have the Stornland nations. Sommerlund stands firm against the armies of Darklord Gnaag, but she has lost her southern province of Ruanon.</quote></p>
      <p>This shocking news fills you with an urge to return to your homeland, yet to do so would defeat the Magnakai quest.</p>
      <p>Lord Rimoah bids you follow him to the chamber of the High Council. Set into the floor is a circular well, brimming with a silvery liquid metal. Rimoah kneels and touches the surface and slowly a vision takes form within the shimmering depths of the pool: it is a fortified city surrounded by rolling hills. <quote>You look upon the city of Tahou in the land of Anari,</quote> says Rimoah, his voice now solemn and composed. <quote>The Lorestone you must find next lies deep below its streets, in an ancient city that was built during the dawn of Magnamund.</quote></p>
      <p>The vision of Tahou heralds the start of a new and perilous episode in your quest for the Magnakai. If you possess the bravery and courage of a true Kai Master, the challenge of Tahou awaits you in Book 9 of the <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> series entitled:</p>

     <meta><title>Note on Standard Usage</title></meta>

     <data>
      <p>Quite a number of contributors to Project Aon have reported inconsistencies regarding the use of words such as Drakkar across the series. After much research into the usage of Drakkar/Drakkarim, Nadziran/Nadziranim, and Ligan/Liganim across the books, we have decided to standardise the usage of the words in the following ways, which represent majority usage:</p>
       <ul>
        <li>noun (s.): Drakkar</li>
        <li>noun (pl.): Drakkarim</li>
        <li>adj: Drakkarim</li>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       <li>noun (s.): Nadziran</li>
       <li>noun (pl.): Nadziranim</li>
       <li>adj: Nadziranim</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
      <li>noun (s.): Ligan</li>
      <li>noun (pl.): Liganim</li>
      <li>adj: Liganim</li>
     </ul>
     <p>All of the other words ending in -im either already conform to these rules (i.e. gazim, kuzim, lajakim, rekenarim, Sharnazim, and Tefarim) or cannot be conclusively tied to Darkland languages (e.g. Ghagrim).</p>
