A transmitter hidden on the island, fitted with a time-delay mechanism, clicks on, sending its high-frequency radio signal to a communications satellite orbiting the earth. This signal is amplified and returned to earth where, simultaneously, it triggers the remaining nuclear warheads. The initial explosions set off a disastrous chain reaction that feeds on civil and military nuclear installations all across the northern hemisphere.

    <p>You are Cal Phoenix, a survivor, born in California on Thanksgiving Day in the year AD 2000. In 2012, whilst on winter vacation at your Uncle Jonas<ch.apos/> and Aunt Betty-Ann<ch.apos/>s ranch in Texas, you were invited to visit a shale-oil mine near Austin; it was the first of its kind in Texas. As Chief of Construction, your uncle was proud to take you on a guided tour of the whole underground complex, which, for security reasons, was totally self-supporting. It was during this tour on 3 January 2012 that the holocaust began.</p>
    <p>You remember how the ground shuddered when the shock waves from the first distant explosions reached the mine, and how you thought it was the start of an earthquake, the like of which you had experienced many times at home in California. But, as the levels nearest the surface began to collapse and the central elevator shaft filled with rubble, you realized the awful truth. At first there was no way of telling the extent of the surface devastation. Below ground, the safety generators had automatically switched into operation when the main power supply failed, and the tremors had faded quickly, which encouraged your aunt and uncle to believe that the damage above was superficial. Uncle Jonas was confident that the military would mount a rescue operation and that you would be brought out within a few days, a week at the most. Aunt Betty-Ann, too, was optimistic. After all, there were emergency supplies<ch.emdash/>enough to feed 200 men for a whole month. Little did she know that the three of you would end up consuming all those supplies, or that the mine would become your home, your shelter, and your prison for the next eight years of your lives.</p>
    <p>It was early September in the year 2019 when eventually you broke through to the surface. When you set eyes on the landscape surrounding the mine, it was like looking at the surface of another planet. Few structures had survived the blizzards and intense cold that had swept around the world in the years following <quote>The Day</quote>, and now, after the dust had settled and the sun had returned, the once-fertile plains of Austin resembled little more than a desert of parched and broken rock, littered with the artefacts of an absent civilization. During the first few days, when you began to explore this wilderness, it was easy to believe that you were the only survivors. But on the morning of the fifth day Uncle Jonas made chance radio contact with a family called Ewell, who were living near the ruins of McKinney, thirty miles north of Dallas. They told him that they had been in touch with a handful of other groups who had managed somehow to survive the holocaust. Most were isolated and unable to move due to lack of fuel, food, or water. They were urging those who could travel to join them in McKinney to start a new community there, and some were already on their way. When your uncle and aunt accepted their invitation, the Ewells were enthusiastic but they also warned you to be wary<ch.emdash/>not everyone who had survived wanted to establish a new community. The ruins of some large Texan cities, such as Dallas and Fort Worth, were controlled by gangs of criminals who fought with each other and terrorized anyone seeking to reestablish law and order. They urged you to avoid these gangs at all costs.</p>
    <p>It took more than a week to discover a vehicle that could transport you to McKinney. It was an old school bus, which had been parked in an underground lot and had survived the years of sub-zero blizzards. With fuel and spares salvaged from the mine, you managed to coax it back to life; then you set off on your journey north. When you arrived at the town, it was easy to find where the Ewells lived, as their ranch was the only place that was still standing. It looked more like an old frontier post than a ranch, with its fortified perimeter wall, lookout posts, and stake-filled moat. Having been ambushed and shot at by the city gangs of Fort Worth during the final stages of your journey, you recognized the need for such defences.</p>
    <p><quote>Pop</quote> Ewell, the seventy-year-old grandfather of the Ewell family, was the leader of this small colony of survivors, and it was he who had urged Uncle Jonas to join them when they had first made radio contact. The colony numbered less than a dozen at the time of your arrival, yet as the airwaves became clearer and new contacts were made, this number had soon more than doubled to twenty-five. It was decided that a name was needed to identify the settlement and <quote>Dallas Colony One</quote> was adopted, <quote>DC1</quote> for short. From that day on, everyone worked hard to make DC1 a secure haven for those seeking refuge from the hostile wastelands and marauding city gangs.</p>
    <p><quote>Cutter</quote> Jacks was one such refugee. Before <quote>The Day</quote> he had been chief mechanic at the International Grand Prix Circuit near Lake Dallas, and his incredible skill and knowledge of engines was soon to prove invaluable to the colony. He taught you how to drive, and from a pile of old wrecks that you helped him salvage from the circuit, he built you a powerful, customized car. You used it to patrol the highways north of the city, keeping a lookout for gangs of city punks who frequently mounted raids to steal or destroy DC1<ch.apos/>s supplies. Cutter also taught you to shoot, and it was your natural prowess with a gun and your skill behind the wheel that were to earn you the begrudging respect of your enemies, who took to calling you the <quote>Freeway Warrior</quote>.</p>

    <p>Six months after you arrived at DC1, the colony was faced with a major crisis. A heat wave was causing a drought that threatened to destroy the food supply. Crops were failing and the colony<ch.apos/>s artesian well, its only source of uncontaminated water, was beginning to dry up. The drought was also provoking more attacks from the city punks, who were desperate for food and water. Their common need had united them and now they posed a very real threat to the security of DC1. It was the last day of May 2020, when Pop Ewell made radio contact with another colony, who were based in the city of Big Spring, 300 miles west of McKinney. Their situation was completely the reverse of DC1<ch.apos/>s: they had food and water in plentiful supply but they were desperately short of fuel. They told of their contact with survivors in Tucson, Arizona, who were also without fuel. The Tucson colony reported that the territories west of the mountains of the Sierra Nevada had been spared the worst effects of the radioactive blizzards that had devastated the rest of the country and, miraculously, much of southern California was still widely populated: it had survived the last eight years virtually intact. When you heard the news you could hardly believe your ears. Perhaps your family were still alive. After all that had happened, there was now a real hope that one day you might be reunited with them.</p>
    <p>A meeting was held to decide how best to deal with the crisis facing DC1. Everyone agreed that to stay at McKinney would lead to eventual death, either slowly from starvation or suddenly at the hands of the murderous city gangs. The only choice open to DC1 was to try to reach California; only there lay real hope for the future of the colony. The decision was relayed to the survivors at Big Spring and a deal was struck to rendezvous with them as soon as possible. DC1 would give them fuel in exchange for food and water, and together they would join up with the Tucson colony for the final stage of the journey to California.</p>
    <p>Careful preparations were made for the long trek, and three vehicles were chosen to make up the convoy: the school bus, your customized roadster, and a gasolene tanker laden with 5000 gallons of petroleum siphoned from underground storage tanks at the Ewell ranch. Supplies of food and water were adequate but the colony lacked sufficient firearms and ammunition with which to defend itself. On the day before the convoy was due to leave, one of the colonists was sent north to search the town of Sherman for weapons. He radioed back to say that he had found a cache of hunting rifles and ammunition, but that his truck had broken down and he was stranded in the town. He had also found a survivor<ch.emdash/>a beautiful teenage girl<ch.emdash/>and he requested that you go to Sherman to pick them up. As soon as you arrived you were ambushed by the scouts of a brutal gang of bikers known as the Detroit Lions and, in the ensuing gun battle, you killed Stinger<ch.emdash/>the scouts<ch.apos/> leader.</p>
    <p>Later you learned that the girl<ch.emdash/>Kate Norton<ch.emdash/>was the sole survivor of a Kansas City colony, which had been attacked and wiped out by the Detroit Lions. The Lions<ch.apos/> leader, who calls himself <quote>Mad Dog Michigan</quote>, had taken a liking to her and spared her life. Mad Dog was once a high-ranking HAVOC agent who had escaped from Pontiac Deep Pen near Detroit, and he and his gang, most of whom were also HAVOC escapees, were heading for the Fort Hood Military Reserve near Killeen, Texas, the largest armoury in the whole of the United States. There he hoped to find enough weapons to equip the other HAVOC clans who were now in control of cities all along the eastern seaboard. Kate had managed to steal a motorcycle and escape from their camp, but Mad Dog was determined to get her back. He sent his brother<ch.emdash/>Stinger<ch.emdash/>and a handful of his best scouts to track her down, and they had finally caught up with her at Sherman.</p>

    <p>When Mad Dog learned that you had killed his brother, he vowed to get even with you at any price. He abandoned his plans to loot Fort Hood and embarked instead on a relentless pursuit of your colony as it crossed the sun-scorched wastelands of Texas. The journey to Big Spring was fraught with great danger, and yet, in spite of the many perils you faced, or perhaps because of them, you felt yourself falling in love with Kate. Moreover you sensed that she was becoming increasingly fond of you. Sadly, the convoy was only a few miles from Big Spring when disaster struck. The land surrounding the settlement was controlled by a gang of bikers, a renegade clan called the <quote>Mavericks</quote> who had been the bane of the Big Spring colony for many months. As the convoy drew nearer to its destination, the Mavericks launched an attack, and, in the running battle that ensued, they captured and abducted Kate. The convoy entered the fortified gates of Big Spring to a rapturous welcome from the colonists of that settlement, but for you the mood of celebration was soured by the vivid memory of Kate<ch.apos/>s abduction. You vowed to rescue her, and from that moment on, every waking minute of every day at Big Spring was spent thinking about little else.</p>
    <p>By chance it transpired that the leader of the Mavericks, a blond-haired murderer called Amex Gold, was a former HAVOC agent who had served under Mad Dog Michigan before <quote>The Day</quote>. He offered to join forces with the Lions, and, as a gesture of his loyalty to his former commander, he returned Kate to him. Together the Lions and the Mavericks launched a hasty attack on Big Spring, yet, although they outnumbered the colony by more than three to one, they were unable to breach the settlement<ch.apos/>s fortified perimeter wall, and were repelled with heavy losses. On the day after the attack, Pop Ewell discovered the radio frequency that the clansmen were using and was able to eavesdrop on their communications. He learned that Mad Dog had ordered another HAVOC clan<ch.emdash/>the Saints<ch.emdash/>who were based in New Orleans, to come to reinforce his command; they were expected to arrive within the week. He also overheard Mad Dog arrange a meeting with Mekong Mike, the leader of the Angelinos, a gang who controlled the city of San Angelo. He wanted him as an ally and was prepared to offer guns and ammunition in return for his help in destroying the Big Spring colony. Two days later, Mad Dog Michigan set off for San Angelo at the head of a motorcycle pack 200 riders strong. Those few clansmen who remained with Amex Gold tried all manner of tricks to convince the colony that the Mavericks and the Lions still surrounded Big Spring in strength, but to no avail. The senior members of the newly-enlarged colony convened a meeting at which it was decided that, with the clansmen now at their weakest, and with the appearance of the New Orleans gang expected at any time, a breakout had to be attempted without delay. There was only one way for the colony to reach Tucson overland and that was to follow the remains of Interstate Freeway 10 through the arid, mountainous territory of western Texas. Precisely halfway between Big Spring and Tucson is the city of El Paso. To reach this city in one piece became the convoy<ch.apos/>s goal, for it lay at the end of a long and tortuous stretch of mountain highway, undoubtedly one of the toughest you would have to face on your journey to California.</p>
    <p>Under cover of darkness, the convoy escaped from Big Spring and sped westwards, now your vow to rescue Kate could at last be attempted and, at the first opportunity, you told the colony of your plans. Reluctantly they let you leave the convoy and go to San Angelo, where you intended to infiltrate the meeting between the Lions and Angelinos in the hope of finding Kate there. Your skill and daring were rewarded: you were able to locate and rescue Kate from under the very noses of the clan leaders. During your escape from their city you killed Mekong Mike, the Angelinos<ch.apos/> leader, and stole a map from Mad Dog Michigan. Later you discovered that this map contained vital details of a HAVOC operation to take over the whole of the United States.</p>
    <p>As you escaped westwards from San Angelo, you encountered three soldiers, survivors from a World Defence League outpost in southern Texas, who were also heading for El Paso where the remnants of their command group were stationed. You joined them and together you made a rendezvous with the convoy at the entrance to the only passable road through the Apache Mountains. A fierce battle was raging along this pass, between the Mavericks and a renegade clan of Mexicans, who had crossed the border in search of food and supplies. The convoy was forced to run the gauntlet of their gunfire before finally reaching its goal. Upon entering the city, you received a warm welcome from the WDL command group who were defending the military reserve of Fort Bliss. They celebrated your arrival for several days until the victorious mood was soured by the appearance of Mad Dog Michigan and an army of clansmen over 1,000 strong. He had persuaded the Mexicans to join the Lions, the Mavericks, and the Saints, all of whom were now united to his cause. The situation was desperate. Faced by overwhelming odds the WDL command tried to negotiate with Mad Dog but he rejected their attempts with disdain. He sent a reply to the command leader, Captain Frankland, in which he reaffirmed his vow to avenge his brother<ch.apos/>s death. His aims were brutally simple: he promised that neither you, nor any of the colony, would ever leave El Paso alive. He set up headquarters in Ciudad Juarez, on the Mexican side of the Rio Grande, from which he directed his clan army to encircle and lay siege to the colony.</p>

    <p>For two weeks, he launched repeated attacks calculated to weaken your defences. The colony withstood the assaults, but this constant attrition began to erode your hopes of ever being able to break out of El Paso and reach Tucson intact. Then a radio message was intercepted that was to turn the desperate situation into a crisis. A clan convoy of trucks was leaving Zaragoza bound for Mad Dog<ch.apos/>s headquarters in Ciudad Juarez. On board were enough high explosives to blow Fort Bliss and everyone in it to sightless atoms. Something had to be done to prevent Mad Dog from using these explosives. Out of desperation was born a daring plan to save the lives of the colony and disrupt the enemy just long enough for you all to break out of El Paso.</p>

    <p>The plan is to destroy the explosives as soon as they reach Ciudad Juarez to prevent Mad Dog Michigan from using them against the colony. It is a dangerous and potentially suicidal mission, too difficult for one man alone, so Captain Frankland offers to lead the mission and calls for three volunteers to accompany him. WDL Sergeant Haskell and WDL Marine Knott accept the challenge, but no one else steps forward readily to fill the remaining place. The future of the colony hinges on the success of this mission, and with this thought paramount in your mind, you summon up the courage to volunteer as the fourth member of the team.</p>

    <p>Before embarking on your adventure, you must first determine your personal characteristics and the weapons and provisions with which you are equipped. An <a idref="action">Action Chart</a> has been supplied on which to record and amend these details as the adventure unfolds.</p>
    <p>Your personal characteristics comprise two basic attributes: <typ class="attribute">CLOSE COMBAT SKILL</typ> and <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ>. To discover your initial <typ class="attribute">CLOSE COMBAT SKILL</typ>, take a pencil and, with your eyes closed, point the blunt end of it onto the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a>. If you pick a 0 it counts as zero. Add 10 to the number you have picked and write the total in the <typ class="attribute">CLOSE COMBAT SKILL</typ> section of your Action Chart (for example, if your pencil falls on the number 5 in the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a>, you have a <typ class="attribute">CLOSE COMBAT SKILL</typ> total of 15). When you fight an enemy in hand-to-hand combat, your <typ class="attribute">CLOSE COMBAT SKILL</typ> will be measured against that of your enemy, so a high score in this section is desirable.</p>
    <p>To discover your <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> level, repeat the process, but this time add 20 to the number you have picked from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a>. Write the total in the <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> section of your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a> (for example, if your pencil falls on the number 8 on the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a>, you have a total <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> score of 28). If you are wounded in combat, or injured at any other time during your adventure, you will lose <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points. If, at any time, your <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points total falls to zero or below, you are dead and the adventure is over. You can regain lost <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points during the course of the adventure, but your <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> level can never rise above your initial score.</p>

      <p>Your ability in each of these five individual skills is measured in skill points. You begin with 3 points per skill. Before starting the adventure, you may allocate an additional 4 skill points to your list of five Survival Skills. These 4 extra points can be used to improve one or more of your five skills. During your adventure, all five skills will be severely tested; therefore the higher the individual skill level, the better your chances of survival. You may allocate your 4 additional points entirely how you like.</p>
      <p>When you have decided where to allocate your 4 additional skill points, make a note of the totals in the Survival Skills section of your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
      <p>(If this is your first <cite>Freeway Warrior</cite> adventure, your total number of skill points should be 19: five skills x 3 points each = 15, plus 4 additional skill points = 19 points.)</p>
      <p>If you complete successfully the mission set in Book 3 of the <cite>Freeway Warrior</cite> series, you may add an additional 4 points to your Survival Skills in Book 4. These additional points, together with any equipment and provisions that you possess at the end of Book 3, may then be used in the next <cite>Freeway Warrior</cite> adventure, which is called: <bookref series="fw" book="04cc"><cite>California Countdown</cite></bookref>.</p>

        <p>For convenience, these medical supplies are grouped into units. To find how many units you have in your Medi-kit, pick a number from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> (0 equals 10) and add 2.

       <p>It is reasonably clear that the Machine Pistol should not be used if you have fewer than 6 rounds of 9mm ammunition.</p>
       <p>For some readers, however, it may seem counterintuitive to have ammunition left but be unable to use the weapon. We suggest to these readers that when 9mm ammunition falls below 6 rounds, the Machine Pistol can be treated as a Pistol (cf. <bookref series="fw" book="01hh" section="sect333">Section 333 of <cite>Highway Holocaust</cite></bookref>).

        <p>In order to be able to use a missile weapon, you must have sufficient ammunition of the correct calibre.

      <p>There will be occasions when you will have to fight an enemy in hand-to-hand combat. The enemy<ch.apos/>s <typ class="attribute">CLOSE COMBAT SKILL</typ> and <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> level will both be given in the text. Your aim in close combat is to kill the enemy by reducing his <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points to zero or below while losing as few of your own <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points as possible.</p>
      <p>At the start of a close combat, enter both your own and your enemy<ch.apos/>s <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points in the appropriate boxes on the Close Combat Record section of your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>. The sequence for close combat is as follows:</p>
      <ol class="paragraphed">
       <li><p>Add any extra points gained through the use of close combat weapons to your current <typ class="attribute">CLOSE COMBAT SKILL</typ> total.</p></li>
       <li>
        <p>Subtract the <typ class="attribute">CLOSE COMBAT SKILL</typ> of your enemy from this total. The result is your Combat Ratio. Enter it on the <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
        <p>
         <line>Example</line>
         <line>Cal Phoenix (<typ class="attribute">CLOSE COMBAT SKILL</typ> 17) is attacked by a Renegade Clansman (<typ class="attribute">CLOSE COMBAT SKILL</typ> 18). He is not given the opportunity to evade close combat, but must stand and fight his adversary. Cal Phoenix is armed with a Hunting Knife, so he adds 2 points to his <typ class="attribute">CLOSE COMBAT SKILL</typ>, giving a total <typ class="attribute">CLOSE COMBAT SKILL</typ> of 19.</line></p>
        <p>He subtracts the Renegade Clansman<ch.apos/>s <typ class="attribute">CLOSE COMBAT SKILL</typ> from his own, giving a Combat Ratio of <ch.plus/>1 (19 <ch.minus/> 18 = <ch.plus/>1). He notes this <ch.plus/>1 on his <a idref="action">Action Chart</a> as the Combat Ratio.</p>
       </li>
       <li><p>After working out your Combat Ratio, pick a number from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a>.</p></li>
       <li>
        <p>Turn to the <a idref="crtable">Close Combat Results Table</a>. Along the top of the chart are the Combat Ratio numbers. Find the number that is the same as your Combat Ratio and cross-reference it with the number that you have picked (the random numbers appear down the side of the chart). You now have the <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points lost by both Cal Phoenix and his enemy in this round of close combat. (E represents points lost by the enemy; CP represents points lost by Cal Phoenix.)</p>
        <p>
         <line>Example</line>
         <line>The Combat Ratio between Cal Phoenix and the Renegade Clansman has been established as <ch.plus/>1. If the number picked from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> is a 4, then the result of the first round of close combat is:</line></p>
        <ul>
         <li>Cal Phoenix loses 3 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points.</li>
         <li>Renegade Clansman loses 4 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points.</li>
        </ul>
       </li>
       <li><p>On the <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>, mark the changes in <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points to the participants in the close combat.</p></li>
       <li><p>Unless otherwise instructed, or unless you have an option to evade, start the next round of close combat.</p></li>
       <li><p>Repeat the sequence from stage 3.</p></li>
      </ol>
      <p>This procedure continues until the <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points of either the enemy or Cal Phoenix are reduced to zero or below, at which point that combatant is declared dead. If Cal Phoenix is dead, the adventure is over. If the enemy is dead, Cal Phoenix proceeds but with his <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points possibly reduced.</p>
      <p>A <a idref="crsumary">Summary of the Close Combat Rules</a> appears on the page after the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a>.</p>

        <p>During your adventure you may be given the chance to evade close combat. If you have already engaged in a round of close combat and decide to evade, calculate the combat for that round in the usual manner. All <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points lost by the enemy as a result of that round are ignored; only Cal Phoenix may lose <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points during that round, but that is the risk of running away!

      <p>Your decision to join Captain Frankland<ch.apos/>s group provokes a mixed reaction among the original members of Dallas Colony One. They put on a brave face and applaud your courage, outwardly proud that one of their number will be part of his team, but they cannot mask their fear for you, not knowing what awaits you beyond the perimeter wall of the Fort Bliss stronghold.</p>
      <p>Using maps and equipment salvaged from the military reservation and adjoining airport, Captain Frankland and Sergeant Haskell formulate a plan of action. At midnight, the team will leave the stronghold and attempt to slip unseen through the surrounding enemy cordon. After that the El Paso city ruins should provide enough cover for you to avoid the clan patrols as you make your way south towards the Rio Grande, where only one bridge across the river still stands<ch.emdash/>the Stanton Street Toll Bridge. The approaches are known to be guarded but the bridge itself is rarely occupied. The plan is to cross the river by this bridge, using a service walkway that runs directly beneath its central span.</p>
      <p>On the Mexican side of the bridge lies Ciudad Juarez, the sprawling, derelict shanty town where Mad Dog Michigan (in deference to Santiago<ch.emdash/>the Mexican clan leader) has based his operations. The convoy of explosives is due to arrive there at two o<ch.apos/>clock tomorrow morning. The team must locate and destroy the trucks and their deadly cargoes as quickly as possible, using contact mines. The resulting explosions are sure to cause panic among the clansmen surrounding Fort Bliss. They will also provide a clear signal to the colony, who will, by then, be ready to exploit the confusion and break through the cordon. Once clear, they are to follow Interstate 10, firstly north towards Las Cruces, and then west towards your intended destination<ch.emdash/>the city of Tucson.</p>
      <p>For you, the real danger begins as soon as the mission is accomplished. Once the explosives have been destroyed, the team must hijack a clan vehicle and escape from Ciudad Juarez as best it can. If all goes to plan, you will rejoin the colony at the New Mexican town of Deming, 100 miles northwest of El Paso, at noon the following day. If the team fails to make this rendezvous the colony will continue regardless.</p>
      <p>The few hours before midnight pass quickly. The colony uses the cover of darkness to prepare their vehicles for the breakout. Kate will be driving your roadster, and you use this as an excuse to spend what little time there is left before the mission with her, supposedly briefing her on the quirks and idiosyncrasies of the car. Everyone is aware that she already knows everything there is to know about your car but no one is insensitive enough to make any comment.</p>
      <p>At five minutes to midnight, Captain Frankland calls you to join the team. <quote>You take good care of my car, y<ch.apos/>hear,</quote> you whisper, as reluctantly you free yourself from Kate<ch.apos/>s tender embrace.</p>
      <p><quote>Only if you promise to take good care of yourself,</quote> she replies, her voice wavering as she tries to control the fear that is simultaneously tightening her throat and churning her stomach.</p>
      <p><quote>Don<ch.apos/>t worry, Kate. I<ch.apos/>ve got a feeling that everything<ch.apos/>s gonna work out just fine. You<ch.apos/>ll see. Tomorrow we<ch.apos/>ll be together again in Deming.</quote></p>

      <p><quote>Get down!</quote> shouts Captain Frankland, as the bullets rip through the thin canvas covering and ricochet off the rear of the driver<ch.apos/>s cab. Instantly you flatten yourself to the floor, which leaps and shudders against your cheek as the truck rams into the west gate. The rot-infested doors offer little resistance: they are wrenched from their hinges and sent spinning through the air to disintegrate on landing.</p>
      <p>More shots are fired but none seem to find their target. You risk a glance over the tailgate to see the race track receding into the distance. In the street outside the track, a handful of determined Angelino clansmen are kick-starting their motorcycles in readiness to pursue you. You know just how dangerous these bikers can be, so you raise your gun and rest its barrel on the tailgate, waiting for the clansmen to come within range.</p>

      <p>A bright yellow bulldozer with its earth scoop lowered is trundling along the main street on a head-on collision course with the truck. The shock of this unexpected attack makes Knott panic. He slams his foot on the brake, bringing the truck to a grinding halt. There is a moment of dead silence when the engine stalls; then the peace is shattered as Captain Frankland screams at Knott to start the engine and get the truck out of the path of the oncoming bulldozer.</p>

      <p>The impending collision has distracted your attention from the rear of the truck, but you are quick to react when Haskell yells for your help. Two Mexican clansmen are scrambling over the tailgate. Quickly they fall upon the sergeant, preventing you from opening fire for fear of hitting him. They fight like maniacs, and, amid a flurry of kicks and punches, your weapon is wrenched from your grasp and you are knocked to the floor.</p>

      <p>The bullet whistles past your left ear, close enough for you to feel the draught. The proximity of the shot spurs you to greater effort and, with a sudden burst of speed, you sprint the remaining few yards across the plateau and along a trail into the trees beyond.

      <p>The moment you break cover, you hear another shot and feel something hot and sharp graze the top of your head: lose 2 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points. The awful suddenness and accuracy of the sniper<ch.apos/>s shot makes you think twice. You abandon your attempt to spot him and seek once more the safety of the truck<ch.apos/>s steel skin.</p>
      <p>Out of the corner of your eye you see the captain cock his machine pistol and get ready to open fire. <quote>OK, I<ch.apos/>m gonna see if I can flush this Yankee out,</quote> he says vehemently, clearly unimpressed by how near you came to death. <quote>When I start firin<ch.apos/>, you see if you can pinpoint where he is.</quote></p>
      <p>You nod in uneasy agreement and get ready to glance around the tailgate the instant the captain opens fire. <quote>Let<ch.apos/>s do it!</quote> he says, as he rises above the cover of the truck and squeezes off a burst of automatic fire. The noise of his gun drowns out the sniper<ch.apos/>s shot, but within a second of his breaking cover, Frankland is hit.

      <p>Inadvertently, your fall saves your life. Another shot passes over your head barely a second after you stumble, missing you by a hand<ch.apos/>s breadth.

      <p>You fire, but your aim is too high and your shot passes harmlessly over the head of the leading biker. His passenger replies by levelling his pistol, resting it on his shoulder, and squeezing off three rounds in rapid succession. The first slug clips your right shoulder and sends you reeling backwards<ch.emdash/>lose 3 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points.</p>
      <p>Immediately, the captain and Sergeant Haskell rush to your aid. Captain Frankland attends to your wound, (erase one Medi-kit unit from your Backpack), while the sergeant picks up your gun and returns fire at the pursuing bikers (erase from your <a idref="action">Ammo Pouch</a> the quantity of ammunition that is equal to one round of fire). Above the roar of the engines you hear the leading rider scream out in pain: Haskell has wounded him in the hand, severing a finger. He loses control, swerves violently to the left, somersaults, and then his machine bursts into flame.</p>
      <p>The incident scares the other riders sufficiently for them to pull back to a safe distance. They continue to tail the truck, but at least they are now out of range.</p>

      <p>The clansman is halfway down the steps when your warning shout echoes from the bridge. Instantly, Sergeant Haskell reacts by springing forward and pounding up the steps towards the Mexican clansman, his combat blade held before him ready to strike. The Mexican sees Haskell and freezes in mid-step, his eyes widening with fear and shocked surprise. As he fumbles for his pistol, the sergeant tackles and stabs him to the heart, sending him tumbling backwards to land with a heavy thud on the stone-hard bank of the Rio Grande.</p>
      <p><quote>Well done, sergeant.

      <p>You stand up and take hold of the heavy machine gun as Captain Frankland drives off towards the west side of Lordsburg. Haskell locates an ammunition box and helps you to thread a belt of .50-calibre shells into the breech.</p>
      <p>Most of Mad Dog<ch.apos/>s clansmen are concentrated around the block of buildings where the truck was discovered, but there are some, most notably the Detroit Lions scouts, who have taken up lookout positions in other parts of the town.

      <p>It is not until you begin your approach to the access ramp of Interstate 10 that you encounter any problem. Soon after your truck was found, Mad Dog dispatched a unit of scouts in a pick-up to guard the freeway ramp, just in case. It was a smart move. When these scouts see you approaching, they switch on a spotlight mounted on the roof of the pick-up above the driver<ch.apos/>s seat, catching you in its beam. When a radio call confirms that you are not what you seem, they accelerate towards you in an attempt to run you off the road.</p>

You are about to ignore it and press on when suddenly you notice the roof of a cabin: it is set back from the track and is almost completely hidden by the pines. Aching with fatigue, and the pain of the minor injuries you have sustained during your flight from the assassin, you decide to investigate the cabin and rest there a while.</p>
      <p>The dwelling was once a private hunting lodge, owned by a wealthy family who lived in Las Cruces before <quote>The Day</quote>. Its doors and windows are secured, but the corroded locks are easily shattered and you soon gain entry.

      <p>Beyond Gleeson the road snakes its way through hills covered with pine, pi<ch.ntilde/>on, and dull grey rocks. The road surface deteriorates rapidly and very soon you are forced to stand in order to remain in full control of your bucking, bouncing machine. Then another, more serious hazard looms into view. A landslip from the surrounding hillside has heaped a mound of rock in the middle of the road ahead, blocking it completely. The only way to circumvent this obstacle involves a difficult descent into a gully that runs parallel to the road, and then an equally difficult climb out again.</p>

      <p>Desperately the clansman ducks to avoid your weapon, but it hits him on the forehead and sends him tumbling from the steps to land with a heavy thud on the stone-hard bank of the Rio Grande.</p>

      <p>You spin the steering wheel to the right, hoping to avoid the barrier, which is racing towards you at a terrific speed, but Mad Dog anticipates your move and rams you again, sending you to certain doom. Your car slews off the freeway and smashes into the central crash barrier, transforming it into a blazing fireball. With a scream of triumph, Mad Dog passes your burning car, happy in the knowledge that at last he has wrought his revenge.</p>

Then you hear the captain barking the order, <quote>Follow me!</quote> and see Knott and Haskell leaving the wall to run after him.

      <p>The man is easy to follow: a trail of freshly broken foliage clearly marks his escape route through the trees. His tracks end at a clearing, where a wide, crater-like hollow has been excavated from the rocky soil. You catch a glimpse of him hurrying into the hollow by way of a flight of steps that has been cut out of the earth. As you approach the crater, you notice that one side is constructed entirely from logs, and resembles the side of a pine cabin. Frantically the man bangs his clenched fists on a heavy door in the centre of the log wall, screaming to be let in. The door opens and he falls through it, slamming it shut behind him with a heavy thud.</p>

      <p>Your enemy screams and clutches at his chest as you deliver your killing blow. He falls backwards, and, as he rolls towards the tailgate, you notice a Pistol holstered on the rear of his belt. (If you wish to keep this weapon, you discover that it contains ten rounds of 9mm ammunition.)</p>
      <p>You rush forward to help Sergeant Haskell deal with his attacker. With your aid, he is able to prise the hands of his enemy from around his throat and, with a double-footed kick to the chest, send him tumbling backwards out of the truck. You are bundling your dead adversary after him when Knott overcomes his panic and manages to restart the engine. With a jolt the truck turns sharply to the left, and the bulldozer rumbles past with barely inches to spare.</p>
      <p>In an attempt to escape from the town, Knott heads towards a narrow side street, but as soon as you enter you are confronted by another hazard. Several of the houses that back on to the street have collapsed and the debris has formed a huge, uneven mound, completely blocking your path. Knott, confident that the truck is capable of scaling this obstacle, shifts the gear selector into all-wheel drive and stamps his foot on the gas pedal. Amid a whine of gears, the truck accelerates towards the mountain of bricks and shattered timbers, hitting the mound at speed. The truck lurches towards the peak, but shudders to a halt less than five feet from the top.</p>
      <p>Knott and the captain both leap from the cab, desperate to clear away the debris that has jammed the front wheels. As they begin work, three clansmen come running around the corner, firing their weapons as they sprint towards the truck. Haskell answers them with a burst of fire that fells the leading two, and sends the survivor scurrying for cover. However, this does little to deter the attack. More clansmen are appearing by the second, and you can tell by their blood-curdling screams that they do not intend to take prisoners.</p>

The only cover is a shallow gully that runs alongside the highway, and immediately you steer towards it.

Unfortunately, the clansman has taped his torch to the barrel of his machine pistol, which is already aimed at your chest. Callously he watches as you struggle to get clear, and then he pulls the trigger and sprays the window with a deadly hail of lead.</p>

      <p>Someone else must be living here in the forest, setting this type of snare to catch fresh food. You tell Knott of your find before proceeding with renewed caution.</p>

      <p>After several minutes of useless deliberation you try to lay aside these thoughts and apply yourself to the task of rejoining your colony. Without transport, the journey is going to be extremely difficult, so you decide to try to salvage your discarded motorcycle.

You are expecting to find little more than a twisted heap of scrap metal, so it comes as a welcome surprise to discover that the machine is still in working order. After straightening the handlebars and the front wheel alignment, you climb astride it and restart the engine on the fifth kick.</p>
      <p>You follow the wide trench until you find a suitable place to make your exit. The ascent is accomplished without difficulty, and, as you clear the crest of the gully, you bring your motorcycle to a halt in order to take a last look at the retreating clansman. For a moment the recent memory of your murdered companions sends a shiver along your spine, but the memory fades quickly when you wind back the throttle and gun your bike along the bumpy mountain road, heading west.</p>

      <p>Suddenly a terrible pain explodes in the nape of your neck and you are thrown forward by the impact of something heavy hitting you between the shoulders. You crash to the ground face-first but feel very little as the pain quickly gives way to a chilling numbness. You have been hit in the back by the clansman<ch.apos/>s crowbar, which has severed your spinal cord.</p>
      <deadend>You are helpless, unable to move or defend yourself as the clansman enacts a swift but brutal revenge for the death of his dogs. Tragically, your life and your mission end here in El Paso.</deadend>

      <p>A bullet misses your neck by inches and buries itself in the shoulder of Marine Knott, who is beside you in the passenger seat. The force of impact nearly hurls him out of the jeep, and, as he fights to prevent himself from falling, he grabs at your jacket, wrenching your hand off the steering wheel.</p>
      <p>With a screech of tyres, the jeep veers off the freeway towards the exit ramp. The captain and Sergeant Haskell come to Knott<ch.apos/>s aid, pulling him back into the vehicle. As you regain control of the steering wheel, you find yourself ascending the ramp towards Highway 80.</p>
      <p>In your driving mirror you see the clansmen turning their bikes around: they intend to pursue you. Unable to continue along the freeway, you put your foot to the floor and make a hasty escape heading south along Highway 80.</p>

      <p>Your enemy screams and crumples as you deliver your killing blow. He hits the floor, and, as he rolls towards the tailgate, you notice a Pistol and a Knife (2) tucked into his belt. (If you wish to keep the Pistol, you discover that it contains eight rounds of 9mm ammunition.)</p>
      <p>Sergeant Haskell is recovering from his fall as you move towards the cab to try to find out what is going on. To your horror you see a bright yellow bulldozer, with its earth scoop lowered, trundling along the main street on a collision course with the truck. Captain Frankland is screaming at Knott to move the truck out of the way of the oncoming bulldozer, but the engine refuses to start. The situation is looking hopeless when suddenly, with a roar, the engine fires into life. Knott kicks the gas pedal and swerves out of the way as the bulldozer bears down. Miraculously, it misses you, rumbling past with barely inches to spare.</p>
      <p>In an attempt to escape from the town, Knott heads towards a narrow side street, but as soon as you enter, you are confronted by another hazard. Several of the houses that back on to the street have collapsed and the debris has formed a huge, uneven mound, which blocks your path. Knott, confident that the truck is capable of scaling this obstacle, shifts the gear selector into all-wheel drive and stamps his foot on the gas pedal. Amid a whine of gears, the truck accelerates towards the mountain of bricks and shattered timbers. You hit the mound at speed and lurch towards the peak, but less than five feet from the top the truck shudders to a halt.</p>
      <p>Knott and the captain both leap from the cab, desperate to clear away the debris that has jammed the front wheels. As they begin their work three clansmen come running around the corner, firing their weapons as they sprint towards you. Haskell answers them with a burst of fire that fells the leading two, and sends the survivor scurrying for cover. However, this does little to deter the attack. More clansmen are appearing by the second, and from the sound of their blood-curdling screams they intend to take no prisoners.</p>

      <p>When at last the exhilaration of your unexpected reunion subsides, she tells you that the colony has already reached Tucson, and is safely encamped with the Tucson colony inside a stronghold they have established at the Davis-Monthan Air Force base. When you and the rest of Captain Frankland<ch.apos/>s team failed to make the Deming rendezvous, the colony continued as planned, hoping that you would join them <foreign xml:lang="fr">en route</foreign>. Gradually, as they progressed further west, their hopes faded until they accepted that you must have perished during the raid on Ciudad Juarez. But Kate refused to abandon hope. When the convoy reached Benson she insisted that she wait here in case you had been unable to find transport and were heading for Tucson on foot. Reluctantly they agreed to her request, knowing full well that there was little they could do to prevent her from staying.</p>
      <p>You ask if she has seen any clan activity during the twenty-four hours she has been here, and she says that there has been none. The freeway and the surrounding area have remained completely deserted.</p>

Frantically you throw out your arms in an attempt to find a new hand-hold, but you are already falling backwards and your flailing hands claw only air.

Wearily you drag yourself to your feet, rub your aching limbs, and then stagger towards your motorcycle. You are expecting to find little more than a twisted heap of scrap metal, so it comes as a pleasant surprise to discover that the machine is still in working order. After straightening the handlebars, the headlight, and the front wheel alignment, you are able to restart the engine with your fourth kick.</p>
      <p>You ride this wide trench until you find a suitable place, on the far side of the rockfalls to make your exit.

      <p>From the eastern end of the gully a cloud of dust is approaching. It is over a mile distant, but you can tell at once that it is being kicked up by a motorcycle. You stare at the approaching machine and, although you cannot see the rider, you know that it is the assassin. Chilled by his proximity, you wind back the throttle and gun your bike along the bumpy mountain road.</p>

      <p>Most of Mad Dog<ch.apos/>s clansmen are concentrated around the block of buildings where the truck was discovered, but there are some, most notably the Detroit Lions<ch.apos/> scouts, who have taken up lookout positions in other parts of the town.

      <p>It is not until you begin your approach to the access ramp of Interstate 10 that you encounter any problem. Soon after your truck was found, Mad Dog dispatched a unit of scouts in a pick-up to guard the freeway ramp, just in case. It was a smart move. When the scouts see you approaching, they switch on a spotlight mounted on the roof of the pick-up, above the driver<ch.apos/>s seat, and catch you in its beam.

      <p>You are shaken and bruised (lose 1 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> point) by the collision, and, as you fight to bring the heavy gun to bear on the pick-up, you swing too far and your first burst misses by several yards.

Then, as the warm breeze clears the lingering gun smoke, you see the body of the assassin lying motionless beside the courthouse wall.

      <p>With grim curiosity you move forward to search the body. You pull off his helmet and stare at the face of this killer.

HAVOC was proud of his ignoble feat, and when by chance they leaked his identity, his photograph appeared on every television screen and on the front page of every newspaper around the world.

      <p>While there is a lull in the firing, you seize the chance to help Knott and Captain Frankland clear away the debris that is blocking your escape. A thick, wooden pole, which once supported overhead electricity cables in this part of town, is jammed between the wheel and the truck<ch.apos/>s front fender. With your help they are at last able to shift it. Knott returns to the cab and starts the engine first time. Then, as he brings the truck over the mound, you and the captain leap onto the tailgate and pull yourselves aboard.</p>
      <p>The street ends at a piece of wasteland but a few hundred yards beyond it lies a highway running east to west. The captain peers through the cab<ch.apos/>s partition window and gives an ironic laugh when he sees the highway.</p>
      <p><quote>Make for that road and head west,</quote> he commands, and Knott obeys. Then he turns to the sergeant and says, <quote>It looks like you<ch.apos/>re finally outvoted, Haskell. Seems we<ch.apos/>re on our way to Mimbres.</quote></p>

      <p>By keeping strictly to alleys and side streets you are able to make your way deep into the heart of the city, avoiding the numerous clan patrols. At length you reach the banks of the Rio Grande and follow the river westwards towards your rendezvous destination. Your early encounters with Mad Dog<ch.apos/>s men have delayed you and now, as you hurry along the walkways and plazas bordering the river, you are fearful that you will arrive too late to join the others. In your haste you become less cautious and take risks that might prove dangerous.</p>
      <p>You are hurrying along a walled sidewalk when you catch sight of the Stanton Street Toll Bridge less than 400 yards away. You are confident that it is the right bridge because it is the only one still intact. A glance at your wristwatch reveals that you have less than ten minutes to spare. You are about to break into a run when suddenly you hear a noise behind you that makes you freeze: it is the sound of a pistol being cocked.</p>

      <p>The fear that Knott has somehow tripped an alarm vanishes as you realize that the siren is coming from the main entrance. It is announcing the arrival of the explosives convoy. Four trucks, each one carpeted in a layer of thick, red, desert dust, roar through the east gate and screech to a halt. You watch tensely as Mad Dog Michigan and one other, a Mexican whom you assume to be Santiago, run across to the vehicles and inspect their cargoes. Having satisfied themselves that all is in order, they proceed to berate the drivers for their poor timekeeping.</p>

      <p>With bated breath you watch as the two soldiers slip over the perimeter wall and crawl away from the safety of Fort Bliss. Expertly they merge with the broken wasteland so that you soon find it impossible to track their path, leading to an elevated section of Highway 54. Fifteen minutes later, all is still as quiet as the grave. You are sure that they have made it across the zone by now, and so you motion to Marine Knott to follow as you lower yourself head-first over the rampart and propel yourself across the rocky ground using only your elbows and knees.</p>
      <p>The faint moonlight serves both to help and hinder your progress as you inch your way towards the Montana Road, a highway that runs 100 yards in front of, and parallel to, the clansmen<ch.apos/>s position. Every move you make is slow and deliberate as though the ground were strewn with eggs, so urgent is the need to prevent dust from betraying your position. Eventually you reach a shallow ditch bordering the highway and you use it as cover as you advance towards a group of ruined buildings at the edge of the city. You are less than twenty yards from the ruins when you are frozen by the sound of howling dogs. They are clan bloodhounds and they have picked up your scent on the warm night air.</p>
      <p>With your pulse racing, you peer over the edge of the ditch, seeking to catch a clear view of the enemy. You cannot see them, but you can hear them approaching fast. You must act quickly if you are to avoid being caught by the hounds and their handlers.</p>

      <p>By the time the clansmen realize that you have given them the slip, you are a safe distance from the parking lot and heading into the heart of the city. By keeping strictly to alleys and side streets you are able to avoid clan patrols and reach the banks of the Rio Grande without incident. Then you head west, following the river towards your rendezvous destination.</p>
      <p>Your early encounters with Mad Dog<ch.apos/>s men have delayed you and now, as you hurry along the walkways and plazas bordering the river, you are fearful that you will arrive too late to join the others. In your haste you become less cautious, taking risks that might prove dangerous.</p>
      <p>You are hurrying along a walled sidewalk when you catch sight of the Stanton Street Toll Bridge less than 400 yards away. You are confident that it is the right bridge because it is the only one still intact. A glance at your wristwatch shows that you have less than ten minutes to spare. You are about to break into a run when suddenly you hear a noise behind you that makes you freeze: it is the sound of a pistol being cocked.</p>

      <p>One by one, a family colony of survivors climbs the stairs and files into the room. The first to appear is a man in his mid-thirties, lean and clean-shaven, yet bearing a striking resemblance to the man with the gun. He is followed by two women of about the same age; then two children appear: a boy aged about eight and a girl aged eleven or so.</p>

      <p>The captain leads the team through the buildings of the immigration control compound, and on towards the iron-framed service walkway. The gate to this section is locked but its rusty padlock is soon dealt with and stealthily you make your crossing. Below your feet, through the cage-like steel floor of the walkway, the waters of the Rio Grande glint in the moonlight. To your right lie the ruined remains of the Cordova Bridge. Its central span collapsed during the post-holocaust years, and the debris now forms an island of broken concrete that parts the waters near the middle of the river. The noisy rush of the water passing over this isle obscures the sound of your footfalls as the team hurries across the walkway towards the Mexican side of the border.</p>

A thick, wooden pole, which once supported overhead electricity cables in this part of town, is jammed between the wheel and the truck<ch.apos/>s front fender. With your help, they are at last able to dislodge it, and Knott braves the gunfire to climb into the cab.

      <p>The sound of the crash brings the clansmen to a halt at the side of the mountain road. They dismount from their machines and peel off their leather face masks before taking tentative steps towards the edge of the steep-sided canyon. The sight of the burning wreckage draws evil grins across their cruel faces, and when Knott<ch.apos/>s bloodstained tunic is found nearby, they laugh and howl like victorious jackals. Convinced that you are dead, their leader radios the news to Mad Dog Michigan. When he finishes the call he orders his scouts to remount their bikes and follow him back to Lordsburg. Only when you can no longer hear the thunderous growl of their bikes do you leave your hiding place and set off on foot along Highway 80, heading south.</p>

      <p>It is only an hour after the sun has risen and the temperature is already climbing above 90 degrees Fahrenheit. The prospect of spending a whole day walking in the burning desert heat is too dangerous to contemplate seriously, so when you see the town of Rodeo shimmering in the distance, you resolve to set about finding a replacement vehicle the moment you arrive.</p>
      <p>The highway cuts through the centre of this empty town, dividing it into two halves of roughly the same size. A derelict furniture store marks the start of the main street and it is here, in the shade of its awning, that you stop to rest. You must now take a Drink or lose 3 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points.</p>
      <p>Once you have recovered your strength, Captain Frankland and Sergeant Haskell pair up to search one half of the town while you and Knott search the other. You need to find a serviceable vehicle that will carry you as far as Tucson.</p>

      <p>Certain that you have missed nothing of any practical value, you leave the radio shop and return to your motorcycle. Before starting it, you check the engine and notice that the cooling fins are very hot to the touch: the lack of oil is causing the bore to overheat. As you kick start the engine, you hope desperately that the bike will continue to run long enough to carry you back to the colony.</p>

Knott sees you in the side mirror and starts the truck, smoke belching from the exhaust pipe as he revs the reluctant engine. The captain reaches the rear and clambers over the tailgate just as a couple of clansmen notice you running and start shouting wildly.

      <p>Steadily the highway climbs towards a pass, beyond which there is a hairpin bend. You manage to negotiate it safely, only to find that a rockfall has partially blocked the road less than twenty yards beyond the bend. Your driving instinct warns you not to brake heavily for fear of sending the jeep into a skid, so you try to steer around the mound of fallen rock without slowing down. Your tactics work: you clear the mound with inches to spare. Unluckily, as you straighten the steering wheel, you strike a stray boulder and the jeep is brought to a grinding halt.</p>
      <p><quote>The front running gear<ch.apos/>s wrecked,</quote> says Captain Frankland, despondently, as he inspects the damage. <quote>There<ch.apos/>s no way we<ch.apos/>ll get any further in this vehicle.</quote></p>
      <p>The situation looks bleak: the clansmen are likely to show up at any time and they are sure to catch you now that the jeep is wrecked. Then an idea occurs to you that might just throw them off your trail. If you were to set fire to the jeep and push it into the deep canyon that borders this section of the mountain road, the sight of the burning wreckage might convince them that you had met with a fatal accident. The others agree that it is worth a try and immediately set about preparing the jeep. Together you manhandle it to the edge of the road, and then light a rag, which Haskell has stuffed into the gasolene filler pipe. Once it is burning, you give one last push and send the vehicle careering over the edge into the canyon 300 feet below. After the resounding crash, you hear the clansmen approaching and you quickly take cover among the boulders. To make it seem more realistic Marine Knott drops his bloodstained tunic at the edge of the road before he takes cover, seconds before the first riders appear on the scene.</p>

      <p>In order to reach Highway 9, you have to pass within 100 yards of an adobe shack. It looks no different in style or state to a dozen others dotted around the town, but, unbeknown to you, this one is used as an outpost by the Mexicans who occupy Columbus.</p>
      <p>As the truck approaches, three clan lookouts emerge from the side door and walk slowly across the highway. Their leader, a fat-bellied renegade with grey hair and a drooping moustache, stops in the middle and raises a pudgy hand. Knott ignores his signal to stop. Instead, he steps on the gas and sends the three clansmen diving to avoid the truck. You roar past, but they are quick to recover and immediately they start firing at the tailgate.</p>

      <p>The three other members of the sabotage team are waiting for you at an earth rampart that forms part of the southern perimeter wall. In a hushed voice, Captain Frankland gives a final briefing, while you join with the others in applying camouflage blacking to your face, and taping your weapons and equipment to muffle any noise. Five hundred yards away, across a rubble-strewn no-man<ch.apos/>s-land, clan snipers are entrenched behind a makeshift barricade of old cars and other debris. Their rifles are trained on Fort Bliss and, in the past, they have been all too eager to use them whenever a target has presented itself. Crossing this zone will be perilous in the extreme and, in order to minimize the risks of the mission failing here, the captain proposes that the team split into pairs and cross the zone at two separate locations. Each pair is to make its way through the enemy cordon and the city beyond, and then regroup at the Stanton Street Toll Bridge at 1 a.m. precisely. You synchronize watches before joining with your chosen partner, Marine Knott, in getting ready to go.</p>
      <p>There are two routes open to you. The most direct path will take you south, through the heart of El Paso where the enemy are most numerous. Or you can attempt a detour around the northern edge of the city before you try to reach the bridge, a longer but possibly less dangerous route.</p>

For a terrible moment, the fear wells up and consumes you, and all you want to do is run as far away and as fast as you can. Despite Knott<ch.apos/>s pleas to stay where you are, you scramble to your feet and stumble blindly towards the woods. In your haste, you trip and fall, grazing your hands and knees on the flint-sharp shale: lose 1 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> point.</p>
      <p>Inadvertently, your fall saves your life. A shot passes over your head a second after you stumble, missing you by a hand<ch.apos/>s breadth. The imminent danger clears your mind and you race towards the trees with a determination to survive. Knott encourages you to increase your speed and you pray that you will reach cover before the sniper has a chance to slip another round into the breech of his rifle.</p>

      <p>With bated breath you watch as Sergeant Haskell and Captain Frankland stalk towards the jeep. The two Mavericks are oblivious of their presence as they circle around silently and creep up on them from behind. A heavy, belt-fed machine gun, mounted on a column behind the front seats, helps to conceal their approach until they are crouching behind the jeep itself.</p>
      <p>For a few seconds there is absolute silence, and then you see them leap forward and grapple the unsuspecting clansmen, striking swiftly and silently. As soon as it is all over, the captain signals to you and Knott to join them. You rush to the jeep and help the sergeant search the Mavericks<ch.apos/> bodies before hiding them in the bus depot.</p>

      <p>As they approach, the clansmen train their spotlight on the jeep<ch.apos/>s windscreen in an attempt to blind Captain Frankland. Despite the glare, he controls the vehicle admirably, veering away at the last moment to avoid collision with the oncoming truck. As the pick-up flashes past, you swing around and open fire at its trunk.</p>

      <p>Captain Frankland and Sergeant Haskell emerge from the shadows and hurry forward to join you. They apologize for giving you such a scare, but you can tell by the wide grins on their faces that they are clearly amused by your jumpy reaction.

      <p>While there is a lull in the firing, you seize the chance to help Knott and Captain Frankland clear away the debris that is blocking your escape. A thick, wooden pole, which once supported overhead electricity cables in this part of town, is jammed between the wheel and the truck<ch.apos/>s front fender. With your help, they are at last able to shift it and Knott returns to the cab and starts the engine first time. As he brings the truck over the mound, you and the captain leap onto the tailgate and pull yourselves aboard.</p>

Then you spot a glint of chrome reflecting the pale pre-dawn twilight, and suddenly there is a piercing blue-white glare as six black-clad clansmen simultaneously switch on their headlights as they race along Highway 80 towards the intersection. Their machines are drawn up in a perfect wedge formation, giving them the semblance of a giant, fiery arrow-head as they come speeding down the freeway access ramp towards your jeep. Now, as they close in, you see that the riders are wearing black face-protectors, which are fitted with infrared lenses, enabling them to see in the dark without the need for artificial light. They are all heavily armed, and the pennons that flutter from the whiplash aerials fixed to their saddles identify them as scouts for the Detroit Lions clan.</p>

      <p>The engine emits the ominous sound of grinding metal and immediately the rattling ceases. Unfortunately, so too does the engine. The piston has become so hot that the rings that seal it have welded themselves to the bore. At once you realize what has happened, and, as you steer the powerless machine to the side of the street, you are filled with dread at the prospect of having to continue your journey on foot. You must now take a Drink or lose 3 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points.</p>
      <p>You are staring gloomily at the ruined machine, considering your next course of action, when you hear a vehicle approaching. Your dread deepens when you look up to see an all-too-familiar dust cloud approaching the town from the east.</p>

      <p>Halfway along the main street you discover a used car lot that specialized in commercial and recreational vehicles. The faded billboards boast that <quote>only the best vehicles are to be found here</quote>, but sadly this claim is long out-of-date. Most of the trucks and RVs are totally wrecked, and nearly all have tyres and batteries that have perished during the post-holocaust years. A battered Toyota pick-up rests on its side, hardly warranting a second glance until you notice that its tyres are still sound. Knott helps you to heave it back onto all four wheels and then goes to fetch the others while you make a closer examination of the engine. Apart from a dead battery and lack of fuel, the pick-up is in remarkably good condition.</p>
      <p>You are checking the air filter when the others arrive. Although they have not been able to locate a vehicle in better condition, their search has not been entirely fruitless. They did find some gasolene, which Sergeant Haskell proceeds to pour into the pick-up<ch.apos/>s fuel tank.</p>
      <p><quote>That solves one problem,</quote> you say, as you replace the air filter, <quote>but we<ch.apos/>ll still need some electrical power to get this engine started.</quote></p>

For a few seconds the men remain stationary, and then they split up and begin to search along the rows in your immediate vicinity.

      <p>Soon the truck is beyond the range of the clansmen<ch.apos/>s rifles and you are able to pick yourself up off the floor. Your body feels stiff and sore, but at least both you and Sergeant Haskell are still in one piece.

      <p>All the advanced driving skills that you learned from Cutter Jacks, and which you perfected during the months you patrolled the highways around McKinney, pay off now as you negotiate this hazardous section of mountain highway. However, the clansmen are equally proficient roadmasters and they are gaining on you, relentlessly closing the gap.</p>
      <p>The more you think about your predicament, the more you realize how futile it is to try to outrun them. Even if you were able to defeat all the scouts, Mad Dog Michigan would simply send more and more until his lust for vengeance had finally been sated. Then an idea occurs to you that might just throw him off your trail for good. If you were able to convince the enemy that you were dead, it would put an end to their pursuit. You share your thoughts with the others and they agree with your reasoning.</p>
      <p><quote>You<ch.apos/>re right, Cal. We<ch.apos/>ll have to stage an accident and convince the clansmen that we<ch.apos/>ve all been killed,</quote> says Captain Frankland.</p>
      <p>Soon you reach a part of the mountains where a deep canyon borders the road. Here you bring the jeep to a halt and immediately set about preparing the <quote>accident</quote>. You push the vehicle to the edge of the road, and then light a rag, which Haskell has stuffed into the gasolene filler pipe. It ignites and once it is burning you give the jeep a push and send it careering over the edge into the canyon 300 feet below. After the resounding crash, you hear the clansmen approaching and you quickly take cover behind some boulders. To make it seem more realistic, Marine Knott drops his bloodstained tunic at the edge of the road before he joins you, seconds before the first clansmen appear on the scene.</p>

      <p>The captain screams and throws his hands to his face: he has been hit. Blood oozes thickly through his fingers as he crumples slowly to the ground, the assassin<ch.apos/>s bullet lodged deeply in his skull.</p>
      <p>The shock of Frankland<ch.apos/>s death, following so closely after Sergeant Haskell<ch.apos/>s, hits you like an icy shower. You cower behind the truck, shivering with fear, afraid that you will be next. For a terrible moment the fear consumes you, and all you want to do is run as far and as fast as you can. Knott has taken cover among the pines and he pleads with you to stay where you are. But you cannot think clearly; panic has overwhelmed your senses.

      <p>The truck slams through the wall of cars with a tremendous crash. The impact sends a violent shudder through the floor but the truck is slowed very little by the collision. Once clear of the barricade, Knott accelerates along the main street and you hear angry voices and the sharp crackle of automatic gunfire amidst the roar of the vehicle<ch.apos/>s engine. The air becomes livid with the sound of singing bullets, which pierce the canvas and shatter against the truck<ch.apos/>s cage-like frame. An occasional fragment singes your skin but otherwise you and the sergeant escape unharmed.</p>
      <p>Haskell is at the tailgate, returning fire at the clansmen who were guarding the barricade, forcing them to quit their shooting and dive for cover. You join him and focus your sights on the doorways of the passing stores, where sleepy-eyed clansmen are stumbling into the street to investigate the commotion. (Erase from your <a idref="action">Ammo Pouch</a> ammunition equivalent to one round of fire.)</p>
      <p>You are starting to feel confident that you have beaten the clansmen when you feel the truck decelerating. A glance over your shoulder in the direction of the cab window reveals why Knott is slowing down. A bright yellow bulldozer, with its earth scoop lowered, is trundling along the main street towards you. The captain screams an order and Knott obeys. He spins the steering wheel and sends the truck screeching sharply to the left towards a narrow side street. His quick reactions and driving skill have saved you from the bulldozer, but immediately you are confronted by a new hazard.</p>
      <p>Several of the houses that back on to this street have collapsed, and the debris has formed a huge, uneven mound that blocks your path. Knott, confident that the truck is capable of scaling this obstacle, shifts the selector into all-wheel drive and stamps his foot on the gas pedal. Amid a whine of gears, the truck accelerates towards the mountain of bricks and shattered timbers. You hit the mound at speed and the truck lurches towards the peak, but, less than five feet from the top, the truck shudders to a halt.</p>
      <p>Knott and the captain both leap from the cab desperate to clear away the debris that has jammed the front wheels. As they begin their work, three clansmen come running around the corner, firing their weapons as they sprint towards the truck. Haskell answers them with a burst of fire that fells the leading two and sends the survivor scurrying for cover. This does little to deter the attack: more clansmen are appearing by the second, and, judging by their blood-curdling screams, they do not intend to take prisoners.</p>
