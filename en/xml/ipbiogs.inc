   <p><strong>Ian Page</strong> was born in London in 1960. Since the age of sixteen he has pursued a successful career as a singer/songwriter. With the band Secret Affair, he had a string of chart hits to his credit including <cite>Time for Action</cite> and <cite>My World</cite>. His interest in the fantastic worlds of <quote>Sword and Sorcery</quote> dates back to his early teens, and to his love of the novels of J.R.R. Tolkien and Michael Moorcock. It was in 1979, when Joe Dever introduced him to role-playing games, that his involvement in the world of Magnamund began. He contributed greatly to the development of the southern reaches of this fantastic world, and worked closely with Joe on several other role-playing games projects that include TV and radio appearances.</p>
   <p>Ian has since re-entered the music industry with a band known as <a href="&link.the.affair.website;">The Affair</a>.</p>
