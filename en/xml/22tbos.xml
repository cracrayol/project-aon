     <p>You are a Kai Grand Master of the New Order of the Kai<ch.emdash/>the warrior <ch.eacute/>lite of Sommerlund.</p>

     <p>It is the year MS<ch.nbsp/>5083 and thirty-three years have passed since the First Order of the Kai was almost wiped out by the Darklords of Helgedad. These champions of evil, who were sent by the Dark God Naar to destroy your fertile world of Magnamund, have since been destroyed. The leader of your illustrious fighting order<ch.emdash/>Lone Wolf<ch.emdash/>was the sole survivor of the massacre. As a young Kai initiate he stood amidst the burning wreckage of the old Kai Monastery and vowed to avenge the slaughter of his comrades. In the year MS<ch.nbsp/>5070 he kept his pledge when alone he infiltrated the foul domain of the Darklords and destroyed the infernal city of Helgedad, the base of their evil power.</p>

     <p>With the fall of Helgedad, chaos befell the Darkland armies who had, until then, been poised to conquer all Magnamund. Quickly their disorder escalated into a mutinous civil war which allowed the Freeland armies of Magnamund time in which to recover and launch a successful counter-offensive. Against all odds, a swift and total victory was secured over the feuding armies of evil.</p>

     <p>Following the demise of the Darklords, peace reigned in your homeland of Sommerlund. Under the direction of Lone Wolf the ruined Monastery of the Kai was rebuilt and restored to its former glory, and the raising of a New Order of Kai warriors was swiftly established. You are one of this new generation of Kai recruits. You were born in Sommerlund in the year MS<ch.nbsp/>5063, during the time of the war against the Darklords. When you were seven years old you were sent by your father to the Kai Monastery. There, under the tutelage of Lone Wolf, you developed your martial skills and honed the special Kai abilities which lay dormant within you. During the years that followed, your skills were nurtured and sharpened to perfection by long hours of study and rigorous training. Your exceptional talent helped you to master all of the Kai and Magnakai Disciplines and you rose swiftly through the ranks of the New Order to become one of only five who now hold the high rank of Kai Grand Master. It is an achievement which has brought great honour upon you and your family.</p>

     <p>In the year MS<ch.nbsp/>5077 your skill and courage were put to the test when an attack was launched upon the Kai Monastery during Lone Wolf<ch.apos/>s absence. By means of a Shadow Gate (an astral corridor between the physical world of Magnamund and the many ethereal domains which lie beyond it) the Dark God Naar sent forth a host of dragon-creatures to besiege the monastery and lay waste of all Sommerlund. He had chosen his time well, yet his evil plan was thwarted by the tenacious defence that you and your brethren maintained until the siege was raised by Lone Wolf and the King<ch.apos/>s Army of Sommerlund.</p>

     <p>The defeat of his minions enraged Naar and inflamed his lust for vengeance. Three years later he created and sent to Sommerlund an evil champion called <quote>Wolf<ch.apos/>s Bane</quote> who was the very image of Lone Wolf. While your leader was engaged upon a quest overseas, this impostor terrorized your homeland in his guise and sought to destroy the reputation and the honour of the Kai. He would have succeeded had not Lone Wolf returned home and pursued this enemy to an ancient necropolis in the Sommlending city of Tyso. There, deep within a subterranean crypt, he and his evil alter-ego were drawn through a Shadow Gate to the Plane of Darkness<ch.emdash/>Naar<ch.apos/>s stronghold<ch.emdash/>where a deadly duel ensued. Lone Wolf vanquished the foe and discovered that Naar had in his possession the fabled Moonstone of the Shianti. This wondrous artefact was created many thousands of years ago by the god-like Shianti, whose presence upon Magnamund heralded the dawn of humanity. This stone of power contains the combined might of all their magic and wisdom, the sum of all their knowledge. So significant was the creation of this stone that all time on Magnamund has since been measured from the date of its creation. It had long been held that the Moonstone<ch.apos/>s location was a secret known only to the remnants of the Shianti, who dwell upon the mysterious Isle of Lorn in Southern Magnamund, yet the evidence of Lone Wolf<ch.apos/>s eyes had told him that this mystical artefact had somehow fallen into the hands of Naar.</p>

     <p>Lone Wolf realized that the Dark God had been using its legendary powers to generate Shadow Gates within the world of Magnamund, at locations and times of his own choosing. Such power had enabled him to send his loathsome champions to your home world while the force of the Gods of Good, Kai and Ishir, had been held at bay. Lone Wolf and the New Order Kai were all that stood against the onslaught of Naar<ch.apos/>s agents following the demise of the Darklords.</p>

     <p>Lone Wolf successfully escaped from the Plane of Darkness and returned to Sommerlund, yet he knew that the fight against Evil had not been won outright. He realised that he would have to return to the Plane of Darkness and retrieve the fabled Moonstone. Only by doing so would Magnamund truly be safe from an invasion by Naar<ch.apos/>s legions of darkness. Two years ago, with the aid of his most trusted ally, Lord Rimoah of Dessi, Lone Wolf fulfilled his vow by journeying to the Dark God<ch.apos/>s domain and retrieving the Moonstone of the Shianti. Upon his triumphant return, Lone Wolf placed the Moonstone in the Vault of the Sun<ch.emdash/>his personal chamber located deep below the fortified citadel of the Kai Monastery. He had hoped that the fabled artefact could remain there indefinitely, to be guarded by generations of Kai who would keep it secure from Naar<ch.apos/>s minions. Retrieval of the Moonstone had denied the Dark God<ch.apos/>s champions ready access to Magnamund, yet Lone Wolf knew that there were many lesser agents of Naar upon Magnamund waiting quietly in the shadows for the chance to do his evil bidding. Undoubtedly they would stop at nothing to retrieve the Moonstone for their fell master.</p>

     <p>Within a year of his return home it became clear to Lone Wolf that his wish could not be fulfilled. At first the presence of the Moonstone seemed greatly beneficial to Sommerlund. Crops grew abundantly, incidence of disease and illness became increasingly rare, and the newly-born were uniformly healthy. Even the offspring of the impoverished who, in normal times, could expect only one in three of their infants to survive longer than a month beyond birth, were all in good health and exceptional in their physical and mental development. The Sommlending called this extraordinary period of providence the <quote>Blessing of the Moonstone</quote>, yet this time of good fortune could not last. The power of the Moonstone is a great force for Good, but it is also greatly disruptive of the natural order of Magnamund. Soon death itself became a rarity in Sommerlund, and the four seasons of the year were slowly transformed into one unending spring. Lone Wolf was deeply concerned at the changes wrought by the Moonstone and sought the counsel of his closest friend<ch.emdash/>Guildmaster Banedon, leader of Sommerlund<ch.apos/>s Brotherhood of Magicians. Banedon entreated him to relinquish the Moonstone before the effects of its power became irreversible. To right the imbalance of nature the Moonstone would have to be taken to the Isle of Lorn, in the southernmost reaches of Magnamund, and delivered back into the hands of the Shianti. Only they, its creators, could prevent its powers from disrupting the natural order of your world.</p>

     <p>Lone Wolf agreed with Banedon<ch.emdash/>the Moonstone would have to be returned to the Shianti. The physical effects of its presence were beginning to attract the unwelcome attentions of those who secretly desire to enact Naar<ch.apos/>s revenge upon the Kai. When one of Naar<ch.apos/>s agents was captured by a Kai patrol within a few miles of the monastery, Lone Wolf felt he could wait no longer. He resolved to act immediately. Preparations were made for a long journey and, especially among the lower ranks of the Kai, rumours were rife that your leader would personally take responsibility for returning the Moonstone to the Shianti. Indeed, this speculation seemed to be confirmed as fact when it was discovered that Lone Wolf had secured the use of Guildmaster Banedon<ch.apos/>s famous flying ship<ch.emdash/><cite>Cloud-dancer</cite>.</p>

     <p>It therefore came as a shock when, early one morning, you were summoned unexpectedly to the Vault of the Sun. In strictest confidence, Supreme Master Lone Wolf informed you that he had decided to entrust you with the task of returning the Moonstone to the Shianti. His elaborate preparations were simply a diversion, a bluff designed to draw attention away from the vital mission that he wished you<ch.emdash/>the most talented and courageous of his five Kai Grand Masters<ch.emdash/>to undertake. It was with great pride and apprehension that you accepted the quest.</p>

     <p>Lone Wolf gave you the precious Moonstone in a seemingly ordinary satchel, yet the lining of this plain leather bag was woven from korlinium, a special mineral that would hide the Moonstone<ch.apos/>s powerful energies from the agents of Naar. In the guise of a Kai journeyman, you set sail from the Sommlending capital of Holmgard aboard a caravel that was to carry you south on the first leg of your journey, a voyage of 2,000 miles to Elzian, the capital of Dessi. This legendary city is home to Lord Rimoah and the Elder Magi. They are the last surviving members of Magnamund<ch.apos/>s oldest race of magicians and they had promised Lone Wolf that they would help you reach your final destination. You had hoped and expected the voyage would be swift and uneventful; however fate and ill fortune decreed otherwise. Your ship was attacked by pirates off the coast of Vassagonia and badly damaged. It limped to the port of Cape Kabar where you were forced to continue the long journey by overland routes to Elzian. This trek was fraught with danger, yet you overcame the many perils ranged against you and eventually arrived at the Dessian capital, to the relief of Lord Rimoah and his anxious brother magicians who had feared the worst.</p>

     <p>Now the final and most challenging part of your voyage to the Isle of Lorn lies ahead. And it is a journey that may prove more difficult than any you have undertaken so far, for it will lead you deep into the wild and lawless reaches of Southern Magnamund.</p>

     <p>You keep a record of your adventure on the <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
     <p>During the years you have spent in training at the Kai Monastery, you have devoted yourself to further developing your fighting prowess (<typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ>) and physical stamina (<typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ>). Before you begin this <cite>New Order</cite> adventure you need to measure how effective your training has been. To do this take a pencil and, with your eyes closed, point the blunt end of it onto the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a>. If you pick a 0 it counts as zero.</p>
     <p>The first number that you pick from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> in this way represents your <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ>. Add 25 to the number you picked and write the total in the <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> section of your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a> (i.e. if your pencil fell on the number 7 in the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> you would write in a <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> of 32). When you fight, your <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> will be pitted against that of your enemy. A high score in this section is therefore desirable.</p>
     <p>The second number that you pick from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> represents your powers of <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ>. Add 30 to this number and write the total in the <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> section of your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a> (i.e. if your pencil fell on the number 8 on the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> you would have 38 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points).</p>
     <p>If you are wounded in combat you will lose <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points. If at any time your <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points fall to zero or below, you are dead and the adventure is over. Lost <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points can be regained during the course of the adventure, but your number of <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points cannot rise above the number you have when you start an adventure.</p>
     <p>If you have successfully completed the previous adventure in the <cite>Lone Wolf New Order</cite> series (Book 21), you can carry your current scores of <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> and <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points over to this adventure. You may also carry over any Special Items, Kai Weapon, normal Weapons, and Backpack Items you had in your possession at the end of your last adventure, and these should be entered on your new <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>. If you have completed the previous <cite>Lone Wolf New Order</cite> adventure, remember to choose an additional Grand Master Discipline and add <ch.plus/>1 to your basic <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> and <ch.plus/>2 to your basic <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ>.</p>
     <p><strong>Playing Tip:</strong> You may use a 10-sided die instead of the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> if you find it more convenient.</p>

       <p>It has long been the tradition of your <ch.eacute/>lite warrior caste to bestow a new name upon each young novice when they complete their first year<ch.apos/>s training at the Kai Monastery. Kai names are chosen by senior Kai Masters with the aim of reflecting the individual strengths and qualities of each novice.</p>
       <p>You may create your own Kai name for yourself, or you can generate a Kai name at random using the name tables below. To generate a Kai name, pick a number from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> and consult Table A. The name which corresponds to the number you have picked is the first part, or prefix, of your Kai name. Now pick a second number from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> and consult Table B. The name which corresponds to the number you have picked is the second part, or suffix, of your Kai name. Put the prefix and the suffix together and you have your own personal Kai name.</p>

         <p>After years of martial training and study at the Kai Monastery, and by the rigorous practice of the teachings of your illustrious mentor<ch.emdash/>Kai Supreme Master Lone Wolf<ch.emdash/>you have achieved the noble rank of Kai Grand Master Senior.</p>

         <p>Following in the footsteps of Lone Wolf himself, you have vowed that one day you will become totally proficient in all 16 of the New Order Kai Grand Master Disciplines. By doing so successfully you will share with Lone Wolf the responsibility, the honour, and the future glory of leading the New Order Kai as a Supreme Master.</p>

         <p>If this is the first <cite>New Order</cite> adventure you have undertaken, then your present rank is that of Kai Grand Master Senior. This means that you have mastered <em>five</em> of the New Order Grand Master Disciplines listed below. It is for you to decide which five Disciplines these are. As all of the New Order Grand Master Disciplines may be of use to you at some point during your mission, pick these five skills with care. The correct use of a New Order Grand Master Discipline at the right time could save your life. When you have chosen your five Disciplines, enter them in the Grand Master Disciplines section of your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>.</p>

         <p>Upon reaching the ultimate rank of Kai Supreme Master, Lone Wolf received as a reward from the God Kai many new skills and abilities. One of these skills was Kai Weaponcraft. Using his newfound mastery, Lone Wolf forged ten weapons of magical power in the armoury furnaces of the Kai Monastery. These magical weapons are reserved for the <ch.eacute/>lite of the New Order Kai who attain the rank of Grand Master.</p>

         <p>In recognition of your rank and achievement, you may choose your own Kai Weapon from the table below or, if you prefer, you can generate one at random. To generate a Kai Weapon, pick a number from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> and consult the first column. The magical Axe, Sword, or Broadsword which corresponds to the number you have picked will be your own personal Kai Weapon. Record this magical weapon and its unique properties in the Kai Weapon section of the <a idref="action">Special Items List</a>. If you have completed the previous <cite>Lone Wolf New Order</cite> adventure (Book 21), you already possess a Kai Weapon.</p>

         <p><strong>Example</strong></p>
         <p>Say you choose the number 8 from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a>, your Kai Weapon will be the Broadsword <quote>Illuminatus</quote>.</p>

         <p>When using this Kai Weapon in normal combat you may add <ch.plus/>5 points to your <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ>. Each Kai Weapon has a unique property. When you use your Kai Weapon in combat against the type of enemy that matches its unique property, or use it at the optimum time or location, then you may add the higher bonus to your <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> (these bonuses are not cumulative).</p>

         <p><strong>Example</strong></p>
         <p>If you were to use <quote>Illuminatus</quote> in combat against an enemy in an underground cavern, cave, or tunnel, you could add the higher bonus of 7 to your <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ>. If you were to fight this enemy in any other location, the bonus to your <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> would remain at 5.</p>

            <p>In order to use a Bow you must possess a Quiver and at least one Arrow. Each time the Bow is used, erase an Arrow from your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>.

       <p>There will be occasions during your adventure when you will have to fight an enemy. The enemy<ch.apos/>s <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> and <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points are given in the text. Your aim in the combat is to kill the enemy by reducing his <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points to zero while losing as few <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points as possible yourself.</p>
       <p>At the start of a combat, enter your own and the enemy<ch.apos/>s <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points in the appropriate boxes on the Combat Record section of your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
       <p>The sequence for combat is as follows:</p>
       <ol class="paragraphed">
        <li><p>Add any extra points gained through your Grand Master Disciplines and Special Items to your current <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> total.</p></li>
        <li>
         <p>Subtract the <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> of your enemy from this total. The result is your Combat Ratio. Enter it on the <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
         <p>Example</p>
         <p>You, Grand Master (<typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> 32), are attacked in a forest by a pack of Wild Dogs (<typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> 31). You are taken by surprise and are not given the opportunity of evading their attack. You possess the Grand Master Discipline of Kai-surge to which the Wild Dogs are not immune, so you add 8 points to your <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ>. You also possess the Kai Weapon <quote>Ulnarias</quote>, so you add an additional 5 points to your <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ>. This gives you a total <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> of 45.</p>
         <p>You now subtract the Wild Dogs<ch.apos/> <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> from your own, giving a Combat Ratio of <ch.plus/>14 (45<ch.minus/>31=<ch.plus/>14). <ch.plus/>14 is noted on your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a> as the Combat Ratio.</p>
        </li>
        <li><p><a id="stage3">When you have your Combat Ratio</a>, pick a number from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a>.</p></li>
        <li>
         <p>Turn to the <a idref="crtable">Combat Results Table</a>. Along the top of the chart are shown the Combat Ratio numbers. Find the number that is the same as your Combat Ratio and cross-reference it with the random number that you have picked (the random numbers appear on the side of the chart). You now have the number of <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points lost by both yourself and your enemy in this round of combat. (E represents points lost by the enemy; GM represents points lost by yourself<ch.emdash/>Grand Master.)</p>
         <p>Example</p>
         <p>The Combat Ratio between you and the Wild Dogs has been established as <ch.plus/>14. If the number picked from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> is 1, then the result of the first round of combat is:</p>
         <ul>
          <li>You (GM) lose 3 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points (plus an additional 1 point for using Kai-surge. This loss is in addition to the loss suffered as a result of combat).</li>
          <li>Wild Dogs lose 9 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points.</li>
         </ul>
        </li>
        <li><p>On the <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>, mark the changes in <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points to the participants in the combat.</p></li>
        <li><p>Unless otherwise instructed, or unless you have an option to evade, the next round of combat now starts.</p></li>
        <li><p>Repeat the sequence from <a idref="stage3">Stage 3</a>.</p></li>
       </ol>

       <p>This process of combat continues until the <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points of either your enemy or yourself are reduced to zero or below, at which point that combatant is declared dead. If you are declared dead, the adventure is over. If the enemy is dead, you can proceed but with your <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points possibly reduced.</p>
       <p>A <a idref="crsumary">summary of Combat Rules</a> appears in the back of this book.</p>

        <data>
         <p>During your adventure you may be given the chance to evade combat. If you have already engaged in a round of combat and decide to evade, calculate the combat for that round in the usual manner. All points lost by the enemy as a result of that round are ignored, and you make your escape. Only <strong>you</strong> may lose <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points during that round (such is the risk of turning tail and running away during combat!). You may only evade if the text of the particular section allows you to do so.</p>

        <data>
         <p>If you are a New Order Kai who has attained the rank of Kai Grand Master Superior, you will now benefit from improvements to the following Grand Master Disciplines:</p>
         <dl class="paragraphed">
          <dt>Animal Mastery</dt>
           <dd><p>Kai Grand Master Superiors who possess this Discipline are able to deter predatory animals in the wild by exuding a scent which is repellent to them. In order for this improved Discipline to work effectively, a Kai Grand Master Superior must be aware of the species of predatory animal he/she wishes to deter. The scent can only be detected by the targeted animal.</p></dd>
          <dt>Assimilance</dt>
           <dd><p>Kai Grand Master Superiors who possess this skill are able to create a noise and project it up to 15 yards away from their location. The noise is akin to the rumbling sound of thunder and it can be used to distract or divert an enemy<ch.apos/>s attention. This improved Discipline requires a degree of preparation and therefore it cannot be used during combat.</p></dd>
          <dt>Astrology</dt>
           <dd><p>Kai Grand Master Superiors who possess this Discipline are skilled in the use of all mechanical devices designed to measure and/or observe the cosmology of Magnamund. Such devices include sextants, astrolabes, and orreries.</p></dd>
          <dt>Herbmastery</dt>
           <dd><p>Kai Grand Master Superiors who have this Discipline are able to purify water, thereby making contaminated or briny water suitable for consumption. Roughly two pints of water per day can be purified using this skill alone. This daily total steadily increases as a Grand Master advances in rank.</p></dd>
          <dt>Elementalism</dt>
           <dd><p>Kai Grand Master Superiors who possess this skill are able to condense pure water out of the surrounding air. This water can be made to fall as a fine spray or as a sudden deluge. It can also be made to fill any suitable container or receptacle. Using this skill, Grand Master Superiors can create the equivalent of one large bucketful of fresh water.</p></dd>
          <dt>Bardsmanship</dt>
           <dd><p>Kai Grand Master Superiors who possess this Discipline are able to utilize their musical skills to pacify an excited or hostile animal.</p></dd>
         </dl>
        </data>
       </section>

       <p>The nature of additional improvements and how they affect your existing Grand Master Disciplines will be noted in the Improved Grand Master Disciplines section of future <cite>Lone Wolf New Order</cite> books.</p>

     <p>You are about to embark upon the final stage of a vital mission to return the fabled Moonstone of the Shianti to its creators.</p>

     <p>Some of the material items that you will encounter during your quest will be of use to you, while others may be red herrings of no real value at all. If you discover items, be selective in what you choose to keep.</p>

     <p>Pick your five Grand Master Disciplines with care, for a wise choice will enable any player to complete the quest, no matter how weak their initial <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> and <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> scores may be. Completion of previous <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> adventures (Books 1<ch.endash/>21) may be advantageous, but it is not essential for the successful completion of this <cite>New Order</cite> adventure.</p>

     <p>May the light of the Gods Kai and Ishir guide you during your important quest.</p>

       <p>For three days you are treated to the lavish hospitality of the Elder Magi and the freedom of the wondrous city of Elzian. Then, on the morning of the fourth day, having fully recovered from the rigours of your journey to Dessi, you meet with Lord Rimoah in the Tower of Truth to discuss the final stage of your quest<ch.emdash/>the voyage to the Isle of Lorn. He informs you that passage has been arranged for you aboard a Suhnese trading ship called <cite>The Azan</cite> which sails tomorrow at dawn. The ship<ch.apos/>s master, Captain Jenkshi, has been paid generously to carry you to his home port of Suhn, and you can expect to be well treated by him and his crew. It will be a long voyage, some 2,500 miles in all, but not all of it will be spent at sea. <cite>The Azan</cite> will put in at several ports along the way, both to trade and to take on fresh supplies of food and water. Rimoah reminds you of the need for secrecy<ch.emdash/>nobody must know the real purpose of your journey. Jenkshi and his men have been told that you are simply a courier who is carrying official papers for the attention of Lord Zinair, the Dessian ambassador to Suhn. On arriving at Suhn you are to contact Lord Zinair who will arrange for your passage across the Sea of Dreams to the Isle of Lorn. Before you leave the Tower of Truth and return to your chambers, Lord Rimoah examines the satchel in which you carry the Moonstone. Its special korlinium lining meets with his approval.</p>

You would be wise to trust only yourself, Grand Master.</quote> (If you have not already done so, record the Moonstone on your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a> as a Special Item. You carry it slung over your shoulder in its leather satchel.)</p>
       <p>Rimoah escorts you to your room and tells you that he will call for you at an hour before dawn to take you to the quay. As he bids you goodnight, a doleful bell rings out in some distant part of the city. Rimoah<ch.apos/>s eyes fill with sadness.</p>
       <p><quote>What does the bell mean, my lord?</quote> you ask.</p>
       <p><quote>It signifies the passing of Lord Casis. He, too, is about to begin a journey. Alas, it will be his last. I must go now<ch.emdash/>I am being summoned to witness his departure.</quote></p>

       <p>When first you enter the mists, it seems as if you are no longer sailing upon a sea of water. It becomes a blended sea and sky of deep blue light, without horizon or boundary<ch.emdash/>a limitless space. Gradually you detect vague shadows passing quickly by, and then distant sounds, like muffled whispers, surging then pulsing away before you can catch the words. Then you see globes of darkness hovering to and fro, and your Kai senses scream a warning that these are invaders, evil intruders in this realm of ghostly mist. They grow in numbers and begin to spiral around your boat, whispering and laughing and babbling all the while. You can feel your boat gradually slowing until it ceases to move at all. Fear grips you when you realise that these mischievous black spheres have the power to hold you prisoner, to keep you from ever reaching the shores of Lorn. Suddenly the vague sounds and voices in your mind begin to crystallize into words that you can understand.</p>
       <p><thought>You have proved your physical courage, foolish follower of Kai. But now you must put your mental strength to the test if you wish to find the Isle of Lorn.</thought></p>

       <p>You fight your way to the surface of the churning sea and gulp a lungful of air. All about you are flailing lumps of debris, foaming bubbles, and treacherous strands of rope and canvas that threaten to entangle your limbs and drag you to your doom. Breathing hard, you fill your lungs and feed oxygen to your blood before diving deep below the flotsam of the dying ship. You surface beyond the debris and swim for the shore, now less than a mile distant.</p>
       <p>The waves bring you ashore upon a rocky beach where you crawl for shelter among boulders at the base of a chalk cliff. From here you see the wreck of the <cite>Vargas</cite> come drifting towards the shoreline to be smashed to pieces on the rocks. Gangs of men are pacing the beach, salvaging cargo and slaying any crewman who is washed ashore alive. They are wreckers, and your Kai senses tell you that they are led by an evil magician who possesses great power. You can feel the aura of his presence nearby, high upon the cliffs, and you know that he has been responsible for the wicked destruction of the <cite>Vargas</cite> and its crew.</p>
       <p>Using your Kai camouflage skills to keep yourself hidden from the wreckers, you hurry away along the rocky coast. During your escape, unless you possess the Discipline of Grand Huntmastery, you must eat a Meal or lose 3 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points.</p>

The innkeeper asks Melchar if his happy mood is due to a win at the derby. He tells him that, thanks to your advice, he did not bet and therefore he did not lose.

       <p>As the last of the thugs exhales his final breath and crashes to the ground, you make a cursory search of their bodies and discover the following items:</p>

        <li>2 Swords</li>
        <li>3 Gold Crowns</li>

Unlike at the warehouses and emporia of the quayside, the people who attend this market all appear to be natives of the city. As you pass by one stall you overhear two women talking about a place called Kitaezi. One of them insists that the whole city has been placed under a curse. You are about to turn back and ask them more about this city when suddenly you are approached by a tall woman who is swathed from head to foot in a fine blue robe. Anxiously she asks if you are a healer, and her piercing grey eyes continually dart to the satchel slung over your shoulder. It is as if she knows that you are carrying the Moonstone.</p>

       <p>Your Kai Sixth Sense tells you that she means you no harm. You sense that she is greatly troubled and, when you ask what is wrong, she says that her daughter, Harni, is gravely ill. She pleads with you to come and help her and, although you deny that you are a healer, you feel compelled to answer her desperate plea for help.</p>

       <p>You take your seats and the croupier deals out five cards to each player. Gregor wins the first round, and the second, and the third. Very soon it becomes apparent that he is quite an expert at Lourdenian Draw. After little more than a dozen rounds of play he has collected over 50 Nobles. For your part, you make use of your Magnakai Disciplines to help you win a more modest sum.</p>
       <p>Pick a number from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a>. If the number you have picked is odd (i.e. 1, 3, 5, 7, or 9), you win 4 Nobles. If the number you have picked is even (i.e. 2, 4, 6, 8, or 0) you win 6 Nobles (1 Noble = 1 Gold Crown).</p>
       <p>The other players become disgruntled and one by one they leave the table. Soon there are not enough players to be able to continue, and when no new players come forward the croupier declares the game closed. Grinning like a well fed cat, Gregor pockets his winnings and together you leave the Lucky Horse Inn and continue your walk along the main street. Soon you arrive at the Lourdenian Consulate where a guard at the gate allows you both to enter and wait in its cool, tree-shaded courtyard. A few minutes later you are met by the consul<ch.apos/>s assistant, a rotund little official called Cheary. He is shocked to hear of the pirate attack, and he urges Gregor to accompany him inside the consulate to make a full written report. He says that it could take several hours, possibly even a day or two, and so you decide that now is a good time to say farewell to your companion. Before you go, Gregor offers you his heartfelt thanks for all you have done for him, and he hopes that one day soon your paths will cross again.</p>
       <p><quote>If you should ever visit Pforodon,</quote> he says, <quote>stop by the Singing Lamb Tavern on Spike Street. If I<ch.apos/>m not there, the landlord will know where you can find me.</quote></p>
       <p>You wish Gregor a safe journey home, and then you leave the consulate and make your way back along the main street to the harbour. The heat and dust of the afternoon are making you thirsty and so you stop to drink from a freshwater fountain set into the wall of a crumbling old temple. The hustle and noise of the street crowd is becoming oppressive and you yearn to find somewhere quiet where you can rest before you return to the ship. Looking around, you notice two places which promise some respite. The first is a public park which stands upon a cliff that looms above the city to the east of the harbour wall. The second is a narrow, deserted alley that wends its way into the city<ch.apos/>s Old Quarter.</p>

       <p>Through the blinding glare of the sun<ch.apos/>s rays you see a procession of robed figures moving down the beach towards you. Tall and proud and enigmatically graceful, they each shine with a unique radiance that reveals the goodly power of their ancient arcane wizardry. Silently these Shianti encircle you and your senses become charged with a new vitality that instantly obliterates the fatigue of your long passage across the Sea of Dreams. (You may restore your <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points total to its original score.) Then one of the divine beings moves nearer and, when you look into his eyes, you see your own image reflected there in his mirrored pupils.</p>
       <p><thought>Welcome, Grand Master,</thought> he says without speaking, his lyrical voice forming the words in your mind. <thought>We have prayed for your safe arrival. We praise you for the skill and courage you have shown during your long and difficult voyage to our realm. Come with us, for now you may rest awhile. Your quest is done.</thought></p>

       <p>You climb the stairs to the foredeck and scan the horizon for signs of a pirate raider. Less than a mile away you can see a huge vessel with a purple mainsail sailing towards the strait. Captain Radyard appears at your side and he views the approaching craft through his telescope.</p>

       <p><quote>Weigh anchor!</quote> he orders. <quote>Unfurl all canvas. I want every ounce of speed she<ch.apos/>ll give us, lads.</quote> The captain<ch.apos/>s urgent orders stir the crew into a frenzy of activity. As they set about their duties, you ask Radyard what is wrong. Without taking his eye from his telescope he says:</p>
       <p><quote>That<ch.apos/>s Sesketera<ch.apos/>s flagship<ch.emdash/><cite>The Triasus</cite>. I<ch.apos/>d recognize her sails anywhere. That scoundrel must want you badly to have sent the pride of his battle fleet after the likes of us.</quote></p>
       <p>With all canvas lowered, the <cite>Seasprite</cite> cuts a rapid course through the glassy blue waters of Kastrow<ch.apos/>s Door. Yet <cite>The Triasus</cite> has the advantage and relentlessly she closes the gap until no more than 30 yards of water separate her from the <cite>Seasprite</cite><ch.apos/>s starboard beam. The Siyenese cajole and curse and wave their fists at their pursuers, but their bravado soon crumbles when they find themselves staring into the muzzles of a double row of wide-bored naval cannon.

       <p><quote>Surrender the Northlander to me, captain,</quote> he shouts, through a loudhailer, <quote>or I<ch.apos/>ll have my gunners blow your ship out of the water!</quote></p>

       <p>The natives are angry. They come running towards the river bank, screaming and slashing the air with their primitive weapons. Their leader shouts at you and, although his dialect is unfamiliar, you are able to understand enough to hear that the man you have saved from the river is a thief and a murderer. He escaped from the settlement last night during the rainstorm, and the leader is accusing you of being his accomplice and of helping him to escape. He says that the river gods have brought you back to their village to pay for your crimes. You attempt to protest your innocence but the leader refuses to listen. He confiscates all of your equipment, including your Kai Weapon, your Belt Pouch, your Backpack, and the satchel containing the Moonstone, and then he has his men march you away to their village where you are locked in a hut. Shouting through the closed door, he tells you that the village elders will meet tomorrow at noon to decide your fate.</p>
       <p>A few hours later you overhear two guards outside the hut and you are shocked to learn that the man you saved from the river has since been executed. They say that the elders of the village decreed that he should be weighted with rocks and thrown back into the water. You have no wish to suffer a similar fate and so you quickly set about finding a way to escape from this hut.</p>

       <p><quote>Thanks<ch.ellips/>for nothing,</quote> you say, as you walk out of the warehouse and return to the square. As you are looking around and wondering where next to go, you suddenly notice that there is something happening at the end of a street that leads away from the quayside. You decide to investigate and you soon discover that the street leads to a large courtyard. Here the women of Masama are selling their wares, spread out upon gaily-decorated market stalls. Unlike at the warehouses and emporia at the quayside, the people who attend this market all appear to be natives of the city. As you pass by one stall you overhear two women talking about a place called Kitaezi. One of them is insisting that the whole city has been placed under a curse. You are about to turn back and ask her more about this city when suddenly you are approached by a tall woman who is swathed from head to toe in a fine blue robe. Anxiously she asks if you are a healer, and her piercing grey eyes continually dart to the satchel slung over your shoulder. It is as if she knows that you are carrying the Moonstone.</p>

It rides the wave and emerges from the storm into calmer waters beyond. You thank Ishir that you have survived this ordeal, yet it soon becomes apparent that the storm is merely the prelude to an even greater threat to the ship<ch.apos/>s survival.</p>

Captain Jenkshi and his crew have also risen early to ensure that <cite>The Azan</cite> is the first ship to leave Zharloum this morning. Shortly before dawn they weigh anchor and turn the ship about, and by the time the sun crests the horizon, you are already more than a mile away from Zharloum harbour, riding the morning tide ahead of a bracing westerly wind.

As <cite>The Azan</cite> draws closer, you are able to see that a flag is hanging from a broken masthead which lies draped over the vessel<ch.apos/>s smouldering stern. It is a green flag with scarlet edging, surmounted by a large silver fish. The sight of this flag makes you swallow hard for it is identical to the flag that flies from the mast of <cite>The Azan</cite>. It is the flag of a Suhnese trader.</p>

       <p>When Captain Jenkshi and his men first see this flag for themselves, they become very anxious about what may have happened to the crew of this stricken vessel. Many of them have fathers, sons, and brothers who work Suhnese ships in these waters. They urge the captain to search for survivors and he grants his consent readily.</p>

       <p>Your heart misses a beat the instant you recognize the face of this unhappy young woman. It is Oriah, the highborn daughter of the Funtal of Fio Fadali, the runaway who travelled with you aboard <cite>The Pride of Sommerlund</cite> on its ill-fated voyage out of Barrakeesh. Ever since she was abducted in the mountain town of Kilij you thought it unlikely that you would ever see her again. Yet here she sits, alone and dejected in a hall that is overflowing with an abundance of riches.</p>
       <p><quote>Oriah?</quote> you whisper hesitantly, hardly daring to believe that it is really her. She raises her head and her eyes widen with shocked surprise when she sees you.

       <p><quote>Oh, Grand Master,</quote> she sobs, <quote>I never thought that I<ch.apos/>d see you again. How did you know that I was here?</quote></p>
       <p>You tell Oriah of what has happened since you arrived in Ghol-Tabras, and that you had no idea that she was here at all. She explains that after she was abducted by slavers in Kilij, she was sold to Sesketera who brought her here to his citadel. She is to be kept imprisoned in this hall until their wedding day, one month from now.</p>
       <p><quote>Let us escape from this place together,</quote> you say, but she shakes her head.</p>
       <p><quote>No, it cannot be. Sesketera is holding my friends. They are his hostages. If I leave the citadel before our wedding day he will put them to the sword. I cannot leave. But I know how I may help you to escape. Come, Grand Master, follow me.</quote></p>

       <p>Automatically your Magnakai Discipline of Nexus works to counteract the powerful narcotic that has been added to the food.

With the sound of the approaching footsteps growing ever louder in your ears, you take the Iron Key from your pocket and offer up a prayer to Ishir that it will open this door.</p>

You are expecting them to be pleased that you have saved one of their kinfolk, but as they come closer you are shocked by their unexpected response.</p>

       <p>You leave the Tower of Truth and pass along a wide stone ramp that gently descends to the great canal that encircles the city of Elzian. Few of the city<ch.apos/>s Vakeros natives are abroad at this early hour and the streets and avenues are empty and quiet. A warm mist wreathes the barges and ships that are moored along the canal bank and, in the pre-dawn twilight, these vessels take on a ghostly appearance.</p>
       <p>By the time you find <cite>The Azan</cite>, the sun has broken through the mist and the city is beginning to stir. Captain Jenkshi and the crew of the Suhnese trader are busily preparing their ship to sail, yet they immediately stop their work to welcome you and Lord Rimoah aboard. Jenkshi is a lean, yellow-skinned man with wide almond eyes and a small blunt nose. His slick black hair is tied in a knot atop his head in the Suhnese style, a fashion that is also favoured by all his crewmen. He orders one of his men to show you to your cabin at the prow, but before you go you bid Lord Rimoah farewell and thank him for all that he and the Elder Magi have done to aid your quest.</p>
       <p>By the time <cite>The Azan</cite> is ready to sail, the mist has vanished. Having inspected your cabin you return to the foredeck where you settle yourself in the sun and enjoy the ever-changing views of the lush farmlands and Vakeros settlements which border upon the canal. For 90 miles this waterway cuts a wide furrow through the southern jungle of Dessi. To the east the horizon is dominated by a solitary mountain, and you marvel at its snowy peak which is the steepest you have ever seen.</p>

       <p>From the cover of the bordering undergrowth you watch a crow-faced man in tattered black robes standing at the centre of this crowd. He is uttering the chilling chant. Before him, on a stone altar, there lies the decaying remains of a body encased in rotting swathings. Your Kai senses reveal to you that the robed man is a Kitaezi Shaman, an evil necromancer who has enslaved these natives with his power. You sense also that it is the same power that was used to create the creature that attacked and slew your horse last night.</p>
       <p>Suddenly the terrible sound of the chant ceases and the Shaman shrieks with rage. He points to where you are hiding and your heart sinks. He has detected your presence. He pounds the altar with his fist and to your horror, you see the decaying remains begin to shift and stir into life. The Shaman intones a dark spell and the grisly corpse leaves the altar and comes stalking towards you, its fleshless arms outstretched. Waves of psychic energy buffet your mind. They paralyse you and keep you from escaping. You summon your psychic Kai defences and break this powerful spell, yet it is now too late to turn and run from the Shaman<ch.apos/>s horror<ch.emdash/>it is almost upon you. Instinctively you reach to your satchel for you sense that the Moonstone is all that can save you from this creature<ch.apos/>s ghastly embrace. You pull open the flap to reveal the magical stone and the effect is devastating.</p>

       <p>Once you have been effectively subdued, the city watch round up the Suhnese and guard you all at spear-point until two horse-drawn wagons arrive to take you away to the city gaol. As you are herded aboard these foul-smelling carriages, your Weapons, Kai Weapon, and Backpack Items are confiscated and dumped into a wooden crate beside the driver<ch.apos/>s seat. (On your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a> mark each of these items with an asterisk [*] to indicate that they are no longer in your possession, but do not erase them at this time. Any Special Items you possess are allowed to remain with you.)</p>
       <p>At the officer<ch.apos/>s command the wagons move off at a speedy pace. After a few bruising minutes your wagon emerges from the gloomy streets and ascends a smooth ramp which passes through the daunting gate of Ghol-Tabras gaol. Above this gate flutters a flag which depicts a black serpent entwined around the blade of a silver scimitar. It is the personal emblem of Sesketera, the ruler of this city, a man not known either for his kindness or for his mercy.</p>

Your request is met by a torrent of shouts and coarse laughter from the drunken Eldenorans, yet the captain does as you ask; he releases his grip and lets the gasping crewman drop in a heap to the taproom floor. You motion to the others that the time has come to leave. Without a word they abandon their tables and move towards the door, pausing only to pick up their injured comrade as they go. With the threats and crude curses of the Eldenorans ringing in your ears, you walk away from the Three Capstans Inn and return to the harbour. The crew feel angry and frustrated by what has happened, yet they also know that your cool-headed intervention probably saved them from far worse treatment at the hands of the brutish Eldenorans, and for that they are grateful.</p>

You draw upon your Magnakai Disciplines of Huntmastery and Pathsmanship to help you choose the best route of escape and, to your surprise, in doing so you discover a secret panel in the wall at the head of the stairwell. You reach out and press a raised stud and the concealed panel slides open to reveal a narrow passageway beyond.

       <p>However, you decide to play along with their game. You raise your hands to give the impression that you are surrendering, and when they order you to return across the bridge, you pretend you do not understand. The axeman shouts to his accomplice who is hidden in the crevice. He tells him to stop pulling on the rope and he dutifully obeys. As the bridge ceases to sway, the axeman and one other walk across the bridge towards you. They stop just beyond sword reach and motion to you to lay down your Weapons and equipment. Slowly you lift the satchel off your shoulder. As the strap clears your head, you grip it tightly and take a swing at the axeman. The satchel catches him on the jaw and the weight of the Moonstone knocks him unconscious. His companion screams with anger and lunges at you with his sword, but you swiftly sidestep him and he loses his balance. With a fearful cry on his lips he falls over the side of the bridge and tumbles to his doom.</p>
       <p>Quickly you remount your horse and coax him across to the far side. Angry voices echo from the gorge behind you as you spur him to the gallop and escape along the jungle trail beyond the bridge.</p>

       <p>Oriah takes you to another antechamber where she opens a door concealed behind a hanging tapestry. A narrow torchlit passage lies beyond this door and together you follow it until you arrive at a domed alcove. Here Oriah touches the head of a marble statue and the alcove swivels open to reveal a balcony encircling a large hall. Peering over the parapet you see that it is the main entrance hall to Sesketera<ch.apos/>s citadel. Its polished stone floor lies some twenty feet below the balcony, and its doors are guarded by two impressive warriors. They are attired in gold armour which glimmers in the weak rays of sunlight that are now filtering into the hall through its stained glass roof.</p>
       <p><quote>Wait a few moments,</quote> whispers Oriah. <quote>They are the night guards. Dawn is breaking and soon their watch will be over. There is always a lapse before the morning guards come on duty. The doors will then be unmanned and you will be able to escape from the citadel without being seen.</quote></p>
       <p>Minutes later, just as she predicted, the warriors march away and leave the doors to the citadel unguarded. Oriah wishes you good luck, but as she leans forward to kiss you fondly on the cheek, a stern voice suddenly shatters the silence of the hall.</p>
       <p><quote>Oriah! What deceit is this!</quote></p>
       <p>You spin around and see a tall, broad-shouldered man clad in a high-necked robe of purple silk. He has emerged from an archway and he is standing near the parapet rail at the far side of the balcony.</p>
       <p><quote>Sesketera<ch.ellips/></quote> gasps Oriah. She snatches her hands to her mouth and then she swoons and faints. You catch her as she falls and you lay her carefully down upon the floor. Sesketera shouts for his guards until he notices that the hall below is empty. He curses their absence, and then he begins to move around the balcony towards you. He is unarmed<ch.emdash/>but not for long. He grabs a ceremonial weapon from a stand of armour and quickens his pace. As he levels this deadly spear at your chest you see that his eyes are filled with a blind, jealous rage.</p>

       <p>You magnify your vision and focus on the tangle of burnt timber and ash that lies heaped inside the ruined hut. You are unable to see anything clearly, but you sense that there is something lying buried there. You tell the elder of your discovery and you see a flicker of fear in his old eyes. He says that there is nothing in the hut that could be of interest to the dragon, but your senses tell you otherwise. They also tell you that he is lying.</p>
       <p>A group of villagers armed with long spears rush to the hut and attempt to stab the dragon. The creature roars at them and then flaps its leathery wings and begins to circle around the settlement once more. You slip away from your hiding place and hurry down to the ruins for you are determined to discover what it is that the dragon is seeking. Guided by your Sixth Sense, you uncover a bronze statuette from beneath the ashes. Then the dragon returns. It lashes out at the villagers with its clawed forelimbs and smashes their spears to matchwood. The men retreat in confusion and the dragon lands and settles itself beside the hut. You move to unsheathe your weapon but you freeze when suddenly the dragon speaks to you. The creature has the voice of a man.</p>
       <p>The dragon pleads with you for the return of the statuette, for he says that it will remove the curse that has changed his shape. Your Kai senses detect that the creature speaks the truth, and that he is not the evil bane that the elder and the villagers have led you to believe. You notice that the elder and his men have left their hiding places and are now running towards the hut. You focus on the elder and see that a strange transformation has taken place. He is no longer the frail old man that he was; his face has become younger and it is contorted with a savage rage. Your Kai senses detect an aura of evil that is chillingly familiar. It is identical to that which surrounded Ulonga the Shaman and you sense that he, too, is a necromancer. He orders his men to take aim at you with their bows and blindly they obey his command. The dragon urges you to escape with him while you are able, and hurriedly you rush forward to climb upon his back as the first volley of arrows comes whistling through the hut.</p>

       <p>The dragon lands at his lair in the mountains and folds his wings to allow you to climb down easily from his scaly back. Carefully you place the bronze statuette into his clawed hand and witness a wondrous transformation take place. Slowly the dragon shrinks and its body changes into that of a tall man with a proud and noble countenance. He introduces himself to you as Cresosa, the leader of the Rivorzha tribe who dwell on the eastern slopes of the Hulhuk Mountains. Unlike the villagers, Cresosa<ch.apos/>s people have resisted Ulonga<ch.apos/>s evil rule, even though their resistance has forced them out of their coastal villages to seek refuge in the mountains. The statuette has broken a curse placed upon Cresosa by Ulonga the Shaman, and now he is able to return to his people and lead them back to their abandoned homes.</p>
       <p>Before you say farewell, Cresosa offers you two Potions of Laumspur (each of these Backpack Items will restore 4 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points when swallowed after combat). He then gives you directions which take you back to the trail, to a place where a bridge crosses a steep-banked river. Your <a idref="map">map</a> tells you that this is a tributary of the River Ito, and you decide to stop here to rest until dawn before continuing your trek to Caeno on foot.</p>

Yet the captain does as you ask; he releases his grip and lets the gasping crewman drop in a heap to the taproom floor. You motion to the others that it is time to leave. Without a word they leave their tables and move towards the door, pausing only to pick up their injured comrade as they go. With the threats and crude curses of the Eldenorans ringing in your ears, you walk away from the Three Capstans Inn and return to the harbour.

       <p>The two-day voyage to Nhang passes swiftly and without incident and you arrive at the port early on the morning of the third day. The entrance to Nhang harbour is noted for its eighty fearsome stone statues, known as <quote>The Warriors of Nhang</quote>, which stand in two lines and form a double colonnade out into the sea. Their ferocious granite faces glare down at you unmercifully as the <cite>Embassage</cite> sails between them and docks at the quay.</p>
       <p>Before you disembark, Captain Leonghi warns you to be on your guard while you are in the city. The natives still harbour loyalties to the memory of Shasarak, and recent uprisings have led to the imposition of a dusk-to-dawn curfew. He advises you to go directly to the city of Tiklu and seek out his cousin Gemulkin. He, too, is a merchant captain and he regularly plies a trader between Tiklu and the Port of Suhn. Leonghi gives you a scroll (record this Special Item on your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a> as Leonghi<ch.apos/>s Scroll; you keep it in a pocket of your tunic). It is a letter of introduction which bears his seal, and in it he asks his cousin to take you to Suhn.</p>
       <p>You thank the captain for all his help and then disembark onto Nhang quay. You leave the port area and follow The Street of the Full Moon<ch.emdash/>the main thoroughfare which bisects the city and ends at its West Gate. Your first impressions of Nhang are mixed. The striking design and construction of its buildings amaze you, but the dismal mood of its natives and the large number of street beggars leave you with the feeling that the city could erupt at any time.</p>
       <p>You pass many hundreds of shops and they all appear dingy and uninteresting until you happen upon a triangular building, created by a fork in the road. It has no sign stating its business, but by the nature of the various goods displayed in its window you judge it to be an emporium.</p>

       <p>You meet with Melchar as planned, and after a meagre breakfast at the inn, you follow the crowds who are making their way through the streets to the Caeno racetrack. This magnificent establishment dominates the city<ch.apos/>s eastern quarter and it has provided the venue for this spectacular derby for more than a century. Unlike the famous horse races held in Slovia and Lourden, the Caeno Derby is run by guanza<ch.emdash/>large bipedal lizards that are bred and trained throughout the Southlands. Huge sums are bet on the big race and the owner of the winning guanza stands to collect a purse of 100,000 Nobles.</p>

Melchar is keen to bet on the favourite<ch.emdash/>Forlu-zhan<ch.emdash/>but he wants to view the other runners before placing his wager with Wrok the Bookmaker. Having satisfied himself that the favourite will win, he goes off to the betting ring while you stay at the enclosure and watch the guanza lope past. As Forlu-zhan passes by, your Magnakai Discipline of Animal Control tells you that something is wrong. You sense that the favourite has been drugged with a mild tincture of graveweed and that he will be incapable of winning the race. Quickly you hurry to the betting ring to stop Melchar placing his wager. He is about to hand over his money when you catch up with him and tell him what you know. Melchar cancels his bet and Wrok the Bookmaker glares at you with undisguised hatred. He signals to a group of his henchmen and swiftly they surround you both. The moment the race begins you and Melchar are grabbed from behind and manhandled out of the betting ring. Wrok<ch.apos/>s henchmen bundle you into a tack room below the public stands, but before they can lock the door, you draw your weapon and attack them.</p>

       <p>Your Kai senses alert you to danger as you draw closer to the burning wreck. You warn the captain and at first he is sceptical. Then he, too, senses that something is greatly amiss and he orders the crew to hoist the mainsail in order to reduce speed. His caution is soon rewarded when suddenly a Shadakine man o<ch.apos/>war breaks cover from between two rocky islets and comes surging towards <cite>The Azan</cite>. Jenkshi orders the crew to lower the mainsail once more and begin evasive action, but the wind is starting to change and this greatly hampers his escape plan.</p>
       <p>You magnify your vision and scour the prow and foredecks of the approaching ship. It is dressed with the scarlet sails of a Shadaki buccaneer vessel and it is sitting very low in the water. You hazard a guess that it must be fully laden with booty stolen from the hold of the burning trader. With the wind going against him, Jenkshi takes a calculated gamble. He orders his helmsman to steer towards a narrow channel between two nearby islets. He is hoping that his lighter craft will be able to pass through the shallows here and gain precious time while the heavier enemy ship will be forced to go around the isles to avoid running aground. It is a bold manoeuvre, and one that is made all the more dangerous when the enemy captain suddenly turns his vessel and runs it parallel to <cite>The Azan</cite>. To your horror you see that the Shadakine man o<ch.apos/>war is armed with deck cannons. As it gains on your ship you see clouds of white smoke and flame erupt all along its hull. Then seconds later you hear the rumbling roar of its cannons, followed closely by the terrifying shriek of its deadly ball and chain shot as it comes hurtling through the air towards your vulnerable ship.</p>

       <p>The woman leads you through the shabby streets of Masama to her house on the boundary of the town<ch.apos/>s wealthy quarter. It is a two-storey dwelling, modest in comparison to others nearby yet richly appointed, with servants, a stable, and a fragrant orchard of guyan trees. You are ushered upstairs to where a young girl lies in a darkened room. She has a fever and a sickly grey pallor that makes her look more than twice her age. You recognize at once that she is suffering from Mysua. It is a disease that is spread by swamp flies and is not uncommon among the jungle-dwellers of Shadaki.</p>
       <p>Using your Magnakai Curing skills, and aided by the presence of the Moonstone, you are able to neutralise the infection that has ravaged this young girl<ch.apos/>s body. Within a few hours her fever has disappeared and a healthy colour returns to her face. She shows every sign they she will make a complete recovery. Her mother is overjoyed and she thanks you repeatedly. She insists that you stay here as her guest and she provides you with your own room overlooking the river.</p>
       <p>Over a delicious evening meal prepared by her servants, you learn that her name is Tiosanna. She is the widow of a wealthy trader who was killed at sea when his ship was attacked and plundered by buccaneers. When her only daughter recently fell ill with fever, she feared she was going to lose her as well. She rarely goes to the market, yet a strange compulsion made her go today. She cannot explain, but the moment she saw you she knew that it was within your power to save her daughter<ch.apos/>s life.</p>
       <p>You retire early to bed and sleep soundly (you may restore 6 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points). When you rise at dawn, you are feeling fresh and eager to continue your journey to the Isle of Lorn. In appreciation for saving her daughter<ch.apos/>s life, Tiosanna gives you a horse. Gladly you accept her generous gift and you bid them both a fond farewell before you set off along <quote>The Dragon<ch.apos/>s Tail</quote><ch.emdash/>the name given by the natives of this region to the overland route from Masama to the city of Kitaezi.</p>
       <p>After consulting your <a idref="map">map</a> you estimate that it should take you no more than two days to reach Kitaezi. The weather has settled and the overland trail proves far smoother than its given name implies. By mid-afternoon you have covered more than 50 miles and you are pleased with your progress.</p>

       <p>On returning to Grooja<ch.apos/>s hut, you find Tolshi waiting there for you. He asks you to accompany him to the ship at once for the captain needs you to help with the repairs. It is as if your silent prayers for rescue have been answered. You thank the elder for the visit to the oracle, and his wife for her hospitality, and then you leave quickly with the helmsman.</p>
       <p><quote>The captain doesn<ch.apos/>t really need your help,</quote> confides a grinning Tolshi, as you make your way hurriedly through the hovels of Dlash-da Ralzuha towards its torchlit harbour. <quote>He just thought you<ch.apos/>d welcome an excuse for not having to stay all night at Grooja<ch.apos/>s flea-ridden shack!</quote></p>
       <p>On your return to the ship you thank the captain for sending Tolshi to rescue you, and to show your appreciation, you help the crew to patch the damaged hull. By first light the repairs have been completed and the cargo is then reloaded into the hold. Jenkshi gives Grooja and the natives some copper ingots as payment for their help, and then the crew cast off and catch the morning tide.</p>
       <p>For two days <cite>The Azan</cite> hugs the coastline as it sails a southerly course to Ghol-Tabras. The weather is kind and the ship makes good progress, enabling you to enter port shortly before dusk.</p>

       <p>The bridge continues to sway and you find it increasingly difficult to keep your horse from rearing up in panic. Suddenly a group of native bandits emerge from the jungle behind you and they gather around the entrance to the bridge. The tallest man is carrying an axe. He grasps one of the heavy ropes which anchor the bridge, and he raises his axe threateningly. Again you hear the voice echoing from the crevice, repeating its demand that you cast all of your possessions into the gorge.</p>

You sense that his illness is caused by his constant exposure to the vapours from dyes and potions that he keeps in stock. You offer to help cure him of his ailment and at first he is sceptical.

       <p>The crew are in good spirits by the time you arrive at the Three Capstans Inn. The owner, a pot-bellied man with an oddly childlike face, welcomes the Suhnese with open arms and he orders his son to be generous with the ale. The tavern has three taprooms which are all busy, but not overcrowded, and in each area there is a minstrel and a juggler to entertain the patrons. During the course of the evening you learn that these raucous performers are all members of the owner<ch.apos/>s family.</p>
       <p>The entertainments continue for most of the evening until the joyful mood is unexpectedly soured by the arrival of an Eldenoran crew, led by their boorish captain. These coarse, loud-mouthed thugs seem to delight in hurling cheap insults at the Suhnese. Stoically the crew ignore the abuse, quietly hoping that the Eldenorans will soon tire of goading them and leave, but then one of Jenkshi<ch.apos/>s men rails against a racial slur and in a moment of anger he yells at them to shut their foul mouths. For a few moments the tavern is filled with a deathly hush; then the Eldenoran captain lunges at him, grabs him by the neck, and lifts him one-handedly off his feet.</p>

You brace yourself for the rough passage, yet you are stunned by the sheer, breathtaking violence of the storm. It pounds the decks and lifts the hull clear from the water. As the ship lurches wildly, you are thrown across the aft deck to crash painfully against a splintered hatch cover: lose 6 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points.</p>
       <p>Through the blinding spray, you see the helmsman lose his footing and fall overboard. His cry alerts Gemulkin who battles his way bravely to the ship<ch.apos/>s wheel. To prevent himself from being swept overboard, he fixes his belt to the hub of the wheel and then he fights to turn his ship into a towering wave, to save her from capsizing. A mighty wave crashes against the prow and Gemulkin<ch.apos/>s courageous action saves the <cite>Vargas</cite> from being split it two. It rides the wave and emerges from the storm into calmer waters beyond. You thank Ishir that you have survived this ordeal, yet it soon becomes apparent that the storm is merely the prelude to an even greater threat to the ship<ch.apos/>s survival.</p>

       <p>You attempt to rally the Suhnese to fight, but they are unarmed and have no battle training. Quickly it becomes clear to you that, if you force them to resist the city watch, you will be condemning them to needless injury or death. Wary of this, you attempt to lure the Shadakine soldiers away into one of the houses. Unfortunately, your brave effort is short-lived. The City Guard pursue you and quickly overpower you by their sheer weight of numbers: lose 3 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points.</p>
       <p>Once you have been effectively subdued, the city watch round up the Suhnese and guard you all at spear-point until two horse-drawn wagons arrive to take you away to the city gaol. As you are herded aboard these foul-smelling carriages, your Weapons, Kai Weapon, and Backpack Items are confiscated and dumped into a wooden crate beside the driver<ch.apos/>s seat. (On your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a> mark each of these items with an asterisk [*] to indicate that they are no longer in your possession, but do not erase them at this time.

After a few bruising minutes your wagon emerges from the gloomy streets and ascends a smooth ramp which passes through the daunting gate of Ghol-Tabras gaol. Above this gate flutters a flag which depicts a black serpent entwined around the blade of a silver scimitar. It is the personal emblem of Sesketera, the ruler of this city, a man not known for his kindness or for his mercy.</p>

The eerie silence surrounds you for several miles further until your Kai hunting skills detect a faint noise. It drifts towards you from among the towering trees to the right of the jungle path. Cautiously you leave the trail and make your way towards the source of this solitary sound.</p>

       <p>Tzai<ch.apos/>s house is located in the centre of the city, opposite the main market square and its municipal buildings. It is a large dwelling and much of it is a warehouse given over to the storage of his goods. You are greeted by his family and he takes great delight in introducing them to you. You meet his brother Chinn, his wife Tuvei, his two teenage daughters Leadu and Leiga, and his young son Undai. His wife and children seem very pleased to have you staying as a guest, but his brother Chinn views you with suspicion. You can tell from his cold reaction that he does not think very highly of foreigners.</p>
       <p>Later you share supper with the family and you tell Tzai that tomorrow you will look for Captain Leonghi<ch.apos/>s cousin, Gemulkin. You hand him the scroll that the captain gave you and he passes it to his brother. He says that Chinn has many friends at the dock and he asks his brother if he recognizes the name. Chinn shakes his head tersely and barely glances at the scroll before handing it back. He then leaves the table and goes to his room. As you watch him leave, your Sixth Sense tells you that he knows Gemulkin very well.</p>
       <p>After supper, Tzai invites you on a tour of his warehouse. While you are looking at the hundreds of fascinating items that he sells, you suddenly hear shouting coming from outside in the main market square. A noisy mob has gathered to denounce Dhanchai, the city<ch.apos/>s mayor. They are demanding that Koogha, a former Shadakine warlord, be returned to power. The city militia arrive to disperse this unruly crowd, but a struggle breaks out and soon the two sides are fighting openly in the square. Suddenly the warehouse door bursts open and a dozen men armed with knives and clubs begin to loot the shelves. Then Chinn comes running through from the house, alerted by the noise. He is armed with a stave with which he attacks the looters. One of them knocks it from his hand and another grabs him from behind and pins his arms to his side. Tzai screams as a third looter advances towards his helpless brother with a knife in his hand.</p>

       <p>The celebrations go on throughout the night, but you are able to find a quiet place to sleep for a few hours before dawn breaks over this happy city. When you tell the people that you must leave and continue your journey south, they are saddened by the news. They want you to stay as their new chieftain, but you persuade them that they must choose a new leader from among their own tribe. Before you leave they provide you with a mule and some food (enough for up to 3 Meals).</p>
       <p>By mule you expect the overland journey from Kitaezi to Caeno to take no more than three days. It is a rough, pot-holed trail and yet your mule never once misses his footing or causes you to fall. During the afternoon of the second day you enter the foothills of the Hulhuk Mountains and see a plume of black smoke rising into the sky. It comes from behind a treeless ridge, less than half a mile from the trail. The sound of anguished voices can be heard on the wind and these cries prompt you to leave the trail and investigate. As you crest the ridge you see a small native village. Several of the huts are on fire and its people are trying desperately to save their livestock and quell the raging flames.</p>

       <p>Once outside the main doors, you hurry across a wide stone bridge that spans the dry moat encircling Sesketera<ch.apos/>s citadel. Ahead you can see a cobblestoned plaza which is flanked on three sides by municipal buildings and shops, and on its fourth side by barracks and stables. The sound of the alarm bell is beginning to awaken interest in the plaza. Faces peer from windows and you can see men running to and fro inside the barracks compound. Then the gate to the stables swings open and suddenly there appears a man on horseback. He is one of Sesketera<ch.apos/>s guards and he comes galloping towards you with a lance levelled at your chest.</p>
       <p>You skid to a halt and quickly focus on the rider<ch.apos/>s horse. Using your Magnakai Discipline of Animal Control, you command the horse to jump in the air. This has the effect of startling the horse and, in its confusion, it begins to buck and twist. The rider is thrown from his saddle and left sprawled unconscious on the ground. Now you use your Kai skills to calm the startled horse. As he settles down, you leap into his saddle and escape from the plaza at a gallop.</p>
       <p>The incessant sound of the alarm bell follows you through the early-morning streets of Ghol-Tabras. Even as you reach the entrance to the harbour, more than a mile from the citadel, you can still hear it echoing over the rooftops. You look back over your shoulder and see that you are being followed by a dozen riders. They are citadel guards and they have been ordered to stop you at all costs. As you gallop along the harbour wall, your heart sinks when you see that <cite>The Azan</cite> is surrounded by soldiers. You race past them before they have a chance to load and fire their bows, but you soon come to the end of the harbour wall where you are forced to a halt. The bridge which spans the harbour entrance is too narrow to cross on horseback and so you abandon your mount and hurry across it on foot. You are nearing its centre when you see a trading ship passing directly below. It is leaving the harbour. Suddenly an arrow pierces your cloak and makes you freeze in your tracks. The soldiers are firing at you and, to your dismay, you see that they have sealed off both exits from the bridge. As they begin to move towards you from each side, firing as they advance, you climb onto the parapet of the bridge and attempt to leap onto the deck of the passing trader.</p>

       <p>As you stagger to your feet from beneath the debris, you look along the main deck and see that brave Captain Jenkshi has taken over the helm. With grim determination he steers his battered ship relentlessly towards the channel. You see him cursing the enemy captain and shaking his fist defiantly at the villainous Shadakine gunners as their cannonballs whistle across the decks of <cite>The Azan</cite>; then a gust of wind fills the torn mainsail and the ship begins to pull away from the lumbering man o<ch.apos/>war. A second broadside falls wide of its mark, and Jenkshi<ch.apos/>s bold plan finally pays off when the enemy ship is forced to veer away for fear of beaching her hull in the shallows. The crew cheer loudly when they see her red sails falling away to the stern and <cite>The Azan</cite> is left alone to make a swift passage through the islet channel. You make your way along the debris-strewn deck to congratulate Jenkshi on his masterful display of seamanship. He accepts your praise and the cheers of his crew with a rueful smile, even though his skill and his coolness under enemy fire have undoubtedly saved the ship and the lives of all aboard. However, as the ship emerges on the far side of the islets, you soon discover that more than just Jenkshi<ch.apos/>s bravery will be needed if everyone aboard <cite>The Azan</cite> is to live to tell the tale of their deadly encounter with the buccaneers of Shadaki.</p>

       <p>You are awoken in the middle of the night by a hideous cry. Your horse is startled and terrified by this gruesome sound and he tugs frantically against his reins. Seconds later you are up on your feet, your keen eyes scouring your surroundings for some sign of the threat. Your Kai skills are alerting you to an imminent and deadly danger, a hidden enemy who possesses a strong magical aura.</p>
       <p>You unsheathe your Kai Weapon and crouch behind a boulder. Suddenly the air before you shimmers and takes form, causing you to gasp in disbelief. Something is growing out of the very darkness itself! You glimpse its misshapen head and hunched body; then its outline seems to waver. It flickers and sparkles, as if it is caught between two planes of existence. Suddenly there is a brilliant flash and a sparkling arc of energy leaps from the shimmering mirage to come speeding towards your face.</p>

       <p>Tolshi arrives unexpectedly at Grooja<ch.apos/>s hut. He asks you to return to the ship at once for the captain needs you to help with the repairs.

       <p><quote>The captain doesn<ch.apos/>t really need your help,</quote> says a grinning Tolshi, as you make your way hurriedly through the hovels of Dlash-da Ralzuha towards its torchlit harbour. <quote>He just thought you<ch.apos/>d welcome an excuse for not having to stay all night at Grooja<ch.apos/>s flea-ridden shack!</quote></p>
       <p>On your return to the ship you thank the captain for sending Tolshi to rescue you and, to show your appreciation, you help him and the crew to patch the damaged hull. By first light the repairs have been completed and the cargo is reloaded into the hold.

It grabs him by the throat and lifts him off the deck. You race across the slippery decking and unsheathe your Kai Weapon to strike the creature in the side. Callously the beast hurls Gemulkin into the sea and then spins around to face you. Your first blow opens a wound across its chest, making it shriek loudly. But it recovers in an instant and it lashes out at you to connect with your shoulder.

       <p>Fair weather returns and <cite>The Azan</cite> makes good speed as it crosses the jade-green waters of the Gulf of Tentarium. It is shortly before noon of the following day when the first glimpse of Zharloum is sighted by the lookout, and less than an hour later you find yourself sailing into the harbour of this grand city. Emerald pennants flutter from the towers and roofs of its sun-bleached houses, and crowds of industrious citizens throng its paved avenues and alleyways. This old Shadakine port has a long history of free and fair trading. It is many miles from the cities of Shadakine political power which lie to the south and, due to this fortunate fact, it has been spared much of the damage wrought upon this troubled land by a succession of ruthless and tyrannical rulers.</p>
       <p>The ship enters and docks at the harbour wall, close to the jetty of a warehouse which contains the iron and copper ingots that it will carry to Suhn. As the crew begin the task of loading the cargo aboard, you decide to go and explore this thriving city. But after little more than an hour the heat, hustle, and noise of the crowded streets becomes oppressive and you find yourself yearning for somewhere quiet to rest before you return to the ship. Looking around, you notice two places which offer the promise of some respite from the teeming crowds. The first is a public park which stands upon a cliff that looms above the city to the east of the harbour wall. The second is a narrow, deserted alley that wends its way into the city<ch.apos/>s Old Quarter.</p>

As they disembark, one merchant<ch.apos/>s small cart is overturned and his cargo is spilled onto the shore. The other merchants push past him, but you feel sorry for his plight and you help to calm his carthorse and retrieve his goods. He is very grateful for your assistance and he offers you a ride to Tiklu aboard his cart which you willingly accept.</p>

You tell Jenkshi, but he is greatly sceptical of your seamanship and he ignores your advice. He is more concerned about finding survivors than listening to your vague warnings of danger. Unfortunately, he soon has cause to regret his decision when suddenly a Shadakine man o<ch.apos/>war breaks cover from between two rocky islets and comes surging towards <cite>The Azan</cite>. Jenkshi immediately orders his crew to unfurl every last inch of canvas and take evasive action, but the wind is now beginning to change and this greatly hampers them as they struggle to carry out his orders.</p>
       <p>You magnify your vision and scour the prow and foredecks of the approaching ship. It is dressed with the scarlet sails of a Shadaki buccaneer vessel and it is sitting very low in the water. You hazard a guess that it must be fully laden with booty stolen from the hold of the burning trader. With the wind going against him, Jenkshi takes a calculated gamble. He orders his helmsman to steer towards a narrow channel between two nearby islets. He is hoping that his lighter craft will be able to pass through the shallows here and gain precious time while the heavier enemy ship will be forced to go around the isles to avoid running aground. It is a bold manoeuvre, and one that is made all the more dangerous when the enemy captain suddenly turns his vessel and runs it parallel to <cite>The Azan</cite>. To your horror you see that the Shadakine man o<ch.apos/>war is armed with deck cannons. As it gains on your ship you see clouds of white smoke and flame erupt all along its hull. Then, seconds later, you hear the rumbling roar of its cannons, followed closely by the terrifying shriek of its deadly ball and chain shot as it comes hurtling through the air towards your vulnerable ship.</p>

This is a huge charge and Jenkshi complains bitterly, but the sergeant merely laughs as his protests. <quote>Pay the fee or forfeit your ship, captain,</quote> he sneers. Jenkshi asks that he be allowed to pay tomorrow, so that he may sell some of his cargo to offset the exorbitant fee, but the sergeant shakes his head and refuses his request out of hand. <quote>The fee must be paid now,</quote> he growls, <quote>and in coinage<ch.emdash/>not cargo.</quote></p>
       <p>Reluctantly the captain pays the sergeant using every last Noble that he possesses, leaving him with no money to pay his crew or purchase fresh supplies of food and water in the morning. He tells the crew that he must sell some of the cargo to raise the money he needs. A sale must be arranged quickly for he cannot afford to stay in this harbour for more than a day. Jenkshi picks a handful of his best crew members and tells them to accompany him ashore to help him find someone who will be willing to buy his copper ingots. You offer to help him and he suggests that you take half his men and meet back at the ship at dawn. He tells you to accept no less than 8 Nobles per ingot. He also tells you of two places he knows where a buyer for copper may be found: the Flying Fish Tavern and Coppersmiths<ch.apos/> Hall.</p>

       <p>You set off along the shore, keeping the waters of the Gulf of Serpents in sight to help you gauge your progress. The jungle bordering this coast is teeming with wildlife yet you detect no sign of tribal inhabitants. After your encounter with the natives of Dlash-da Ralzuha, you decide that perhaps this is a blessing. You spend the first night encamped on the beach, and then you begin your trek early the following day.</p>
       <p>Fine weather, wild game, and an abundance of freshwater streams make your trek far easier than expected. On the fourth day you happen upon an ancient track that climbs into the hills and joins a newer trail. Your tracking skills reveal human footprints but your excitement wanes when you determine that they are more than six months old. Steadily the trail climbs higher into the hills until you lose sight of the gulf waters. As darkness approaches it begins to rain. Within an hour it has become a torrential downpour that turns the trail into a fast-flowing stream. It becomes impossible to continue and so you search for somewhere dry to spend the night. Your tracking skills lead you to a cave, but when you enter you realize at once that you are not the only creature seeking shelter here tonight. You see the glint of amber eyes at the rear of the cave and you detect growling, loud enough to be heard above the noise of the pounding rain. Your instincts tell you that there are two creatures lurking here in the recesses of the cave, and that they are both hungry, scared, and potentially dangerous.</p>

Unlike at the warehouses and emporia at the quayside, the people who attend this market all appear to be natives of the city. As you pass by one stall you overhear two women talking about a place called Kitaezi. One of them is insisting that the whole city has been placed under a curse. You are about to turn back and ask her more about this city when suddenly you are approached by a tall woman who is swathed from head to toe in a fine blue robe. Anxiously she asks if you are a healer, and her piercing grey eyes continually dart to the satchel slung over your shoulder. It is as if she knows that you are carrying the Moonstone.</p>

You race across the slippery decking and raise your weapon to strike the creature in the side. Callously the beast hurls Gemulkin into the sea and then spins around to face you. Your first blow opens a wound in its chest, making it shriek loudly. But it recovers and it lashes out at you to connect with your shoulder. The force of the blow knocks you sideways and sends you sliding across the slick deck to fall headlong through an open cargo hatch.</p>

       <p>You wake the following morning to find that the torrential rain has ceased. Lying in the mud at the mouth of the cave are several orange-shaped fruits which have been dislodged from the surrounding trees by the deluge. You soon discover they are edible and you enjoy some for breakfast before continuing your trek. (There are sufficient fruits for another 3 Meals.)</p>
       <p>The heavy overnight rains have transformed the hill track into a muddy ditch which makes the going difficult. Yet it is still the quickest way through this jungle territory and you stay with the track until it comes to the bank of the swollen River Ocka. There was once a bridge at this point, but your tracking skills tell you that it has been washed away during the night. You are about to set off along the bank in search of somewhere to cross when suddenly you hear a desperate cry for help. You turn and see a man being swept downstream by the river. His head is barely above the surface and you can see at once that he is near to drowning.</p>

       <p>You hurry with Lord Rimoah through the corridors of the Tower of Truth towards the sound of the tolling bell, until at last you arrive at a chamber located below its vaulted presidium. Gathered here are the members of the High Council. They stand in a circle around the cloaked body of Lord Casis which lies upon a bed of shimmering crystals. A cocoon of light encases his frail form, its pale luminescence shedding an uncanny glow upon the faces of the surrounding elders. Rimoah joins them and, as you observe this eerie scene, you recall Lone Wolf<ch.apos/>s teachings at the Kai Monastery.</p>

       <p>The Elder Magi are all that remain of the race of beings from whom all goodly magic stems. They were sent to Magnamund almost 10,000 years ago by the Gods Kai and Ishir to defeat Agarash the Damned, Naar<ch.apos/>s first champion, and they triumphed in their task. Yet, in a later age their numbers were decimated by a plague and the few thousands who survived this tragedy sought refuge here in Dessi. The Elder Magi have always aided Sommerlund and have been loyal and invaluable allies to the Kai. But now their ancient power is waning, and the few thousands who survived the Great Plague now number less than a hundred.</p>
       <p>Suddenly the bell ceases to toll and you watch in awe as the fragile remains of Lord Casis gradually fade from sight. He has ended his time here upon Magnamund and has passed over into the Plane of Light, the ethereal domain of the Gods Kai and Ishir. Silently the remaining elders file out of the chamber. As Lord Rimoah passes, he beckons you to follow him.</p>
       <p><quote>You are the first Kai who has ever witnessed the ascension of an Elder,</quote> he says, as he takes you back to your room. <quote>Alas, our power ebbs with each passing year, for this is the twilight of our existence here on Magnamund. Yet, we embrace our fate, for even as we weaken and fade so the power of the New Order Kai grows stronger. This is the dawning of your Age, Grand Master. You and your brothers shall carry forward the fight against Naar, and you shall be victorious.</quote></p>

Heavily muscled and sheathed in a glistening green skin, this nightmarish creature lands upon the main deck and glares at the terrified crewmen through slitted eyes. Its wings shrink and melt into its shoulders and from its fang-filled mouth there issues a chilling hiss. In the next instant, it springs among the stunned crew to wreak carnage with its razor-tipped claws. In their terror, many men throw themselves into the sea to avoid the beast<ch.apos/>s deadly talons.

The night is calm and clear, and the stirrings of a warm southerly breeze promise fine sailing for the following day. Yet despite these good omens you awaken next morning feeling ill at ease.

You crash down upon the creature<ch.apos/>s head, stunning it, and the force of your fall sends it reeling to the floor.</p>
       <p>Frantically you scramble to your feet and reach for your Kai Weapon to finish off the beast before it can recover. But to your horror you discover that your weapon is not at your side; it fell from your belt when you were swept off the ladder. You look around and catch sight of it sliding across the floor towards the bulkhead door.</p>

       <p>The shock of the unexpected blow knocks the air from your lungs and somersaults you down into the water. You draw upon your Kai skills to numb your pain and gather your senses and, as your vision clears, you discover that you are still in one piece. However, the satchel containing the Moonstone is no longer slung around your shoulder. The strap has broken and you glimpse the bag sinking towards a coral reef, five fathoms below. Suddenly you sense movement in the water and you twist around. Speeding towards you comes a marine monster; it is returning after having rammed you in the back. It resembles a gigantic crocodile, but one with a blunt-muzzled head and scales of dull grey horn. As it closes for the kill its great jaw swings open revealing a ghastly red maw lined with dozens of dagger-like fangs.</p>

I<ch.apos/>m honoured to make with your acquaintance. May I join you? The food here is indescribable<ch.ellips/>but it fills an empty belly.</quote> You welcome the young man to sit down and the innkeeper appears with your food. As you share your meal, you learn more about him and this region of Shadaki.</p>
       <p>Melchar is on his way home to Toran. He has spent the past six months studying in Tiklu at the workshops of a famous silversmith of that city. During his stay he also studied the history of this region. On hearing of your encounters at sea he tells you that the buccaneers of Shadaki are renegades from the remnants of a great fleet that was created by the Wytch-king Shasarak. Following the overthrow of their master, these renegades were banished to the wastes of the Sadi Desert by Grey Star<ch.emdash/>the Wizard Regent of the Free Peoples. However, the buccaneers have recently returned to prey upon the rich sea lanes, and their piracy has grown unchecked ever since Grey Star disappeared three months ago from his palace in the city of Shadaki. His court officials maintain that he is abroad on a quest to western Magnamund, but rumour is rife that he has been abducted by necromancers who wish for a return to the dark days of Shasarak<ch.apos/>s rule.</p>
       <p>Melchar asks what has brought you to this part of the world and you tell him simply that you are on your way to the Port of Suhn to meet with Lord Zinair of Dessi. On hearing this, Melchar says that he may be able to help you reach your destination.</p>

       <p>Tolshi the helmsman climbs out of the hatchway to the stern hold and he hurries over to the captain<ch.apos/>s side. He reports that the ship is holed below the waterline, close to the rudder, and that she is fast taking in water. Jenkshi inspects the damage for himself and immediately sets his crew to work at patching up the damage. They do their best with the materials available but still <cite>The Azan</cite> continues to take on water. Jenkshi estimates that the ship will stay afloat no more than three hours unless proper repairs are carried out, and he orders Tolshi to set a course for Dlash-da Ralzuha<ch.emdash/>the nearest port.</p>
       <p>You voice your fear that Shadakine pirates may already occupy this port, but Jenkshi laughs when he hears this.</p>
       <p><quote>If you knew Dlash-da Ralzuha like I do, you<ch.apos/>d know we have no cause to worry about running foul of any buccaneers there. It<ch.apos/>s a slum port. A rubbish dump. Its name means <quote>Junkyard of the Ralzuha</quote> and it certainly lives up to its name.</quote></p>
       <p>Your first glimpse of Dlash-da Ralzuha confirms everything Jenkshi has said about it. Its rust-red hovels and stinking shacks are grouped haphazardly around the rim of a natural stone harbour formed by a semicircle of black volcanic rocks. Flocks of vultures hover in the skies, swooping to feed occasionally on rafts of rotting debris which litter the shoreline.</p>
       <p>It is late in the afternoon and <cite>The Azan</cite> is listing alarmingly to starboard when at last she enters the stench-filled harbour of Dlash-da Ralzuha. It seems that the whole population of this derelict little port turns out to greet your arrival. For the natives it is something of a special occasion, for so rarely do ships ever visit their squalid harbour.</p>
       <p>Despite their wretched living conditions, the poverty-stricken tribal natives of Dlash-da Ralzuha give <cite>The Azan</cite> a warm welcome, and they seem genuinely eager to help Jenkshi and his crew with the repair of the ship<ch.apos/>s hull. Grooja, the port<ch.apos/>s oldest man and tribal leader, provides Jenkshi with fifty native men to help with the unloading of the cargo in order that the damaged section of the hull can be raised above the waterline. The captain sets them to work and he estimates that adequate repairs could be made overnight to enable the ship to sail on the first high tide tomorrow. The crew are pleased to hear this news. None of them want to stay in Dlash-da Ralzuha a minute longer than is absolutely necessary.</p>

       <p>The gaol of Ghol-Tabras was once the southern wing of a grand citadel built by Jublazh Khyr, the first emperor of Shadaki. Its cells are reputed to be among the most escape-proof of any in Southern Magnamund, especially those which are located below ground level in the dungeons of the old citadel. Upon arriving at the gaol, you and your companions are thrown into a communal cell on the second floor. However, as soon as the gaolers examine the Kai Weapon and equipment that they confiscated from you, they begin to think that perhaps you are something more than just a hapless curfew-breaker.</p>
       <p>An hour after you arrive, the door of the communal cell bangs open and six armed citadel guards burst in. They have come to take you away from the Suhnese and transfer you to a separate cell below ground level. Your destination turns out to be a damp, windowless chamber. It opens onto a torchlit corridor that is lined with rusting stands of armour. At the end of the corridor is a guardroom and, when you pass by this room on your way to the cell, you catch a glimpse of the wooden crate which contains your Weapons and equipment. It is being stored here. You are pushed into your dingy cell, and then the iron door is slammed shut and bolted. As you listen to the footsteps of the guards receding down the corridor, you vow that you will escape from this gaol before the night is over.</p>

       <p>Next morning you bid farewell to Tzai and his family before accompanying Chinn to the docks. Moored at a jetty by the old harbour wall is a sleek-prowed merchant trader called the <cite>Vargas</cite> that flies a Suhnese flag. Chinn takes you aboard this vessel and you meet with Gemulkin in his cabin at the stern. He is a wiry man with a hooked nose and close-set eyes that gives him an expression of sly cunning. Yet his voice is deep and resonant and you can tell that he is someone who is used to commanding respect. By way of introduction you present him with the scroll that his cousin gave you, and he smiles as he reads it.</p>
       <p><quote>If I had a Noble for every favour I<ch.apos/>ve done him over the years, I<ch.apos/>d be a rich man,</quote> he says, jokingly. Then he furls the scroll and places it in the drawer of his chart table (erase this item from your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>).</p>
       <p><quote>Welcome aboard, Journeyman. Pay no attention to my jest. I owe my cousin more favours than I care to remember. You<ch.apos/>re welcome to sail with us to Suhn on the noon tide. All I ask is that you work your passage.</quote></p>
       <p>You agree to Gemulkin<ch.apos/>s terms and shake his hand to seal the deal. He calls for one of his crew to come and show you to your bunk, but before you go with him you bid farewell to Chinn. He thanks you again, not only for saving his life but also for curing him of his distrust of foreigners.</p>
       <p>The <cite>Vargas</cite> sets sail on the noon tide. It is carrying a valuable cargo of silk, and Gemulkin is anxious that it should arrive safely in Suhn. He expects the voyage to last four days. During your first day aboard you help the crew with their duties and listen to their tales about the Sea of Winds. Gemulkin has ordered the crew to be especially vigilant on this voyage, for pirate raiders from northern waters have become more daring of late. The ships of the Freedom Guild patrol the Sea of Winds to deter buccaneers, yet they cannot guarantee safe passage to any ship once it passes beyond Shuri Point.</p>
       <p>On the morning of the third day the lookout sights Shuri Point in the distance. As the <cite>Vargas</cite> swings around this rocky cape, you see a storm brewing on the horizon. A cluster of black clouds hovers menacingly over the sea, discharging bolts of lightning that arc back and forth between the shore and the surface of the ocean.</p>

       <p>You count out five coins into her hand and in return she tells you that Lord Zinair resides in the city<ch.apos/>s North Quarter, at the Dessian Consulate. She writes the directions to the consulate on a scrap of parchment and gives this to you. Upon leaving her shop, you follow her written directions and arrive there within the hour. With mounting anticipation, you climb the front steps of the consulate building and knock on its stout oak door.</p>

       <p>As the man<ch.apos/>s head dips under the water for the last time, you dive into the muddy river and swim across its surging current. Guided by your Sixth Sense, you locate his body and then pull him to the surface. You fight to maintain your grip as the powerful current sweeps you downstream, and you are propelled along for more than a mile before it finally deposits you on the opposite bank. As you drag the man from the water, you notice a group of huts in the distance. You are about to haul the unconscious man over your shoulder and set off towards them, when suddenly you detect that he has no pulse. Using your Magnakai Discipline of Curing you are able to restart his heart and empty the water from his lungs, yet you are unable to restore him to full consciousness. The sudden sound of voices makes you look towards the huts where you see a group of natives pointing excitedly in your direction. They are all wearing jerkins and loincloths made from animal hide, clothing that is identical to that worn by the man you have saved from the river. You call to them and wave your arms to attract their attention and they quickly respond. You are expecting them to be pleased that you have saved one of their kinfolk, but as they come closer you are shocked by their unexpected response.</p>

       <p>Hurriedly you climb these stone steps and come to a landing where several corridors converge. Some are occupied by gaolers and other officials of Sesketera<ch.apos/>s citadel who are going about their duties. Then you hear the sound of footsteps ascending the spiral stairs behind you, and this sound reminds you of the pressing need to keep moving. You draw upon your Magnakai Disciplines of Huntmastery and Pathsmanship to help you choose the best route and, to your surprise, in so doing you discover a secret panel in the wall at the head of the spiral staircase. You reach out and press a raised stud and the concealed panel slides open to reveal a narrow passageway beyond. Quickly you enter this passage and the panel automatically clicks shut behind you.</p>

As they disembark, one merchant<ch.apos/>s small cart is overturned and his cargo is spilled onto the shore.

       <p>For two days you follow this shoreline which borders upon the Sea of Dreams. You feed upon the plentiful supply of marine life that you find at low tide in rockpools and caves, and you avoid the natives of the coastal villages through which you take care to pass only at night.</p>
       <p>During the morning of the third day you catch your first sighting of the Port of Suhn and your spirits rise. It sits upon an islet at the mouth of the River Azan, and it is a most welcoming sight. There have been many times during your long voyage south that you feared you might not live to ever see this city.</p>
       <p>You continue your trek and enter Suhn by means of a grand wooden bridge. It spans the Azan and leads directly to the harbour. You stop to admire the great harbour gate of Suhn. It is a magnificent arch that is decorated with likenesses of the heads of every ruler this city has known. You count 120 heads in all, the last in the line being that of the city<ch.apos/>s present ruler<ch.emdash/>Grey Star. The harbour is filled with low, wide boats, many with makeshift shelters, that rock gently on the tide. Native families crowd these vessels, their menfolk working long hours at the busy quayside and trading wharves nearby. Passing through the harbour you see several patrols of City Guardsmen who are heavily armed and quick to stop anyone they consider to be suspicious. There is an underlying sense of unease about the place, a tension that reminds you of Nhang. You decide it would be wise to avoid the City Guards and so you leave the harbour and go in search of Lord Zinair, the Dessian ambassador. Beyond the harbour gate you see that there are only two thoroughfares. One leads directly to Suhn<ch.apos/>s Market Square and the other, the Avenue of the Southern Seas, wends its way into the city<ch.apos/>s trade quarter.</p>

       <p>You climb a steep path which ascends to the cliff-top park, and when you arrive there you are rewarded by a spectacular view of the Gulf of Tentarium and the city streets below. The park is empty of people, except for a small group of men who are gathered around the remains of a stone statue which lies broken and overgrown with weeds. A plaque attached to the shattered base declares that it was once a likeness of Shasarak, the Wytch-king of Shadaki. He was an infamous necromancer who inflicted a reign of terror upon this land until finally he was defeated and his empire destroyed in the year MS<ch.nbsp/>5057.</p>
       <p>As you move nearer you see that the group is listening to the rantings of a bald man who is attired in grimy, tattered grey robes. His wild eyes roll in his cadaverous face as he tries to persuade his listeners to join with him in the overthrow of the city<ch.apos/>s ruling council. Between rantings, he offers them food from a large wooden bowl.</p>

After a mile or so, this rough track ascends into a wooded hillside and then ends upon a plateau which overlooks the harbour. From here you can see Jenkshi and his crew working on <cite>The Azan</cite> by the light of a hundred oily torches. With undisguised pride, Grooja points to the Shrine of the Oracle and invites you to avail yourself of its wisdom. The shrine consists of a man-sized statue constructed from rusting metal and chunks of driftwood held together with nails, strips of animal skin, and twisted steel wire. You decide to humour Grooja and so you ask the statue to tell you if there is anyone you should trust or distrust during your long journey to Suhn. As expected, you get no response. But then a wind arises and it makes a faint whistling sound as it passes through the holes in the statue. For a fleeting moment you think you hear the words: <quote><em>Bad<ch.ellips/>dragon<ch.ellips/>is good,</em></quote> but then the wind dies and there is nothing but silence. Grooja smiles. He seems to think that the oracle has spoken a great truth.</p>

On every other wall there hangs a gaudy yellow poster announcing the Caeno Derby, an annual race that attracts visitors from all over Magnamund. The race is to be run tomorrow and the inns and boarding houses are overflowing with customers. After a long search, you finally discover a shabby inn called The Song of the Silver Star that has a vacant room. The fat innkeeper informs you with glee that bed and board will cost you 6 Nobles, an exorbitant sum for such a run-down establishment.</p>

       <p>The man shrieks with rage and curses you in a vile language that you do not recognize. Yet the sound of his words sends a shiver of dread coursing down your spine, like a trickle of icy-cold water. He denounces you as an agent of the City Council sent to spy on their meeting, and he orders the group to attack and slay you. The men react slowly to his frantic commands. It is as if they are struggling to awaken from a deep sleep. You have no wish to fight these men and so you turn and run towards the park entrance to escape from them. As you reach the open gate, you glance over your shoulder to see that the bald man is preparing to hurl a dagger at your back.</p>

       <p>The villagers fire their bows and every arrow strikes the dragon, yet none of them penetrate the creature<ch.apos/>s scaly hide. You hold your fire until you have a clear shot at the creature<ch.apos/>s eye, which appears to be the only part of its body that is vulnerable to a missile. Your shaft comes close to its mark: it glances off the dragon<ch.apos/>s eyelid. The creature seems not to even notice your hit. It circles the village once more and then hovers above the burnt-out remains of the central hut. You watch the creature and your Kai Sixth Sense tells you that it has not come here bent on destruction. It is seeking something in the charred ruins.</p>

       <p>Night has fallen since you were first imprisoned in the hut and you are able to use the cover of darkness to avoid being seen. You are anxious to escape from this place but you are not prepared to leave without first retrieving the Moonstone, your Weapons, and your confiscated equipment.</p>
       <p>You allow your Kai Sixth Sense to guide you to where your Kai Weapon is being stored. It is a large wooden shack at the centre of the settlement, and it is occupied by the village elders. Soon the news of your disappearance prompts the leader to order a search. You stay hidden until the shack is empty and the coast is clear, and then you enter it by means of an open window. Inside you discover all of your confiscated equipment, as well as several other items which could prove useful during your quest:</p>
       <ul>
        <li>Bow</li>
        <li>6 Arrows</li>

        <li>Crystal Prism (Special Item)</li>
       </ul>
       <p>Having restored your equipment, you leave the shack and make your way into the jungle. Your Kai skills enable you to avoid the villagers and make a swift escape westwards into the hills.</p>

He has strong Sommlending features and the cut of his clothes tell you that he is a member of a guild from your homeland.</p>
       <p><quote>Well met, Master Kai,</quote> he says, offering his hand in friendship. <quote>I am Melchar, journeyman to the Silversmiths<ch.apos/> Guild of Toran. I<ch.apos/>m honoured to make with your acquaintance. Come, join me for a meal. The food here is indescribable<ch.ellips/>but it fills an empty belly. You look in need of food. Come, join me.</quote> You thank the young journeyman for his generosity and, as you share a meal, you learn more about him and this region of Shadaki.</p>
       <p>Melchar is on his way home to Toran. He has spent the past six months studying in Tiklu at the workshops of a famous silversmith of that city. During his stay he also studied the history of this region. On hearing of your encounters at sea he tells you that the buccaneers of Shadaki are renegades from the remnants of a great fleet that was created by the Wytch-king Shasarak. Following the overthrow of their master, these renegades were banished to the wastes of the Sadi Desert by Grey Star<ch.emdash/>the Wizard Regent of the Free Peoples. However, the buccaneers have recently returned to prey upon the rich sea lanes, and their piracy has grown unchecked ever since Grey Star disappeared three months ago from his palace in the city of Shadaki. His court officials maintain that he is abroad on a quest to western Magnamund, but rumour is rife that he has been abducted by necromancers who wish for a return to the dark days of Shasarak<ch.apos/>s rule.</p>
       <p>Melchar asks what has brought you to this part of the world and you tell him simply that you are on your way to the Port of Suhn to meet with Lord Zinair of Dessi. On hearing this, Melchar says that he may be able to help you reach your destination.</p>

Then you focus on the Eldenoran captain and launch a sharp pulse of psychic Kai energy at his head. He gasps, and then he lets the crewman fall to the taproom floor as the power of your psychic probe burns through his mind like a red-hot dagger.</p>

       <p>Using your advanced camouflage skills, you draw your Kai cloak tightly around yourself and stand close to the wall of the hut. Then you scream long and loud, as if in great pain, and wait for the guards to come. The door opens and two natives armed with spears step through into the gloomy interior. They fail to see you where you are and immediately assume that you have escaped. As they leave the hut to raise the alarm, you are able to slip out through the open door.</p>

Fearing for the safety of his cargo and crew the captain readily agrees and he orders his helmsman to bring the ship around. But as the <cite>Vargas</cite> returns towards Shuri Point, Gemulkin suddenly sees something on the horizon that makes him change his mind.</p>

When finally you enter the sanctuary of its crowded taproom, the young journeyman laughs with sheer relief at having escaped from the racetrack alive. The innkeeper asks Melchar if his happy mood is due to a win at the derby. He says that, thanks to your advice, he did not bet and therefore he did not lose. He also adds the real reason why he is feeling elated, and the innkeeper frowns.</p>

Emerald pennants flutter from its towers and the roofs of its sun-bleached houses, and crowds of industrious citizens throng its paved avenues and alleyways. This old Shadakine port has a long history of free and fair trading. It is many miles from the cities of Shadakine political power which lie to the south, and due to this fortunate fact it has been spared much of the damage inflicted upon this troubled land by a succession of ruthless and tyrannical rulers.</p>

       <p>After the ceremony, the Shianti show you some of the magical wonders of their island that have never before been seen by Man. You marvel at flowing rivers of jewels, fabulous flora, and species of exotic fauna that defy description. After your tour of this paradise isle you are allowed to rest awhile before you are escorted to your boat to begin your journey back to the Port of Suhn.</p>

You sense that your direction and speed are being controlled by the Shianti, for within minutes of casting off from the shores of Lorn, the bustling harbour entrance to the Port of Suhn suddenly appears from out of the swirling sea mist. A stiff breeze catches your sail and propels you towards the quayside where, to your astonishment, Lord Zinair is waiting to greet your valiant return.</p>
       <p>Congratulations, Grand Master. Once more you have proved your courage and resourcefulness. You have completed the quest entrusted to you by Lone Wolf and you have triumphed magnificently. The safe return of the Moonstone to the Shianti is a major victory in the war against Evil, but it is a war that is still yet to be won. Upon your return to the Port of Suhn you learn from Lord Zinair of a new and sinister threat to the fragile peace of your world. If you wish to confront this deadly threat and prove that you are truly a champion of the New Order Kai, then the nature of the challenge can be found in the next exciting <cite>Lone Wolf New Order</cite> adventure, entitled:</p>
