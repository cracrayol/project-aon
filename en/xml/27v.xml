   <p>The Claw of Naar is the evil wand of power used by Agarash the Damned during his ancient conquest of Magnamund. Legend held that it had been lost forever in the molten ruins of Naaros, but now it has resurfaced, and its dread return heralds a dawn of disaster for the peaceable nations of Magnamund. Your allies, the wise wizards of the Elder Magi, have the power and the means to destroy the accursed Claw. But they do not possess it. In <strong><cite>Vampirium</cite></strong>, you must venture into the hostile land of Bhanar and snatch the Claw from the clutches of the evil Autarch Sejanoz. Can you deliver the Claw safely to the Elder Magi<ch.ellips/>or will you be destroyed by the terrifying wrath of the vampire lord Sejanoz?</p>

     <p>It is spring in the year MS<ch.nbsp/>5085 and you are a Grand Master of the New Order of the Kai, the warrior <ch.eacute/>lite of Sommerlund.</p>

     <p>Thirty-five years ago, the First Order of the Kai was massacred by the Darklords of Helgedad, a host of powerful creatures sent by the evil God Naar to destroy the world of Magnamund. Lone Wolf, the supreme leader of your illustrious fighting order, was the only survivor of their attack upon the Kai. As a young initiate he stood amid the burning wreckage of the old Kai Monastery and vowed to avenge the slaughter of his comrades. Twenty years later he kept his pledge when alone he infiltrated the foul domain of the Darklords and destroyed the infernal city of Helgedad, the base of their evil power.</p>

     <p>With the destruction of Helgedad, chaos befell the Darkland armies who had, until then, been poised to conquer all Magnamund. Quickly, their disorder escalated into a mutinous civil war, allowing the Freeland Alliance armies of Magnamund time enough to recover and launch a successful counter-offensive. Against all odds, a swift and total victory was secured over the feuding armies of evil.</p>

     <p>Following the demise of the Darklords, peace reigned in your homeland of Sommerlund. Under the direction of Lone Wolf the ruined Monastery of the Kai was rebuilt and restored to its former glory, and a New Order was established. You are one of this new generation of Kai recruits. You were born in Sommerlund in the year MS<ch.nbsp/>5063, during the time of the war against the Darklords. When you were seven years old, you were sent by your father to the Kai Monastery. There, under the tutelage of Lone Wolf, you developed your martial skills and honed the special Kai abilities which lay dormant within you. Your skills were nurtured and sharpened to perfection by years of study and rigorous training. Your exceptional talents helped you to master all of the Kai and Magnakai Disciplines, and swiftly you rose through the ranks of the New Order to become one of only five who now hold the high rank of Kai Grand Master. It is an achievement that has brought great honour upon you and your family.</p>

     <p>In the year MS<ch.nbsp/>5077 your skill and courage were put to the test when an attack was launched upon the Kai Monastery during Lone Wolf<ch.apos/>s absence. By means of a Shadow Gate (an astral corridor between the physical world of Sommerlund and the many ethereal domains which lie beyond it), Naar sent forth a host of dragon-creatures to besiege the monastery and lay waste to all Sommerlund. He had chosen his time well, yet his evil plan was thwarted by the tenacious defence that you and your fellow warriors maintained until the siege was raised by Lone Wolf and the King<ch.apos/>s Army of Sommerlund.<footref id="tssf-1" idref="tssf-1-foot"/></p>

     <p>During the seven years since the defeat of his minions, Naar has sought vengeance upon the Kai. He commands many agents of evil upon Magnamund, and they wait quietly in the shadows for the chance to serve their fell master.</p>

     <p>You have recently returned to the monastery after successfully completing a dangerous mission in the Kingdom of Bor.<footref id="tssf-2" idref="tssf-2-foot"/> The vast underground realm of Bor is home to the Drodarin dwarves, the oldest allies of the Kai. Forbidden excavations in the lowest levels of the kingdom had awoken and released the Shom<ch.apos/>zaa<ch.emdash/>a supernatural creature entombed by Magnamund<ch.apos/>s earliest magicians, the Elder Magi, during their ancient war against Naar<ch.apos/>s legendary champion: Agarash the Damned.</p>

     <p>Lord Rimoah, speaker for the High Council of the Elder Magi, travelled with you to Bor aboard a wondrous flying ship called <cite>Cloud-dancer</cite> and, with his help, you were able to defeat the Shom<ch.apos/>zaa and save your Drodarin allies from destruction.</p>

     <p>Three months after you returned from Bor, Lord Rimoah came to the Kai Monastery aboard <cite>Cloud-dancer</cite>. His visit was unexpected and you sensed at once that something was wrong. Lone Wolf summoned you to his chamber where, with mounting dread, you listened to Lord Rimoah<ch.apos/>s account of events in Southern Magnamund that threaten to destroy the fragile peace of that continent.</p>

     <p>The Elder Magi had received word from King Karvas of Siyen that Autarch Sejanoz, the evil ruler of Bhanar, had secretly dispatched a squad of his Imperial Guards into the Doomlands of Naaros. At first, neither the King nor the Elders could fathom a reason why the Autarch had done this. The Doomlands are one of the most inhospitable regions in all of Magnamund, a barren wasteland of ash and cinders that once was the domain of Agarash the Damned. At its centre stood his mighty fortress-city of Naaros. Yet, following his defeat by the Elder Magi, all that remains of it now is a titanic chasm of molten lava and heat-fused rock.</p>

     <p>Fearing for the security of his southern borderlands, King Karvas sent a group of <ch.eacute/>lite Siyenese rangers into the Doomlands to spy on the Autarch<ch.apos/>s men in the hope of discovering their true purpose. When, after six weeks, nothing was heard from the group, the King and his court assumed they had perished. Then a few days later, Karvas received word unexpectedly from his missing men. They had tracked the squad of the Autarch<ch.apos/>s Imperial Guard deep into the Doomlands, and they had observed them excavating an unmarked burial mound near to the ruins of Naaros. And it was here that they were to witness a chilling discovery, for buried beneath the mound lay the Claw of Naar.</p>

     <p>The Claw of Naar is an ancient wand of power that was crafted by the evil God himself, and used by Agarash the Damned during his conquest of Magnamund. Legend held that it had been lost forever in the molten ruin of Naaros, but now it had resurfaced, and its return boded trouble for the peaceable nations bordering upon the Autocracy of Bhanar.</p>

     <p>The rangers reported that the Autarch<ch.apos/>s squad were returning to Bhanar with the Claw in their possession. Their chosen route would take them through the Southern Dammerdon Mountains and so the rangers went ahead to hide themselves in Sunderer Pass where they intended to await their arrival. Their plan was to ambush the squad in the narrow confines of the pass and steal away the Claw. However, the ranger leader was fearful that the power of the Claw might overwhelm his small group. He requested of his King that help be sent urgently. Karvas responded to his plea by seeking the aid of the Elder Magi, and upon hearing of the situation, Lord Rimoah readily agreed to assist.</p>

     <p><quote>In turn, Lone Wolf, I have come this day to ask for the help of the Kai,</quote> said Rimoah. <quote>We of the Elder Magi have the power and the means to destroy the Claw of Naar, but only when we have that accursed object in our possession. To secure the Claw will require skills and courage that only the Kai possess. And so, I come here seeking your aid, Supreme Master.</quote></p>

     <p><quote>It will not be an easy task,</quote> replied Lone Wolf, thoughtfully, <quote>but we have the advantage of both speed and surprise. Sunderer Pass is no more than a day<ch.apos/>s journey away by skyship.</quote></p>

     <p><quote>Aye,</quote> replied Rimoah, <quote>but we must depart this afternoon if we are to be certain of reaching the pass before the arrival of the Autarch<ch.apos/>s squad.</quote></p>

     <p>Lone Wolf slowly turned to face you. <quote>I am tempted to accept this challenge myself, Grand Master,</quote> he said, as he held you with his unblinking gaze. <quote>But, alas, I must attend a War Council tomorrow at the King<ch.apos/>s Court in Holmgard. Will you journey to Bhanar in my stead and help Lord Rimoah to capture the Claw of Naar?</quote></p>

     <p><quote>Yes, my lord,</quote> you replied, without hesitation. <quote>For the greater glory of Sommerlund and the Kai, I am proud to accept this task.</quote></p>

      <p>If you have completed any previous <cite>Lone Wolf New Order</cite> adventures, remember to choose an additional Grand Master Discipline and add <ch.plus/>1 to your basic <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> and <ch.plus/>2 to your basic <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> for each adventure you successfully completed (cf. <a idref="discplnz">Grand Master Disciplines</a>).</p>

    </footnotes>

    <data>
     <p>You keep a record of your adventure on the <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
     <p>During the years you have spent in training at the Kai Monastery, you have devoted yourself to further developing your fighting prowess (<typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ>) and physical stamina (<typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ>). Before you begin this <cite>New Order</cite> adventure you need to measure how effective your training has been. To do this take a pencil and, with your eyes closed, point the blunt end of it onto the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a>. If you pick a 0 it counts as zero.</p>
     <p>The first number that you pick from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> in this way represents your <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ>. Add 25 to the number you picked and write the total in the <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> section of your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a> (i.e. if your pencil fell on the number 7 in the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> you would write in a <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> of 32). When you fight, your <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> will be pitted against that of your enemy. A high score in this section is therefore desirable.</p>
     <p>The second number that you pick from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> represents your powers of <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ>. Add 30 to this number and write the total in the <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> section of your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a> (i.e. if your pencil fell on the number 8 on the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> you would have 38 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points).</p>
     <p>If you are wounded in combat you will lose <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points. If at any time your <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points fall to zero or below, you are dead and the adventure is over. Lost <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points can be regained during the course of the adventure, but your number of <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points cannot rise above the number you have when you start an adventure.</p>
     <p>If you have successfully completed previous adventures in the <cite>Lone Wolf New Order</cite> series (Books 21<ch.endash/>26), you can carry your current scores of <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> and <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points over to this adventure.<footref id="gamerulz-1" idref="gamerulz-1-foot"/> You may also carry over any Special Items, Kai Weapon, normal Weapons, and Backpack Items you had in your possession at the end of your last adventure, and these should be entered on your new <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
     <p><strong>Playing Tip:</strong> You may use a 10-sided die instead of the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> if you find it more convenient.</p>

       <p>It has long been the tradition of your <ch.eacute/>lite warrior caste to bestow a new name upon each young novice when they complete their first year<ch.apos/>s training at the Kai Monastery. Kai names are chosen by senior Kai Masters with the aim of reflecting the individual strengths and qualities of each novice.</p>
       <p>You may create your own Kai name for yourself, or you can generate a Kai name at random using the name tables below. To generate a Kai name, pick a number from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> and consult Table A. The name which corresponds to the number you have picked is the first part, or prefix, of your Kai name. Now pick a second number from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> and consult Table B. The name which corresponds to the number you have picked is the second part, or suffix, of your Kai name. Put the prefix and the suffix together and you have your own personal Kai name.</p>

         <p>After years of martial training and study at the Kai Monastery, and by the rigorous practice of the teachings of your illustrious mentor<ch.emdash/>Kai Supreme Master Lone Wolf<ch.emdash/>you have achieved the noble rank of Kai Grand Master Senior.</p>

         <p>Following in the footsteps of Lone Wolf himself, you have vowed that one day you will become totally proficient in all 16 of the New Order Kai Grand Master Disciplines. By doing so successfully you will share with Lone Wolf the responsibility, the honour, and the future glory of leading the New Order Kai as a Supreme Master.</p>

         <p>If this is the first <cite>New Order</cite> adventure you have undertaken, then your present rank is that of Kai Grand Master Senior. This means that you have mastered <em>five</em> of the New Order Grand Master Disciplines listed below. It is for you to decide which five Disciplines these are. As all of the New Order Grand Master Disciplines may be of use to you at some point during your mission, pick these five skills with care. The correct use of a New Order Grand Master Discipline at the right time could save your life. When you have chosen your five Disciplines, enter them in the Grand Master Disciplines section of your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>.</p>

         <p>Upon reaching the ultimate rank of Kai Supreme Master, Lone Wolf received as a reward from the God Kai many new skills and abilities. One of these skills was Kai Weaponcraft. Using his newfound mastery, Lone Wolf forged ten weapons of magical power in the armoury furnaces of the Kai Monastery. These magical weapons are reserved for the <ch.eacute/>lite of the New Order Kai who attain the rank of Grand Master.</p>

         <p>In recognition of your rank and achievement, you may choose your own Kai Weapon from the table below or, if you prefer, you can generate one at random. To generate a Kai Weapon, pick a number from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> and consult the first column. The magical Axe, Sword, or Broadsword which corresponds to the number you have picked will be your own personal Kai Weapon. Record this magical weapon and its unique properties in the Kai Weapon section of the <a idref="action">Special Items List</a>.<footref id="equipmnt-1" idref="equipmnt-1-foot"/></p>

         <p><strong>Example</strong></p>
         <p>Say you choose the number 1 from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a>, your Kai Weapon will be the Axe <quote>Alema</quote>.</p>

         <p>When using this Kai Weapon in normal combat you may add <ch.plus/>5 points to your <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ>. Each Kai Weapon has a unique property. When you use your Kai Weapon in combat against the type of enemy that matches its unique property, or use it at the optimum time or location, then you may add the higher bonus to your <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> (these bonuses are not cumulative).</p>

         <p><strong>Example</strong></p>
         <p>If you were to use <quote>Alema</quote> in combat against an undead enemy, you could add the higher bonus of <ch.plus/>7 to your <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ>. If you were to fight a living enemy using this weapon then the bonus to your <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> would remain at <ch.plus/>5.</p>

       <p>There will be occasions during your adventure when you will have to fight an enemy. The enemy<ch.apos/>s <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> and <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points are given in the text. Your aim in the combat is to kill the enemy by reducing his <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points to zero while losing as few <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points as possible yourself.</p>
       <p>At the start of a combat, enter your own and the enemy<ch.apos/>s <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points in the appropriate boxes on the Combat Record section of your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
       <p>The sequence for combat is as follows:</p>
       <ol class="paragraphed">
        <li><p>Add any extra points gained through your Grand Master Disciplines and Special Items to your current <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> total.</p></li>
        <li>
         <p>Subtract the <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> of your enemy from this total. The result is your Combat Ratio. Enter it on the <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
         <p>Example</p>
         <p>You, Grand Master (<typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> 32), are attacked in a forest by a pack of Wild Dogs (<typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> 31). You are taken by surprise and are not given the opportunity of evading their attack. You possess the Grand Master Discipline of Kai-surge to which the Wild Dogs are not immune, so you add 8 points to your <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ>. You also possess the Kai Weapon <quote>Ulnarias</quote>, so you add an additional 5 points to your <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ>. This gives you a total <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> of 45.</p>
         <p>You now subtract the Wild Dogs<ch.apos/> <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> from your own, giving a Combat Ratio of <ch.plus/>14 (45<ch.minus/>31=<ch.plus/>14). <ch.plus/>14 is noted on your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a> as the Combat Ratio.</p>
        </li>
        <li><p><a id="stage3">When you have your Combat Ratio</a>, pick a number from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a>.</p></li>
        <li>
         <p>Turn to the <a idref="crtable">Combat Results Table</a>. Along the top of the chart are shown the Combat Ratio numbers. Find the number that is the same as your Combat Ratio and cross-reference it with the random number that you have picked (the random numbers appear on the side of the chart). You now have the number of <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points lost by both yourself and your enemy in this round of combat. (E represents points lost by the enemy; GM represents points lost by yourself<ch.emdash/>Grand Master.)</p>
         <p>Example</p>
         <p>The Combat Ratio between you and the Wild Dogs has been established as <ch.plus/>14. If the number picked from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> is 1, then the result of the first round of combat is:</p>
         <ul>
          <li>You (GM) lose 3 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points (plus an additional 1 point for using Kai-surge. This loss is in addition to the loss suffered as a result of combat).</li>
          <li>Wild Dogs lose 9 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points.</li>
         </ul>
        </li>
        <li><p>On the <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>, mark the changes in <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points to the participants in the combat.</p></li>
        <li><p>Unless otherwise instructed, or unless you have an option to evade, the next round of combat now starts.</p></li>
        <li><p>Repeat the sequence from <a idref="stage3">Stage 3</a>.</p></li>
       </ol>

       <p>This process of combat continues until the <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points of either your enemy or yourself are reduced to zero or below, at which point that combatant is declared dead. If you are declared dead, the adventure is over. If the enemy is dead, you can proceed but with your <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points possibly reduced.</p>

         <p>During your adventure you may be given the chance to evade combat. If you have already engaged in a round of combat and decide to evade, calculate the combat for that round in the usual manner. All points lost by the enemy as a result of that round are ignored, and you make your escape. Only <strong>you</strong> may lose <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points during that round (such is the risk of turning tail and running away during combat!). You may only evade if the text of the particular section allows you to do so.</p>

         <p>If you are a New Order Kai who has attained the rank of Kai Grand Master Superior, you will now benefit from improvements to the following Grand Master Disciplines:</p>
         <dl class="paragraphed">
          <dt>Animal Mastery</dt>
           <dd><p>Kai Grand Master Superiors who possess this Discipline are able to deter predatory animals in the wild by exuding a scent which is repellent to them. In order for this improved Discipline to work effectively, a Kai Grand Master Superior must be aware of the species of predatory animal he/she wishes to deter. The scent can only be detected by the targeted animal.</p></dd>
          <dt>Assimilance</dt>
           <dd><p>Kai Grand Master Superiors who possess this skill are able to create a noise and project it up to 15 yards away from their location. The noise is akin to the rumbling sound of thunder and it can be used to distract or divert an enemy<ch.apos/>s attention. This improved Discipline requires a degree of preparation and therefore it cannot be used during combat.</p></dd>
          <dt>Astrology</dt>
           <dd><p>Kai Grand Master Superiors who possess this Discipline are skilled in the use of all mechanical devices designed to measure and/or observe the cosmology of Magnamund. Such devices include sextants, astrolabes, and orreries.</p></dd>
          <dt>Herbmastery</dt>
           <dd><p>Kai Grand Master Superiors who have this Discipline are able to purify water, thereby making contaminated or briny water suitable for consumption. Roughly two pints of water per day can be purified using this skill alone. This daily total steadily increases as a Grand Master advances in rank.</p></dd>
          <dt>Elementalism</dt>
           <dd><p>Kai Grand Master Superiors who possess this skill are able to condense pure water out of the surrounding air. This water can be made to fall as a fine spray or as a sudden deluge. It can also be made to fill any suitable container or receptacle. Using this skill, Grand Master Superiors can create the equivalent of one large bucketful of fresh water.</p></dd>
          <dt>Bardsmanship</dt>
           <dd><p>Kai Grand Master Superiors who possess this Discipline are able to utilize their musical skills to pacify an excited or hostile animal.</p></dd>

          <dt>Grand Weaponmastery</dt>
           <dd><p>Kai Grand Sentinels who possess this Discipline are, when physically parted from their Kai Weapon, able to detect its location.

          <dt>Astrology</dt>
           <dd><p>Kai Grand Sentinels who possess this Discipline are able to detect psychic residues left on an object by its owner.

          <dt>Herbmastery</dt>
           <dd><p>Through their knowledge and use of common plants, Kai Grand Sentinels who have this Discipline are able to make contaminated or rotten food fit for human consumption.</p></dd>

          <dt>Bardsmanship</dt>
           <dd><p>Kai Grand Sentinels who possess this Discipline are able to use their singing or playing to counter a hostile sonic attack. The effective use and range of this sonic defence steadily increase as a Grand Master rises in rank.</p></dd>

           <dd><p>Kai Grand Defenders who possess this Discipline are able to neutralize any poisonous toxins that may be present in organic materials such as plants, berries, and fruits. Through the use of this skill, the transformation of toxins can sometimes result in an increase in <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> and/or <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> when the previously poisonous matter is swallowed.</p></dd>
          <dt>Elementalism</dt>
           <dd><p>By using this Discipline, Kai Grand Defenders are able to summon up a dense, misty vapour to obscure themselves from both normal vision and infravision (night sight).

         <p>If you are a New Order Kai who has attained the rank of Sun Knight, you will now benefit from improvements to the following Grand Master Disciplines:</p>
         <dl class="paragraphed">
          <dt>Grand Weaponmastery</dt>
           <dd><p>Sun Knights with this Discipline are able to wield two-handed weapons (i.e. Broadsword, Quarterstaff, and Spear) with full effect using only one hand.</p></dd>
          <dt>Grand Pathsmanship</dt>
           <dd><p>Kai Sun Knights with this skill are able to repel at will all normal-sized insects within a radius of three yards. The range and number of insects so affected increase considerably as a Grand Master rises in rank.</p></dd>
          <dt>Deliverance</dt>
           <dd><p>Sun Knights who possess this skill are able to repair serious wounds sustained by creatures other than themselves. By the laying of hands upon the affected creature<ch.apos/>s body, a Sun Knight can cause an open wound (or other serious injury) to mend itself. The speed at which this healing process takes place increases as a Grand Master rises in rank.</p></dd>
          <dt>Telegnosis</dt>
           <dd><p>Sun Knights who possess this Discipline are able to communicate telepathically over great distances. Initially the range of this ability is approximately 100 miles, but this distance increases as a Grand Master rises in rank.</p></dd>
          <dt>Grand Nexus</dt>
           <dd><p>Sun Knights who possess Mastery of this Discipline are able to feign death. By placing themselves into a state of suspended animation, outwardly they are able to achieve all semblance of being truly dead. However, whilst in this state, the only sense that a Sun Knight retains is the ability to hear.</p></dd>
          <dt>Astrology</dt>
           <dd><p>Sun Knights who have this Discipline are skilled in the art of chiromancy<ch.emdash/>the ability to tell fortunes from the skin creases and patterns found on the palms of hands.</p></dd>
          <dt>Bardsmanship</dt>
           <dd><p>Sun Knights who possess mastery of this Discipline are able to use their musical skills to launch sonic attacks against any individual within audible range. The effect of a sonic attack is dependent upon the target creature<ch.apos/>s sensitivity to sound (i.e. a deaf creature would be unaffected by such an attack).</p></dd>
          <dt>Kai-alchemy</dt>
           <dd>
            <p>Grand Masters who have reached the rank of Sun Knight are able to use the following Brotherhood Spells:</p>
             <ul>
              <li><spell>Halt Missile</spell><ch.emdash/>This causes any projected or hurled missile (e.g. arrows, axes, crossbow bolts) which may pose an immediate threat to the life of a Sun Knight, to cease its flight and remain stationary in mid-air. The effect of the spell lasts for 2<ch.endash/>3 seconds, allowing the Sun Knight time in which to move away from the missile<ch.apos/>s line of flight. Initially only one missile can be affected by this spell, but the number increases as a Grand Master rises in rank.</li>
              <li><spell>Strength</spell><ch.emdash/>By casting this spell, a Sun Knight is able to greatly increase his or her physical strength for a short duration. It can be used to lift or move heavy objects, or to effect a temporary increase in <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> and <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> scores whilst fighting an enemy.</li>

         <dl class="paragraphed">
          <dt>Grand Weaponmastery</dt>
           <dd><p>Sun Lords with this Discipline are able to cause the metal edge of any non-magical weapon to ignite and burn fiercely. When a Weapon thus affected is used in combat, it inflicts an additional 1 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> point loss upon an enemy in every successful round of combat. This ability cannot be used with a wholly wooden Weapon such as a Quarterstaff.</p></dd>
          <dt>Herbmastery</dt>
           <dd><p>Sun Lords who possess this Discipline are able to cause living plants, e.g. grasses, bushes, flowers, weeds, rushes, to entwine themselves around the limbs of hostile creatures, thereby hampering their free movement. Sun Lords are able to target only one creature in this way. An additional creature can be affected for every level a Grand Master rises above the rank of Sun Lord.</p></dd>
          <dt>Assimilance</dt>
           <dd><p>Sun Lords who possess this skill are able to cause the outline of their bodies to become blurred and indistinct. By so doing, they can greatly increase their chances of avoiding magical and/or non-magical missiles directed at them.</p></dd>
          <dt>Grand Huntmastery</dt>
           <dd><p>Kai Sun Lords with this skill are able to see, with acute accuracy, light in the infrared spectrum, i.e. they can see the complex patterns generated by heat in near or total darkness. They can also see light in the ultraviolet spectrum.</p></dd>
          <dt>Kai-surge</dt>
           <dd><p>Sun Lords who possess mastery of this Discipline are able to launch a Kai-blast<ch.emdash/>a pulse of intense psychic energy which is capable of affecting both psychically active and inactive enemies. This form of psychic attack is very effective, more so than a usual Kai-surge, Psi-surge, or Mindblast. It can cause an enemy to lose between 2 and 18 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points in one attack. A Kai Sun Lord using Kai-blast determines the damage inflicted on an enemy by picking two numbers from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a>. These numbers should be added together (a <quote>0</quote> = 1) and the resultant total equals the damage inflicted. However, use of a Kai-blast will reduce a Sun Lord<ch.apos/>s <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points total by 4. It cannot be used in conjunction with any other form of psychic attack.</p></dd>
          <dt>Telegnosis</dt>
           <dd><p>Sun Lords who possess this Discipline are able to alter their body weight in order to walk successfully upon different kinds of surface, e.g. water, mud, lava, and quicksand. Time duration<ch.emdash/>and degree of surface difficulty<ch.emdash/>increases as a Grand Master rises in rank.</p></dd>

             <ul>
              <li><spell>Penetrate</spell><ch.emdash/>This increases the penetrative energy of any Arrow, or Arrow-like missile, launched by a Sun Lord.</li>
              <li><spell>Energy Grasp</spell><ch.emdash/>This spell enables a Sun Lord to discharge a powerful electrical force into anything he or she touches. It is similar in effect to the Brotherhood Spell <spell>Lightning Hand</spell>. It differs in that it is easier to control and channel the resulting energy. It also requires the actual touching of an object or enemy to effect the spell.</li>
           </ul>
          </dd>
          <dt>Bardsmanship</dt>
           <dd><p>Kai Sun Lords with this skill are able to direct their musical abilities to disrupt the structure of inanimate breakable objects, e.g. glass, ceramics, urns, flasks, causing them to explode violently.

     <p>Grand Master, you are about to embark upon a vital mission to deny Autarch Sejanoz the Claw of Naar, an ancient yet deadly artefact of evil. During your quest to distant Bhanar you will encounter many strong and cunning adversaries, and your mission will be fraught with danger at every turn, so remain on your guard at all times.</p>

     <p>Some of the material items that you find will be of use to you, but others may be red herrings of no real value at all. If you discover items during your mission, be selective in what you choose to keep. Pick your initial five Grand Master Disciplines with care for a wise choice will enable anyone to complete the quest, no matter how weak their initial <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> and <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> scores may be. Completion of previous <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> adventures (Books 1<ch.endash/>26) may be advantageous, but it is not essential for the successful completion of this <cite>New Order</cite> adventure.</p>

     <p>May the light of the Gods Kai and Ishir guide and protect you during your mission in the sinister realm of Bhanar.</p>

       <p>Within the hour, you find yourself standing beside Lord Rimoah at the deck-rail of the sleek flying ship <cite>Cloud-dancer</cite>, watching the Kai Monastery melt away into the distance as the craft soars into an azure sky. The weather is fresh and clear, and you are blessed with a strong tail wind that will assist your long journey south to the land of Bhanar.</p>
       <p>Rimoah has already charted a course for Sunderer Pass, and as his young Toranese crew attend to the running of the skyship, you settle back into the plush comfort of the captain<ch.apos/>s cabin and discuss with him the details of your mission. After a delicious supper, you retire early and rise late in order to be best prepared for the task ahead.</p>
       <p>By noon of the next day, you have already crossed the Tentarias and entered into Southern Magnamund. You spend much of the early afternoon standing at the bow rail, lost in your thoughts as an endless panoply of rolling hills and grasslands pass silently beneath <cite>Cloud-dancer</cite><ch.apos/>s gleaming keel.</p>
       <p>When the forbidding peaks of the Darkwall Mountains are sighted on the horizon, Rimoah takes charge of the helm and steers the skyship on a southeasterly bearing to avoid them. These mountains mark the northern boundary of the Doomlands of Naaros, and Rimoah is anxious to avoid this notoriously stormy region. Skilfully he navigates a course around the eastern boundary of the Doomlands until, late in the afternoon, you see the snow-capped tips of the Southern Dammerdon Mountains soar into view.</p>
       <p>Rimoah passes the helm back to his bo<ch.apos/>sun, and then he hurries to join you at the bow rail. <quote>Keep your eyes peeled, Grand Master,</quote> he says. <quote>Sunderer Pass is a narrow gorge. It<ch.apos/>ll be hard to spot from here.</quote> Aided by your ability to magnify your vision, you are the first one to see the tiny pass. Rimoah praises your keen sight and he signals to the bo<ch.apos/>sun to bring <cite>Cloud-dancer</cite> around to the southern slopes of the Dammerdons, to a place where the pass emerges from the mountain range. Here you notice a pale cross of sun-bleached boulders laid out on the dark, dusty ground. It is a sign Rimoah has been hoping for, and excitedly he calls for the bo<ch.apos/>sun to steer the skycraft towards it.</p>
       <p><cite>Cloud-dancer</cite> is brought to hover directly above the cross. You leave the rail and accompany Rimoah into a boarding cage located at the stern, and together you are winched to the ground. As the cage touches down, you push open its iron gate and step out. Your pulse quickens when suddenly you see four shadowy figures emerging from the surrounding rocks.</p>

       <p>You make a wide detour around the encampment before continuing your ride south. It is mid-afternoon when you see a settlement in the distance, one of many that can be found on the fringes of the Yua Tzhan province. As you are passing through this ragged plains village, you see a busy market in operation. The traders and their costumers stop to stare as you ride past; their eyes drawn by the unusual cut and colour of your tunics.</p>

       <p>Gildas points to a clothes stall that is heaped with simple straw-coloured robes, much favoured by these Bhanarian plains-dwellers. <quote>Maybe a wise purchase, Sir Kai?</quote> he mutters. <quote>I fear our tunics may arouse yet more suspicion the further south we venture.</quote> You nod in agreement and halt to ask the trader how much he wants for four of his robes.</p>
       <p><quote>One hundred and fifty Ren,</quote> he replies, breezily.</p>
       <p>The trader<ch.apos/>s price is the equivalent to 15 Gold Crowns. The rangers do not have any money, so if you wish to purchase these garments you must pay the full price.</p>

       <p>Your tracking skills tell you that this hut was abandoned by its owner earlier this morning. Its log stove is still warm, and a plate of food lies untouched on the table. You share out the food and dry your clothes by the stove. Sergeant Paviz keeps watch at the window in case a patrol should come by to search the hut.</p>
       <p>As midnight approaches, the enemy activity in Zuda decreases. Gildas suggests you should leave during the night to minimize risk of discovery; the darkness provides invaluable cover. You agree, and after midnight you set out for the town.</p>
       <p>Bhanarian soldiers are billeted in most of the shops and houses. You keep to the back streets to avoid the patrols, but every alley and avenue leads to the market square at the centre of the town, and you cannot avoid passing through this area. In the middle of the square a magnificent tent has been erected. High above flies a scarlet flag emblazoned with a gold tiger<ch.apos/>s head. This is Sejanoz<ch.apos/>s personal flag and it signifies that the Autarch is here in person. A dozen of his best soldiers guard his tent, and parked beside its entrance are two strange machines.</p>

       <p>The first is an elaborate shrine. It is fashioned from gold and jewels and has been crafted into the likeness of a tiger<ch.apos/>s head. Two huge ivory fangs protrude from its jaw and its jewelled eyes glow with a flickering scarlet fire.</p>
       <p>The second is a golden chariot. This vehicle has no team of horses to pull it, for it needs no animals to cause it to move. It is a sky chariot, powered by the same magical forces that enable <cite>Cloud-dancer</cite> to soar through the air.</p>
       <p>You are observing the shrine from the cover of a doorway when suddenly the head slowly rotates in your direction, and two pencil-thin beams of red light shoot from its eyes. You duck back, but it is too late<ch.emdash/>the shrine has detected your presence. The guards at the tent raise the alarm and a troop of Bhanarians come running from the doorway of a nearby hall.</p>

       <p>The rangers approve of your plan and they are eager to put it into action. Gildas and his men mount up and skirt around the copse in a wide arc until they are in position on the far side, within sight of the enemy<ch.apos/>s unguarded mounts. They take your horse in tow, for your plan is to rejoin them and make a speedy escape as soon as you have retrieved the Claw. Meanwhile, you approach the copse and halt within sight of the campfire. Only one of the Imperial Guardsmen is still awake, and although he has been posted to stand watch, you see that he is having difficulty keeping his eyes open. The squad leader is tossing and turning in his sleep, as if he is having a bad dream, and as you inch closer to him you fear that he could awaken at any moment.</p>

       <p>And with these words you leave the rangers and make your way to the steep gully where <cite>Cloud-dancer</cite> lay concealed before it was attacked. As you approach the ravine, your Kai tracking skills direct you towards a small metallic tube that lies hidden among the boulders.</p>
       <p>Hurriedly you scoop up the tube, flip open its hinged lid, and shake a rolled piece of papyrus onto your palm. On this scrap of material is a hastily written message from Rimoah, telling you that the Claw of Naar must not be allowed to fall into the hands of Autarch Sejanoz. He urges you to find and destroy it.</p>
       <p><thought>If this should prove impossible, you must take it to the city of Pensei. There you should make contact with Lord Ghadra, the Dessian envoy, and he will see to its destruction. He will also help you to return home to Sommerlund.</thought></p>
       <p>Having memorized its contents, you tear the scrap of papyrus into small pieces and swallow them to ensure that Rimoah<ch.apos/>s message will never be discovered by the enemy. Then you return to the mountain pass to rejoin Captain Gildas and his men.</p>
       <p>You inform them that Lord Rimoah has been forced to flee in order to save <cite>Cloud-dancer</cite> and his crew from the attacking horde. On hearing this they bow their heads in disappointment, fearing that they may never again see Rimoah, or their homeland of Siyen. Then you tell them about the message that Rimoah left behind and, despite their sadness, they each vow to help you capture the Claw of Naar.</p>
       <p>Suddenly Ranger Yalin shouts a warning: the flying creatures are returning. Hurriedly you take cover among the rocks and watch as they circle above the pass. Your Kai instincts tell you that these beasts cannot survive for long beyond the mountain borders of the Doomlands, and soon your suspicions are confirmed when you see them returning north to Naaros. When the last of the creatures has disappeared, you beckon Gildas and his men to follow you down onto the mountain trail. Here you discover the bodies of two Imperial Guards who were caught by the rockslide ambush and crushed to death.</p>

       <p>You inform Gildas and the others of your discovery, and tell them to rest awhile beneath the wooden bridge while you attempt to lure a distant group of stallions towards the stream. By the use of your Animal Mastery, you are soon able to entice four horses to approach the bridge. At first they are nervous, for they can detect the vile stench of the Doomlands<ch.apos/> dust which impregnates the rangers<ch.apos/> tunics. But they are also thirsty and they cannot resist the temptation of the sparkling stream.</p>

At your command, Gildas and the others emerge from beneath the bridge and each man chooses a stallion.

Two of the enemy warriors have been crushed by the deluge, and three others can be seen staggering away wounded. Most of the squad appear to have survived the rockfall and you cannot help but begrudgingly admire the swiftness of their reactions.

He is clutching the Claw of Naar in his right hand and you are determined to seize the chance to capture it before he can rally his scattered men. Swiftly you traverse the mound of rocks that now blocks the pass, and as you leap into the gully behind the squad leader, you draw your Kai Weapon in readiness to strike. Your adversary hears the slick swish of your weapon leaving its scabbard and instantly he spins on his heel. Shock blanches his sallow, moustachioed face and his almond eyes widen with alarm, but he quickly recovers his composure.</p>
       <p>He raises the mace-like Claw of Naar defensively and, with a terse laugh, he levels its taloned tip at your chest. There is a crackling hum of power and a bolt of black fire leaps from this evil artefact.

Two bloodshot eyeballs wobble atop stalks that protrude from its swollen head, and a vile-smelling green bile drips unceasingly from its gap-toothed maw.</p>

Then an arrow skewers the sleeve of his tunic, and he spins around and looses off the second flame-bolt in reply. It explodes among the rocks above and you hear Sergeant Paviz cry out in pain. The crackling hum of the Claw rises to an almost deafening pitch when the leader allows the supernatural weapon to recharge to maximum power. Turning towards the rocks that block the mountain pass, he points the Claw at the base and lets loose a third blast of dark flame which blows a big hole in the heaped debris. With a wild cheer, the Bhanarians race through the smouldering gap and make good their escape along the trail beyond.</p>

As you duck below one sweeping attack, he catches you in the back with a lightning-fast following strike. His needle-claws become embedded in your Backpack, and it is wrenched from your back when he sends you crashing headlong against the chamber wall: lose 2 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points. (You must now erase everything in your Backpack.)</p>

       <p>You draw upon your improved Discipline of Grand Huntmastery and focus your vision upon the advancing squad, but you cannot detect anything unusual there. It is not until you cast your eyes to the blanket of cloud above that you discover the cause of your disquiet. Hidden from plain sight, yet clear to your improved infravision, you see a host of flying creatures soaring overhead. The sight makes you swallow hard. They have lean and sinewy bodies that are studded with hundreds of spikes, and their slitted eyes emit a cold, bilious light.</p>
       <p>You warn the rangers of their presence and swiftly they take cover among the boulders, hiding themselves from above. Your swift action saves you from being detected by the winged beasts, but as the last of their number passes overhead, you witness something that makes your heart skip a beat.</p>

       <p>For over three hours you ride south across the rolling grasslands, guided on your way by your tracking skills and the light of a waxing moon. It is not until you see the outline of a derelict temple silhouetted on the crest of a ridge that you slow your pace and point your tired horse towards it. Upon reaching the ruined temple you discover that it stands beside a well brim-full with fresh water. You let the horses drink their fill, and as they recover their strength, you and your companions explore the ruin.</p>
       <p>The temple is empty and overgrown. Its only feature of note is an altar stone engraved with ancient designs. It is illuminated by a solitary stream of moonlight that filters down through a hole in the shattered slate roof. While the horses are resting, you take the opportunity to examine the Claw and, as you unfold its covering blanket on the altar, you find yourself both fascinated and repulsed by the intricacies of its evil design. The head of the Claw resembles a petrified vulture<ch.apos/>s foot, cast in a black metal that is flecked with shimmering scarlet specks. Its shaft is twisted, like a length of gnarled root, and it is perforated along its length with pea-sized hollows.</p>

       <p>Quickly you speak the words of the Brotherhood Spell <spell>Lightning Hand</spell> and raise your right arm. You point your outstretched fingers at the Autarch<ch.apos/>s helm and a crackling bolt of blue fire leaps from your fingertips. It strikes his helm, and the force of the impact makes him shudder. He releases his grip and the rangers fall limply to the floor.</p>
       <p>Then he turns to face you. <quote>Give me the Claw!</quote> he demands, his voice booming around the chamber. <quote>Give me the Claw and I shall spare all your worthless lives!</quote></p>

       <p>The old man thanks you for having lifted the curse that was placed upon him by the shape-changer. Your courageous act has not saved his life, but it has saved his soul from the clutches of Naar<ch.apos/>s fell servant.</p>
       <p><quote>I am<ch.ellips/>Juanphor,</quote> he says, struggling to speak his name. <quote>I am a Chai herbalist<ch.ellips/>from Zuda. I came to the Vanchou a year ago in search of rare herbs and I fell under the curse of the shape-changer.</quote></p>
       <p>The old man draws from the pocket of his robe a small pouch containing some powdered yellow petals, and a rusty red key. He insists that you keep them, as a gift for your kindness. <quote>The powder is Poghlam<ch.emdash/>it shall protect you from evil,</quote> he says in a whisper, <quote><ch.lellips/>and the key will open the door to my home in Zuda. It is called the Crimson Tower. Whatever you wish to take<ch.ellips/>it is yours.</quote></p>
       <p>You offer to carry the old man away from the forest but he refuses to leave. <quote>My days are numbered. I shall only be a burden to you. You must leave me and go. Do not delay<ch.ellips/>the shape-changer is approaching. I<ch.ellips/>can feel<ch.ellips/>her anger.</quote></p>
       <p>Your Kai Sixth Sense confirms that the old man is correct. The shape-changer is approaching the clearing, and you must leave immediately if you are to avoid another deadly confrontation with her.</p>
       <p>Reluctantly you bid farewell to this brave old man, and then you cross the clearing hurriedly and remount your horse. Gildas beckons you to follow as he and his rangers make good a hasty escape into the trees.</p>
       <p>(If you choose to keep the Poghlam and the Red Key, record them on your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a> as Backpack Items.)</p>

You continue to ride at a swift pace for you are anxious to put distance between your company and the Imperial Guards.

You are inclined to disbelieve that it is haunted, yet you do not relish the thought of riding through it. Then a sudden sense of unease makes you glance over your shoulder, and your heart skips a beat when you see a column of dust on the track less than 3 miles distant.

       <p>You are trying to think of a way to draw the soldiers away from the water<ch.apos/>s edge, when Captain Gildas comes up with a crude yet effective solution to the problem. He draws an arrow to his bow and picks off a lone Bhanarian soldier who is washing his tunic upstream. The luckless soldier topples into the river and is carried towards the bridge by the strong current. Lookouts on the bridge spot his body and they pass word to those along the river bank. As the body is swept beneath the bridge, they leave their canteens and their washing and go running along the bank in the hope of recovering his body downstream.</p>

       <p>There is a great deal of activity going on at the main entrance to the barracks. Columns of Bhanarian spearmen, clad in black quilted uniforms with wide silk leggings, go marching through its gate every few minutes with an almost clockwork regularity. You suspect that they are mustering in preparation for the arrival of the Autarch, although they seem too heavily armed to be gathering for ceremonial parade duties. You also catch sight of some Xanon, and you sense that these creatures were among those whom you fought at the ruins earlier today.</p>
       <p>You signal to Gildas and his men to follow as you skirt around the barracks and approach one of several smaller entrances that punctuate its northern flank wall. A line of wagons are parked here awaiting their turn to enter. While they wait, the drivers and their civilian helpers busy themselves by checking the food and provisions they are delivering to the barracks<ch.apos/> kitchens. One driver is struggling to recover the contents of a crate that has fallen from the tailgate of his wagon and broken open.</p>

Fortunately, the lead ball has passed cleanly through his limb without striking bone, and you are able to staunch the flow of blood and seal his punctured skin by the use of your Kai healing skills alone.

       <p>Marching along this passage comes a squad of the Autarch<ch.apos/>s Imperial Guard.

In the next instant, a solid projectile smashes into the wall behind you, spraying you with slivers of stone.</p>

       <p>Determinedly, you rise to your feet and draw upon your Magnakai powers of Animal Control to subdue the frightened horse. Your efforts are quickly rewarded; the lead stallion walks towards you and nestles his head apologetically against your shoulder. When you sense that all of the horses are calm, you call to the rangers to come out from under the bridge and take a look at their fine new mounts.</p>

       <p>Shortly after dark, you and your companions make your approach to the river bank a mile upstream from the stone bridge. The rangers have tied their ropes together to provide a length that will reach to the opposite bank. The plan is for you to swim across and secure the rope on the far side. The rangers will then follow you across, using the rope to prevent themselves from being swept away by the strong currents.</p>
       <p>You tie the rope about your waist and wade into the cold dark river. Then you strike out for the opposite bank, swimming diagonally upstream to counter its swift flow. You are halfway across when your rope snags on something below the surface. Furiously you tug at it but to no avail. Then you see a glistening mound begin to rise up from the water. Two slits open, revealing the pupils of two monstrous eyes. Then a wider slit appears below them, filled with jagged fangs. Your rope disappears into the corner of this ghastly maw, and as the mouth opens and closes, so you are pulled ever closer to these deadly fangs.</p>

       <p>As you approach the north gate you consult your Siyenese Compass, and its steady needle confirms that the Claw of Naar is here, somewhere, in this grand walled city. You and your companions pass through the arched gateway without challenge, and follow a broad lantern-lit avenue towards the city<ch.apos/>s main square. Many open-fronted shops line this thoroughfare, their display tables laden with goods to entice its citizens to part with their hard-earned Ren.</p>
       <p>Upon entering the main square, you notice that small crowds have gathered on each corner. They are reading proclamations which have been pasted upon the walls by the city<ch.apos/>s officials. Using your Magnakai Discipline of Pathsmanship, you are able to translate the Bhanarian script for the benefit of your companions. The posters declare that tomorrow shall be a holiday. This is to celebrate a visit to the city by Autarch Sejanoz himself.

       <p>For most of the day you ride across a seemingly endless expanse of grassland without once catching sight of the enemy you are pursuing. It is nearly dusk before your keen eyes detect a column of wood smoke on the horizon, rising vertically in the still evening air. You call the rangers to a halt and then magnify your vision to take a closer look at the source of the smoke. It rises from a small copse of trees and you suspect that the enemy have set up a camp there for the night. The smoke tells you that they are cooking food, confident in the false belief that they have safely outdistanced you and your companions.</p>
       <p>You inform the others of what you have seen before continuing your ride along the plains road. When you are within a mile of the copse, you leave the trail and dismount. Sergeant Paviz and Ranger Yalin are told to stay and hold the horses while you and the captain go forward to scout the enemy encampment.</p>
       <p>Together you crawl towards the copse, side by side, concealed by the approaching darkness and the waist-high grass. You are within 100 yards of the enemy campfire when Gildas makes a sharp intake of breath. You glance at him and your blood freezes when you see that his face is inches from a grey conda<ch.emdash/>a deadly Bhanarian plains snake. The serpent<ch.apos/>s neck is raised and its wedge-shaped head is drawn to strike at your companion<ch.apos/>s eyes.</p>

Dust lies thickly on the surfaces of every bookshelf, table, and chair. This chamber is well appointed, but it has lain neglected for more than a year.</p>

You cast your eye along its entire length and observe the three great forts of Xian, Kinani, and Jhung. The tall crenellated walls of Fort Jhung lie directly ahead and, as you speed near to them, you observe something else, something unexpected and greatly welcome, which makes your spirits soar.</p>

       <p>You force the doors back to allow enough room for a horse to pass through, and then you enter the stables and search the upper and lower floors. You discover seven horses and a mule, and tack enough to equip them all. Gildas uses his expertise to choose the best mounts, and you help the rangers to fit them with saddles and bridles. When the horses are ready to ride, you leave the stables and make your way to the South Gate. It is open, and its sleepy guards pay you no attention as you canter through its tall arch and depart the city. The road beyond passes through several outlying settlements before it begins a gentle climb into the Honah Hills.</p>

       <p>You see the fearsome figure of Autarch Sejanoz come stepping through the chamber<ch.apos/>s shattered window. He alights from the platform of his golden sky-chariot which hovers silently beside the tower. Sheathed from neck to toe in black and golden armour, this warrior stands an arm<ch.apos/>s length taller than you and your companions. A great tiger helm conceals his face and behind him swirls a voluminous scarlet cloak. Only his hands are visible and they seem strangely at odds with the grand scale and design of his armour. They are withered and twisted like claws, the skin wrinkled and cracked like burnt parchment. Hanging over them are four long, curved, needle-like claws of steel that sprout from the back of the golden bracers which encase his wrists.</p>
       <p>Gildas and his men reach for their bows and fire repeatedly at the Autarch, yet every arrow they send against him ends shattered. From the visor of his helm there issues a thin, chilling laugh: <quote>You cannot kill me with your sharpened sticks, you fools!</quote> Upon hearing this, Paviz and Yalin drop their bows and unsheathe their blades. Paviz shouts a much practiced cue, and together they attack the Autarch, striking simultaneously from either side.</p>
       <p>With stunning swiftness, Sejanoz retaliates. He reaches out and grabs each man by the throat with his cadaverous hands, and raises them several inches from the floor. With a series of metallic clicks, the needle-claws extend and turn inwards, puncturing their jugular veins. Their faces blanch as their blood is drained, and not a drop is spilt.</p>

       <p>Shortly before midnight, you approach a toll bridge that traverses a deep gorge. The entrance to this bridge is blocked by a single-pole barrier, and on either side of the obstruction are painted wooden shacks, adorned with flickering lanterns. The soldiers who guard this bridge are awoken by the sound of your horses<ch.apos/> hooves. Fearing you to be a surprise inspection by their commanding officer, they grab their spears and stumble out of the shacks. As they draw themselves up in an untidy line before the barrier, their corporal raises his hand, commanding you to halt.</p>

       <p>The tiger<ch.apos/>s-head flag of Autarch Sejanoz now flies over Zuda. This border town has been overrun by his army within the last 24 hours. At first you suspect that this could be the start of a war between Bhanar and Chai, but your Kai senses tell you that this is no ordinary military operation. This army has come here for one purpose<ch.emdash/>to ensure the recovery of the Claw of Naar.</p>

       <p>You hold sombre council with the rangers and try to determine how best to proceed from here. <quote>I propose we try to reach the Chai Wall,</quote> says Gildas, and his men readily agree. Having never heard of this edifice, you ask Gildas to explain. <quote>The Chai Wall is a line of forts and military defences that lies 60 miles to the east of Zuda,</quote> he says. <quote>Invasion from Bhanar has long been a threat to Chai, but its ancient ruler<ch.emdash/>Khea-khan Xo<ch.emdash/>had remarkable foresight. He constructed a formidable wall to deter Autarch Sejanoz from invading his peaceful realm. It has served Chai well for many centuries.</quote></p>
       <p>You thank Gildas for this history lesson, but you question its accuracy. <quote>I was taught at the Kai Monastery that the reign of Khea-khan Xo was more than a thousand years ago. Surely his enemy then was not the same Autarch Sejanoz who rules Bhanar now?</quote></p>
       <p><quote>Ah, but he is!</quote> replies Gildas. <quote>Sejanoz has ruled this land for 3,000 years. Legend says that he entered into a pact with Agarash the Damned. In return for his soul he received<ch.ellips/>immortality.</quote></p>
       <p>As you look upon the flag of Autarch Sejanoz fluttering high above the buildings of Zuda, a growing sense of foreboding creeps upon you and it leaves a chill in your blood.</p>

       <p>Instinctively you reach for the hilt of your Kai Weapon, but Rimoah stays your hand. <quote>Hold, Grand Master. These are not our enemies<ch.emdash/>they<ch.apos/>re our friends.</quote></p>
       <p>The four gaunt, grey, grime-encrusted figures leave their hiding places and move slowly towards the cage. It is not until their leader smiles and reveals his white teeth that you realize they are human. The many weeks that these Siyenese rangers have spent in the hell of the Doomlands have exacted upon them a heavy toll.</p>

       <p><quote>Greetings, Lord Rimoah,</quote> says the leader. <quote>I am Captain Gildas of the King<ch.apos/>s Ranger Regiment, and these are my men<ch.emdash/>Sergeant Paviz, Ranger Durasso, and Ranger Yalin. We<ch.apos/>re glad you<ch.apos/>ve arrived before the enemy, though by no more than a few hours at best.</quote></p>
       <p>Captain Gildas looks at you and bows his head reverently. <quote>We<ch.apos/>re honoured by your presence, Sir Kai. I was lucky to be in Seroa last year when Karvas was crowned King, and I witnessed your knighthood in the Palace Square. We Siyenese will be forever in your debt for ridding us of that usurper<ch.emdash/>Baron Sadanzo.</quote></p>
       <p>You thank the Ranger Captain for his compliment and tell him that you have come here with Lord Rimoah to help capture the Claw of Naar. <quote>It is vital that Sejanoz be denied the Claw,</quote> you say earnestly, <quote><ch.lellips/>at all costs.</quote></p>
       <p><quote>Fear not, Sir Kai,</quote> he replies with confidence. <quote>We have laid a trap to ensnare the enemy and their foul relic. They<ch.apos/>ll not get out of Sunderer Pass. Come, we shall show you what we have prepared, but first you must conceal your skyship before the enemy arrive. Look over there, Lord Rimoah,</quote> says Gildas, pointing to a distant ravine. <quote>That gully is deceptively deep. It will swallow your ship without trace. You must hide it there. But first, may ask a favour?</quote></p>
       <p>Rimoah nods in reply.</p>
       <p><quote>Our provisions are exhausted. We have some water, but we<ch.apos/>ve had nothing to eat for days. Can you spare some food before you depart?</quote></p>
       <p><quote>Of course, Captain,</quote> replies Rimoah. <quote>I<ch.apos/>ll have the bo<ch.apos/>sun drop provisions this instant.</quote></p>
       <p>Rimoah climbs into the boarding cage and is winched up to the rear deck of <cite>Cloud-dancer</cite>. Within minutes, the cage descends once more, laden with food and water. With a gleeful cry, Gildas throws open the cage door and he and his men leap upon the provisions like ravenous wolves. What little they fail to consume immediately they stow away in their empty backpacks for later.</p>
       <p>As <cite>Cloud-dancer</cite> moves off to seek cover in the distant ravine, Captain Gildas leads you to the mouth of Sunderer Pass and shows you the preparations that he had his men have made in readiness to ambush the enemy squad.</p>

       <p>You retreat before the advancing Imperial Guardsmen until your backs are pressed against the base of the crimson tower. Gildas calls for you to look behind, and when you glance over your shoulder, you see that there is a red door set flush into the tower wall. Forcefully you push the door but it will not open. Then you notice a dial set in the middle of its surface, and in the centre of the dial is a small keyhole. The rangers load their bows and fire repeatedly at the advancing guardsmen as you attempt to unlock the door to the crimson tower.</p>
       <p>The dial is surrounded by numerals numbering from 0 to 100. Using your Magnakai Discipline of Nexus, you determine that by turning the dial to one of these numbers, you will cause the lock to disengage and the door will open.</p>
       <p>While examining the dial, you recall the wall safe in the barracks at Yua Tzhan. That lock required 3 digits to open it. This requires only one. The number that will open this lock is equal to the total you get when you add together the three digits that opened the wall safe.</p>

       <p>Thinking that you are provisioners from one of the other wagons, the driver is glad to accept your offer to help gather up the vegetables that lie strewn across the paved street. The raised hoods of your robes help keep your faces in shadow, and he fails to recognize that you are not native Bhanarians. Then one of the iron doors in the northern wall creaks open, and a barracks guard barks an order to the waiting drivers to begin delivering their loads by hand. A collective groan arises from the line of parked wagons, but for you and your companions it proves to be a perfect opportunity to enter the barracks undetected.</p>
       <p>Each of you takes a box of provisions from the rear of the wagon and joins in the line of drivers as they file through the iron door. You follow this line to a kitchen store room, located near the middle of the barracks complex, where you deposit your delivery and then return to the street to collect another box. As you are making your way back, you pass a door that your Kai senses tell you is unlocked. Quickly you slip inside and then signal to your companions to follow. When all of you are safely inside, you close the door and draw its bolt.</p>

       <p>You are dismayed that your attempt to destroy the Claw has failed, yet you refuse to abandon all hope of ridding your world of this evil artefact. You resolve to deliver it to the Elder Magi, for you know that it is within their power to obliterate this weapon of darkness.</p>
       <p>Captain Gildas consoles you, and from a pocket of his tunic he produces a small crimson gemstone which he cups in his palm, inviting your inspection. Without saying a word, he fixes this gem into one of the hollows in the shaft of the Claw, and then he hands you a seemingly ordinary compass.</p>
       <p><quote>Look at the compass needle, Sir Kai,</quote> he says, and he picks up the Claw and begins to walk. As he circles around you, the point of the needle follows his every move.</p>
       <p><quote>It<ch.apos/>s a Siyenese tracker-gem,</quote> he says. <quote>The needle of the compass is tuned to its vibrations. It<ch.apos/>s just a precaution, in case you should be parted from the Claw before you deliver it to the Elder Magi. So long as the gem remains embedded in its shaft, you<ch.apos/>ll be able to track it using the compass.</quote> Gildas hands you the Claw and you compliment him for his prudence.</p>
       <p><quote>A very wise precaution, Captain,</quote> you say, as you slip the compass into your tunic pocket. <quote>Somehow I feel sure that we have not yet seen the last of the Autarch<ch.apos/>s squad.</quote></p>
       <p>(You can record the Siyenese Compass on your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a> as a Special Item. You should also record the Claw of Naar as a Special Item. You must discard two items in their favour if you already have the maximum number of Special Items permissible.)</p>
       <p>You sheathe your Kai Weapon and follow Gildas as he returns to the horses. As you walk towards them, Ranger Yalin beckons you over to look at a strange shrub that is growing near the ruins.</p>

She twitches and wriggles uncontrollably, and, before your disbelieving eyes, her body begins to change. Her marble-smooth skin becomes criss-crossed with a net of a thousand wrinkles and her abdomen swells like an over-inflated balloon. Then there is a terrible sound, like the rending of bone and flesh, and suddenly the illusion of her beauty is dispelled forever when this fell vampiric shape-changer reverts to its true form.</p>
       <p>Confronting you now is a leprous horror with a huge, fang-filled maw. It roars with anger and a gust of its putrid breath wafts over you, turning your stomach with its vile stench. The rangers and their horses are snapped out of their hypnotic trance by the sound of its fearsome cry and, gripped by a sudden panic, they turn and flee into the trees. Hurriedly you follow them, forcing your mount to battle its way through a tangle of barb-toothed briar in your desperation to escape from the wrath of this demonic creature.</p>

       <p>You inch open the door to witness a fight taking place on the far side of the mess hall. The Bhanarians have abandoned their feasting and are now attempting to storm the archway. Four of their number lie dead or wounded on the ground, hit by ranger arrows. Your companions are putting up a brave fight, but they face the danger of being surrounded on both sides and trapped in the corridor.</p>
       <p>Then a new threat to their survival arrives. Three Bhanarian guards enter the hall pushing a strange, cannon-like contraption towards the distant archway. Fixed above its barrel is a large iron cylinder. It is studded with heavy rivets and fitted with a springed valve that bubbles and hisses like an angry serpent. You surmise this device is a steam-powered cannon, and you fear that if it is fired along the corridor it could slay your companions with one blast. As the Bhanarian gunners begin loading their weapon with handfuls of rusty nails and lead shot, you know you must find some way to stop them from firing this devilish device.</p>

Columns of Bhanarian spearmen, clad in black quilted uniforms with wide silk leggings, go marching through its main gate every few minutes with an almost clockwork regularity. You suspect that they are mustering in preparation for the arrival of the Autarch, although they appear too heavily armed to be gathering for ceremonial duties. You also catch sight of some Xanon, and you sense that these creatures were among those whom you fought at the ruins earlier today.</p>

When seven of these army transports converge upon the main gate at the same time, it creates chaos for the Gate Guards.

Hurriedly you dismount and corral your horses in a corner of this site before drawing your weapons in readiness to confront the approaching Xanon.

As you watch their approach, your Sixth Sense detects that these fearsome creatures have been spawned by evil sorcery.</p>

Fearful that these determined creatures could overwhelm your position if they chose to attack simultaneously, you command Gildas and the rangers to abandon their positions and escape to the east.

       <p>The corporal orders you and your companions to turn back. When you do not obey his command immediately, one of the bridge guards steps out of the line and jabs Captain Gildas in the ribs with the haft of his spear. The captain retaliates by kicking the guard in the shoulder, sending him spinning to the ground. A brawl ensues, and despite your best efforts to stop it, it quickly deteriorates into an all-out fight.</p>

       <p>Beyond the door you discover a narrow passage that leads to a flight of stone steps. You check your Siyenese Compass and then you lead the rangers up the stairs to a wider corridor on the floor above.</p>
       <p>You instruct Gildas and his men to wait at the top of the stairs while you make sure the way ahead is clear. Tall arched windows march past on either side as you approach a door at the end of the passageway. You detect the aroma of roasting meat and hear the sounds of feasting, and when you peep through the door<ch.apos/>s keyhole, you see a soldiers<ch.apos/> mess hall beyond.</p>
       <p>Carefully you twist its spherical handle and push open the heavy oak door just a few inches. Peering around the door, you see a dozen Bhanarian soldiers sitting at a large table set before a blazing log fire. A side of beef is roasting on a spit above this fire, and the soldier<ch.apos/>s plates are heaped high with meat and vegetables. Stands of antique armour are positioned around the walls of the hall, and its panelled ceiling is decorated with the portraits of famous Bhanarian generals of old.</p>
       <p>Some of the soldiers dining here are Imperial Guards from the squad that you encountered in Sunderer Pass. You scrutinise their faces, yet you cannot see their leader among them. Your Siyenese Compass indicates that the Claw of Naar is nearby; its needle is pointing to a door on the far side of the mess hall. You sense that the Claw is in the room beyond this door, and you resolve to find a way of reaching it without being seen.</p>

       <p>You watch with mounting fear as the horde of winged creatures circle and dive repeatedly into the ravine. They are met by intermittent flashes of magical energy which illuminate the gloom; Lord Rimoah and his young crewmen are putting up a spirited defence of their grounded skyship.</p>
       <p>Then you see an unexpected sight: <cite>Cloud-dancer</cite> rises out of the gully and ascends rapidly into the darkening sky.

       <p>When the squad of Imperial Guards catch sight of <cite>Cloud-dancer</cite> fleeing eastwards, their leader raises his hand and signals his men to advance. Using your enhanced vision, you focus on the leader and your Kai senses reel at the aura of evil surrounding him. You sense that this power does not emanate from him directly; it flows around a mace-like weapon which he carries sheathed in his belt. It is the Claw of Naar, and even at a distance its malignant power fills you with unease and foreboding.</p>
       <p>With bated breath, you watch the Autarch<ch.apos/>s men come marching along the narrow trail. Captain Gildas gives the signal to Durasso to spring the ambush, and the ranger tugs hard on the rope in his hands. There is a moment of silence; then a thunderous rumble reverberates through the mountains. A billowing cloud of thick dust engulfs the trail and you lose sight of the squad as a thousand tons of rock and rubble cascade towards them.</p>

       <p>You take the opportunity to get some sleep while the storm continues unabated. Gildas wakes you shortly after dawn and you peer out of the cottage window to see that the rain is now no more than a fine drizzle. You mount up and return to the road, but soon you discover that the way south is impassable. The road has been blocked during the night by the debris of a torrential mudslide.</p>
       <p>Reluctantly, you are forced to abandon your horses and set off across the hills on foot. During your trek, you discard your plains-herder robes for they offer no protection from the rain. At noon you halt to prepare a meal of roots and wild vegetables. While you are eating, you resolve to attempt to cross the River Heng and enter the friendly realm of Chai. Once you are across the border, you will make your way to the city of Pensei, and try to make contact with the Dessian envoy<ch.emdash/>Lord Ghadra.</p>
       <p>Despite difficult terrain you make good progress. You leave the Honah Hills and enter the dark pines of the Angfeng Forest, covering 30 miles by sunset. As darkness casts its black shroud upon this untamed land, you stop to set up camp for the night on the fringe of a cold marsh. The night sky is clear, and before you settle down to sleep, you take time to observe the stars.</p>

Then you return to the mountain pass to rejoin Captain Gildas and his men, but upon arriving there you discover that his ambush has failed. Gildas triggered a rockfall to block the pass, but the Autarch<ch.apos/>s men used the Claw of Naar to blow their way through the resulting obstruction. In the ensuing fight, Ranger Durasso was killed and Sergeant Paviz was wounded in the shoulder. You use your Kai healing skills to numb the sergeant<ch.apos/>s pain, and then you scan the trail leading south from the pass for signs of the enemy squad.

You also tell him of the message that Rimoah left behind. Then you hear Ranger Yalin shouting a warning: the flying creatures are returning. Hurriedly you take cover among the rocks and watch as they circle above the pass. Your Kai instincts tell you that these beasts cannot survive for long beyond the mountain borders of the Doomlands, and soon you see them returning north to Naaros. When the last of the creatures has disappeared, you beckon Gildas and his men to follow you down onto the mountain trail. Here you discover the bodies of two Imperial Guards who were caught by the rockslide ambush and crushed to death.</p>

       <p>You magnify your vision and see that the approaching figures are Bhanarians. Armed with swords and spears, they are all clad in black quilted tunics edged with gold braid and emblazoned with the tiger<ch.apos/>s-head emblem of Autarch Sejanoz. They are clearly a unit of Imperial Guards from the Autarch<ch.apos/>s court in Otavai. As the squad of twelve guardsmen draws nearer, your Kai Sixth Sense tells you that something is wrong. These are <ch.eacute/>lite soldiers of the Autarch<ch.apos/>s personal bodyguard, yet they seem to have forgotten basic military practice: they have placed no scouts at the head of their squad to check that the way ahead is clear.</p>

You point your outstretched fingers towards the closing doors and a crackling bolt of blue fire leaps from your fingertips.

His companion slams shut one door, blocking half of the doorway, but there is still space enough for you and your companions to make good your escape into the street beyond. As you gallop through the narrowed exit, you steer your horse to the right and race away along a cobblestoned street.</p>

       <p>Gildas nudges you and points to a rickety table that is heaped with simple straw-coloured robes, much favoured by Bhanarian plainsmen. <quote>These may be a wise investment, Sir Kai?</quote> he mutters. <quote>I fear our tunics may arouse suspicion the further south we venture.</quote></p>
       <p>You nod in agreement and ask the old man how much he wants for four of his robes.</p>
       <p><quote>One hundred and sixty Ren, kind sir,</quote> he replies, cheerfully.</p>
       <p>The old man<ch.apos/>s price is equivalent to 16 Gold Crowns. The rangers do not have any money, so if you wish to purchase these garments you must pay the full price.</p>

       <p>Sejanoz approaches the fire and stoops to retrieve the Claw, but then he hesitates. His skeletal hand trembles and he seems powerless to control it. You sense that he is afraid of the flames: it is his one vital weakness.</p>
       <p>You rush towards him and land a kick to his side, toppling him over. Before he can rise again, you grab the haft of the Claw and tug it from the fire. A burning log is skewered upon its tip. It flares brightly when you thrust it at the Autarch<ch.apos/>s helm and he rolls away, towards the shattered window. You follow up and jab it at his hands, and he shrieks with fear. Then he tries to stand, and as he is levering himself up from the floor, you leap into the air and land a two-footed kick to his chest that sends him somersaulting backwards. With a wailing cry, he tumbles out of the window and plummets into the courtyard below.</p>

As you approach the ravine, you hear the sounds of fierce fighting and see intermittent flashes of magical energy piercing the gloom. The winged horde are making a determined attack upon the grounded skyship, but Lord Rimoah and his young crewmen are putting up a spirited defence.</p>
       <p>When you reach the edge of the ravine, you are confronted by the unexpected sight of <cite>Cloud-dancer</cite> rising rapidly into the darkening sky. A bloody battle is raging along her decks as the winged beasts attempt to wrest control of the skyship from the crew. You magnify your vision and catch sight of Lord Rimoah standing at the craft<ch.apos/>s stern, near to the boarding cage. For a few moments your eyes meet and you make a telepathic link. He hurls a metallic tube in your direction and you hear his voice in your mind, urging you to retrieve it. Then the link is broken when he is forced to defend himself from a determined attacker. You watch the tube strike a rock at the edge of the ravine, and then it disappears from sight. With fear running cold in your veins, you watch helplessly as the beleaguered skyship powers away towards the east, pursued by the flying swarm of ravening beasts.</p>

       <p>Lord Rimoah and Lord Ghadra are among the many on deck who are anxiously watching and praying for you to appear, though no one is expecting your arrival will be by air. The crew can hardly believe their eyes when you bring the sky-chariot down to land upon the deck. Within seconds of touching down, you are surrounded by a mass of cheering countrymen.</p>
       <p>Lord Rimoah appears among the excited throng. With tears of joy in his eyes, he embraces you and then offers up a prayer of thanksgiving to Goddess Ishir for your safe return. You deliver to him the Claw of Naar and he vows that this accursed artefact will be destroyed by the Elder Magi to prevent it from ever falling into the hands of Autarch Sejanoz.</p>
       <p>Congratulations, Grand Master. You have met this difficult challenge and you have triumphed. Your brave and daring exploits will long be remembered in the legends of the New Order Kai.

       <p>The Autocracy of Bhanar is dominated by the Bhanarian Plain, to the south of the range of mountains known as the Southern Dammerdons. Dotted across the vast area of grassland are several areas of coniferous woodland, such as the haunted Vanchou Forest. Bisecting the plain is the River Tehda which arcs from north to southwest, entering the Forest of Dhang before emptying into the sea.</p>
       <p>South of the vast Dhang Forest is the city of Otavai on the coast. To the east of Otavai, a forested headland a few miles wide protrudes southward before the northern gulf of the Chai Sea swings in an arc northwards from west to east. In this gulf lie Jinzh Island, Fazoh Island, and the isle of Skia. Along the northernmost part of this gulf, the Bhinzhi Forest gradually gives way to hilly uplands to the east. Here lies the coastal city of Yua Klio. North of the city are the Honah Mountains, while to its east, the uplands give way to the sodden lowlands of the Voxai Swamp at the mouth of the River Heng. The River Heng has its source many miles to the north in the Hyunsei Mountains at the eastern edge of the Bhanarian Plain.</p>
       <p>East of the River Heng is the Angfeng Forest in the peaceful country of Chai. The swamps, forests, and hills form a natural border between the two countries. Deep in the Angfeng Forest are three border outposts<ch.emdash/>Fort Xian, Fort Jhung, and Fort Kinani<ch.emdash/>and beyond these the forest gives way to grassland, upon which is built the Chaian capital city<ch.emdash/>Pensei.</p>
