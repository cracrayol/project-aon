   <p>You are the warrior, Lone Wolf, last of the Kai Masters of Sommerlund and sole survivor of the massacre that destroyed your kinsmen during a bitter war with your age-old enemies<ch.emdash/>the Darklords of Helgedad.</p>
   <p>Many centuries have passed since Sun Eagle, the first of your kind, established the Order of the Kai. Aided by the magicians of Dessi, he completed a perilous quest to find seven crystals of power, known as the Lorestones of Nyxator, and upon their discovery he unlocked a wisdom and strength that lay within both the Lorestones and himself. He recorded the nature of his discoveries and his experiences in a great tome entitled <cite>The Book of the Magnakai</cite>. You have discovered this lost Kai treasure and have given a solemn pledge to restore the Kai to their former glory, thereby ensuring the security of your land in the years to come. However, your diligent study of this ancient book has enabled you to master only three of the ten Magnakai Disciplines. To fulfil your pledge, you must complete the quest first undertaken by Sun Eagle over one thousand years ago. By doing so successfully, you, too, will acquire the power and wisdom of the Magnakai, which is held within the Lorestones<ch.apos/> crystal forms.</p>
   <p>Already your quest has taken you far from your northern homeland. Following in the footsteps of the first Kai Grand Master, you journeyed to Dessi and sought the help of the Elder Magi, the magicians that aided Sun Eagle on his quest long ago. There you learned that one of the seven Lorestones was still present in their land, hidden deep inside an island stronghold known as Kazan-Oud, or Castle Death. You survived the perils of Castle Death and emerged triumphant, having achieved what the Elder Magi had believed to be impossible. During the victory celebrations held in your honour, you learned that for centuries the Elder Magi had been expecting your coming. An ancient Dessi legend tells of the birth and rise to greatness of two <foreign xml:lang="x-dessi">koura-tas-kai</foreign>, which means <quote>sons of the sun</quote>. One was named <foreign xml:lang="x-dessi">Ikar</foreign>, which means <quote>eagle</quote>, and the other was named <foreign xml:lang="x-dessi">Skarn</foreign>, which means <quote>wolf</quote>. A prophecy foretold that the <foreign xml:lang="x-dessi">koura-tas-kai</foreign> would both come from the north to seek the council of the Elder Magi in order that they might fulfil a great quest. Although separated by several centuries, they would share one spirit, one purpose, and one destiny<ch.emdash/>to triumph over the champions of darkness in an age of great peril. Your victory at Kazan-Oud proved that you were <foreign xml:lang="x-dessi">Skarn</foreign><ch.emdash/>the wolf of Dessi legend<ch.emdash/>and in keeping with their ancient vows the Elder Magi promised to help you complete the Magnakai quest.</p>
   <p>In Elzian, the capital of Dessi, you were tutored in the histories of Magnamund and received lessons in lore that you would have learned from Kai Masters if only they, like you, had survived the murderous Darklord attack on the Kai Monastery eleven years ago. You were eager to learn all that your tutor, Lord Rimoah, could teach you in preparation for the next stage of your quest, but grim news from the Darklands cut short your tuition. In the Darklord city of Helgedad a civil war had erupted, following your defeat of Haakon, Archlord of the Black City. After five years, the battle for the throne of Helgedad had finally been won by a Darklord called Gnaag. The other Darklords, now united behind this new leader, were ordered to amass huge armies in preparation for the conquest of Magnamund. So swiftly did their Giak legions grow in numbers that the Elder Magi ceased their counselling and arranged for you to begin at once the search for the third Lorestone. Guided by Lord Paido, a warrior-magician of Dessi, you set off on a perilous journey across the Freelands of Talestria on your way to the jungle-swamps of the Danarg. There, in an ancient temple that was once the Elder Magi<ch.apos/>s most sacred place of worship, you succeeded in discovering the object of your quest. However, during your escape from the Danarg, your guide, Lord Paido, was captured by Darklord agents, and upon your return to Elzian you learned the fearful news that the Darklords were now waging open war throughout Magnamund. Several lands, after brief but futile resistance, had been overrun completely by Darkland armies; others had surrendered without fighting in the face of their determined might, and sadly there were others who chose to betray former friends and allies by joining the Darklord cause, in the misguided hope that they would share in the spoils of victory, following the triumph of Darklord Gnaag. One such land was Vassagonia, a powerful desert realm to the north of Dessi. Already her armies had invaded the neighbouring territories of Casiorn and Cloeasia, and were preparing to march through the Republic of Anari in order to join Gnaag<ch.apos/>s horde now advancing across the plain of Slovia. The thought of such an eventuality filled the Elder Magi with dread, for the Lorestone you must find next lies deep below the streets of Tahou, the capital of Anari, in an ancient city built during the dawn of Magnamund. If Tahou were to fall before your arrival the chances of you completing your quest successfully would be slim indeed, even for a warrior of your renowned skill and daring.</p>
   <p>Whilst preparations were being made for your journey you learned that the Darklords had attacked and captured Ruanon, the southernmost province of your homeland of Sommerlund. The news of this calamity shook your resolve and filled you with the desire to forego the journey to Tahou and return home without delay. The Elder Magi implored you not to abandon your quest and you faced a difficult and crucial decision. Which should you honour: your vow to complete the Magnakai quest or your oath of loyalty to your King, an oath which pledged your service in the defence of the sun-realm? Fortunately, the surprise arrival of an old friend was to decide the matter for you. Magemaster Banedon, envoy of the Brotherhood of the Crystal Star<ch.emdash/>the Magicians<ch.apos/> Guild of Sommerlund<ch.emdash/>landed unexpectedly at Elzian aboard his flying ship Skyrider. He and his dwarven crew were warmly greeted, for Banedon, a frequent and favoured visitor to Dessi, was highly respected by the Elder Magi for his mastery of new magic. Six years had passed since last you met and there was much you wished to discuss and reminisce about, but there was an urgent matter of duty to perform first. Banedon had been sent by King Ulnar of Sommerlund to deliver into your hand a royal missive concerning your quest. The scroll, written and sealed by the King himself, ordered you to pursue the Magnakai quest above all other duties. It ended with the words: <quote>Sommerlund has suffered a grievous defeat at Ruanon, but the will of the people is undaunted and the strength of our army undiminished. Boldly we will resist our enemies so long as there is hope of the rebirth of the Kai.</quote></p>
   <p>Banedon informed you that the King had ordered that he and his skyship be placed under your command. He also delivered the news that the King had bestowed upon you the rank of Warmarshall of the Royal Estates. Proudly you accepted from Banedon two platinum badges, each crafted in the shape of a blazing sun, and affixed them to the collar of your Kai tunic. They signified that you were now a general of the Sommlending army, the youngest general there had ever been. The honour bestowed upon you lifted your spirits, and the news that Banedon would be joining your quest helped greatly to allay your fear of the dangers that lay ahead. For two years Banedon had lived in Tahou as Journeymaster to his guild; his knowledge of the city and of the Tahou Cauldron, the entrance to the ancient metropolis, which lies buried deep beneath the city streets, would be especially useful.</p>
   <p>On the eve of your journey to Tahou, the Elder Magi convened a meeting of the High Council. A golden torch was lit and placed in the centre of their great cylindrical council chamber as a symbol of their hopes and prayers for your success.</p>
   <p><quote>This torch shall burn so long as you, Lone Wolf, pursue your destiny along the path of the Magnakai,</quote> said Lord Rimoah, speaker for the High Council. Before the gathering of Elders you reaffirmed your vow to restore the Kai and, as if kindled by a sudden gust of wind, the torch flared brightly, bathing the chamber in its vivid golden glow. As one, the Elders rose from their seats and intoned their blessing: <quote>May the Gods Ishir and Kai protect you on your journey into darkness, <foreign xml:lang="x-dessi">Kor-Skarn</foreign>.</quote></p>

   <data>
    <p>You keep a record of your adventure on the <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
    <p>During your training as a Kai Master you have developed fighting prowess<ch.emdash/><typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ><ch.emdash/>and physical stamina<ch.emdash/><typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ>. Before you set off on your adventure you need to measure how effective your training has been. To do this take a pencil and, with your eyes closed, point with the blunt end of it onto the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a>. If you pick 0 it counts as zero.</p>
    <p>The first number that you pick from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> in this way represents your <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ>. Add 10 to the number you picked and write the total in the <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> section of your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a> (i.e. if your pencil fell on the number 4 in the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> you would write in a <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> of 14). When you fight, your <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> will be pitted against that of your enemy. A high score in this section is therefore very desirable.</p>
    <p>The second number that you pick from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> represents your powers of <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ>. Add 20 to this number and write the total in the <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> section of your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a> (i.e. if your pencil fell on the number 6 on the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> you would have 26 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points).</p>
    <p>If you are wounded in combat you will lose <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points. If at any time your <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points fall to zero or below, you are dead and the adventure is over. Lost <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points can be regained during the course of the adventure, but your number of <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points can never rise above the number you started with.</p>
    <p><strong>If you have successfully completed any of the previous adventures in the <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> series</strong>, you can carry your current scores of <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> and <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points over to Book 9. You may also carry over any Weapons and Special Items you have in your possession at the end of your last adventure, and these should be entered on your new <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>. (You are still limited to two Weapons and eight Backpack Items.)</p>
    <p>You many choose one bonus <a idref="discplnz">Magnakai Discipline</a> to add to your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a> for every <cite>Lone Wolf Magnakai</cite> adventure you successfully complete (Books 6<ch.endash/>12).</p>

      <p>During your training as a Kai Lord, and in the course of the adventures that led to the discovery of <cite>The Book of the Magnakai</cite>, you have mastered all ten of the basic warrior skills known as the Kai Disciplines.</p>
      <p>After studying <cite>The Book of the Magnakai</cite>, you have also reached the rank of Kai Master Superior, which means that you have learnt <em>three</em> of the Magnakai Disciplines listed below. It is up to you to choose which three skills these are. As all of the Magnakai Disciplines may be of use to you at some point on your adventure, pick your three with care. The correct use of a Magnakai Discipline at the right time can save your life.</p>
      <p>The Magnakai skills are divided into groups, each of which is governed by a separate school of training. These groups are called <quote>Lore-circles</quote>. By mastering all of the Magnakai Disciplines in a particular Lore-circle, you can gain an increase in your <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> and <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points score. (See the section <quote><a idref="lorecrcl">Lore-circles of the Magnakai</a></quote> for details of these bonuses.)</p>
      <p>When you have chosen your three Magnakai Disciplines, enter them in the Magnakai Disciplines section of your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>.</p>

        <p>This Magnakai Discipline enables a Kai Master to become proficient in the use of all types of weapon. When you enter combat with a weapon you have mastered, you add 3 points to your <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ>. If you have the Magnakai Discipline of Weaponmastery with Bow, you may add 3 to any number that you choose from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a>, when using the Bow. The rank of Kai Master Superior, with which you begin the Magnakai series, means you are skilled in <em>three</em> of the weapons in the list below.</p>

        <p>The fact that you are skilled with three weapons does not mean that you begin the adventure carrying any of them.

        <p>If you choose this skill, write <quote>Weaponmastery: <ch.plus/>3 <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> points</quote> on your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>, and tick your chosen weapons on the <a idref="action">Weapons List</a>. You cannot carry more than two Weapons.</p>

        <p>It is a powerful Discipline, but it is also a costly one. For every round of combat in which you use Psi-surge, you must deduct 2 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points.

      <p>Before leaving Dessi on your journey to the city of Tahou, the Elder Magi give you a <a idref="map">map of the Republic of Anari</a> and its surrounding lands, and a pouch of gold. To find out how much gold is in the pouch, pick a number from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a>. Add 10 to the number you have picked. The total equals the number of Gold Crowns inside the pouch, and you should now enter this number in the <quote>Gold Crowns</quote> section of your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>. If you have successfully completed books 1<ch.endash/>8 of the <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> adventures, you may add this sum to the total sum of Crowns you already possess. You can carry a maximum of only fifty Crowns, but additional Crowns can be left in safekeeping at your Kai Monastery.</p>
      <p>The Elder Magi offer you a choice of equipment to aid you on your perilous mission. You can take five items from the list below, again adding to these, if necessary, any you may already possess. However, remember that you can carry a maximum of two Weapons and eight Backpack Items.</p>

      <p>There will be occasions during your adventure when you have to fight an enemy. The enemy<ch.apos/>s <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> and <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points are given in the text. Lone Wolf<ch.apos/>s aim in the combat is to kill the enemy by reducing his <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points to zero while losing as few <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points as possible himself.</p>
      <p>At the start of a combat, enter Lone Wolf<ch.apos/>s and the enemy<ch.apos/>s <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points in the appropriate boxes on the Combat Record section of your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
      <p>The sequence for combat is as follows:</p>
      <ol class="paragraphed">
       <li><p>Add any extra points gained through your Magnakai Disciplines and Special Items to your current <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> total.</p></li>
       <li>
        <p>Subtract the <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> of your enemy from this total. The result is your Combat Ratio. Enter it on the <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
        <p>Example</p>
        <p>Lone Wolf (<typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> 15) is attacked by a Nightstalker (<typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> 22). He is not given the opportunity to evade combat but must stand and fight as the creature leaps on him. Lone Wolf has the Magnakai Discipline of Psi-surge to which the Nightstalker is not immune, so Lone Wolf adds 4 points to his <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ>, giving a total <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> of 19.</p>
        <p>He subtracts the Nightstalker<ch.apos/>s <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> from his own, giving a Combat Ratio of <ch.minus/>3. (19 <ch.minus/> 22 = <ch.minus/>3). <ch.minus/>3 is noted on the <a idref="action">Action Chart</a> as the Combat Ratio.</p>
       </li>
       <li><p><a id="stage3">When you have your Combat Ratio</a>, pick a number from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a>.</p></li>
       <li>
        <p>Turn to the <a idref="crtable">Combat Results Table</a>. Along the top of the chart are shown the Combat Ratio numbers. Find the number that is the same as your Combat Ratio and cross-reference it with the random number that you have picked (the random numbers appear on the side of the chart). You now have the number of <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points lost by both Lone Wolf and his enemy in this round of combat. (E represents points lost by the enemy; LW represents points lost by Lone Wolf.)</p>
        <p>Example</p>
        <p>The Combat Ratio between Lone Wolf and the Nightstalker has been established as <ch.minus/>3. If the number taken from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> is a 6, then the result of the first round of combat is:</p>
        <ul>
         <li>Lone Wolf loses 3 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points (plus an additional 2 points for using Psi-surge)</li>
         <li>Nightstalker loses 6 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points</li>
        </ul>
       </li>
       <li><p>On the <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>, mark the changes in <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points to the participants in the combat.</p></li>
       <li><p>Unless otherwise instructed, or unless you have an option to evade, the next round of combat now starts.</p></li>
       <li><p>Repeat the sequence from <a idref="stage3">Stage 3</a>.</p></li>
      </ol>
      <p>This process of combat continues until the <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points of either the enemy or Lone Wolf are reduced to zero or below, at which point that combatant is declared dead. If Lone Wolf is dead, the adventure is over. If the enemy is dead, Lone Wolf proceeds but with his <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points possibly reduced.</p>

      <p>In the years before their massacre, the Kai Masters of Sommerlund devoted themselves to the study of the Magnakai. These skills were divided into four schools of training called <quote>Lore-circles</quote>. By mastering all of the Magnakai Disciplines of a Lore-circle, the Kai Masters developed their fighting prowess (<typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ>), and their physical and mental stamina (<typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ>) to a level far higher than any mortal warrior could otherwise attain.</p>
      <p>Listed below are the four Lore-circles of the Magnakai and the skills that must be mastered in order to complete them.</p>
      <dl>
      <dt>Circle of Fire</dt>
       <dd>Weaponmastery <ch.ampersand/> Huntmastery</dd>

      <p>As you rise through the higher levels of Magnakai training you will find that some of your skills will steadily improve. If you have reached the rank of Primate (four skills), Tutelary (five skills), or Principalin (six skills), you will now benefit from improvements to the following Magnakai Disciplines:</p>

         <dt>Animal Control</dt>
          <dd>Primates with this Magnakai Discipline are able to repel an animal that is intent on harming them by blocking its sense of taste and smell. The level of success is dependent on the size and ferocity of the animal.</dd>
         <dt>Curing</dt>
          <dd>Primates with this skill have the ability to delay the effects of poisons, including venoms, that they may come into contact with. Although a Kai Primate with this skill is not able to neutralize a poison he is able to slow its effect, giving him more time to find an antidote or cure.</dd>
         <dt>Huntmastery</dt>
          <dd>Primates with this skill have a greatly increased agility and are able to climb without the use of climbing aids, such as ropes, etc.</dd>
         <dt>Psi-surge</dt>
          <dd>Primates with the Magnakai Discipline of Psi-surge will, by concentrating their psychic powers upon an object, be able to set up vibrations that may lead to the disruption or destruction of the object.</dd>
         <dt>Nexus</dt>

         <dt>Invisibility</dt>
          <dd>Tutelaries are able to increase the effectiveness of their skill when hiding from an enemy by drawing the enemy<ch.apos/>s attention to a place other than that in which they are hiding. The effectiveness of this ability increases as a Kai Master rises in rank.</dd>
         <dt>Pathsmanship</dt>
          <dd>Tutelaries with this skill can detect an enemy ambush within 500 yards of their position unless their <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> score is low due to wounds sustained or lack of food.</dd>
         <dt>Psi-screen</dt>
          <dd>Tutelaries with this skill develop mental defences against magical charms and hostile telepathy. These defences increase in strength as a Kai Master rises in rank.</dd>
         <dt>Divination</dt>
          <dd>Tutelaries who possess this Magnakai Discipline are able to recognize objects or creatures with magical skills or abilities. However, this improved Discipline can be negated if the creature or object is shielded from detection.</dd>

          <dd>Principalins using this skill in combat are able to confuse an enemy by planting seeds of doubt in its mind. The effectiveness of this ability increases as a Kai Master rises in rank.</dd>
         <dt>Nexus</dt>

    <p>Your search for the Lorestone of Tahou will be fraught with danger. The Darklords have launched a massive invasion into the freelands of Magnamund in a bid to take over the continent and thwart your Magnakai quest. Make notes as you progress through the story<ch.emdash/>they will be of great help in this and future adventures.</p>
    <p>Many things that you find will help you during your adventure. Some Special Items will be of use in future <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> adventures and others may be red herrings of no real use at all, so be selective in what you decide to keep.</p>
    <p>Choose your three Magnakai Disciplines with care, for a wise choice enables any player to complete the quest, no matter how weak his initial <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> and <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points scores. Successful completion of previous <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> adventures, although an advantage, is not essential for the completion of this Magnakai adventure.</p>
    <p>The future of Northern Magnamund now hinges on the success of this quest. May the spirit of your ancestors guide you on the path of the Magnakai.</p>
    <p>Good luck!</p>

      <p>A full moon lights the sky above Elzian on the evening you begin your journey to Tahou. Its ashen rays glimmer along the polished wooden outriggers that run the length of the hull of the <cite>Skyrider</cite>, and illuminate the crystal star ensign and the Sommlending flag as it flutters proudly from the mizzen-mast. The Elders of the High Council have gathered on the roof of their council chamber and, as you and Banedon climb the boarding ladder to the skyship, you pause to return their farewell salute. Bo<ch.apos/>sun Nolrim, senior member of Banedon<ch.apos/>s crew of dwarves, welcomes you and his captain aboard. Surveying the craft, you notice that the <cite>Skyrider</cite> has changed very little since you were last aboard her, when you sailed the desert skies of Vassagonia in search of <cite>The Book of the Magnakai</cite>. The crew remember that voyage fondly and are justly proud of the part they played in the success of that perilous mission. <quote>Take the helm, bo<ch.apos/>sun, and set a course for Navasari!</quote> commands Banedon, as he leads you across the busy deck to his cabin at the prow.</p>
      <p>Swiftly the lights of Elzian vanish as the <cite>Skyrider</cite> speeds into the night. A mile below, the jungle of Dessi and the barren peaks of the Xulun Mountains race past beneath the keel, but in the comforting warmth of Banedon<ch.apos/>s cabin you feel no sensation of movement; only the hum of the powerful engine indicates how rapidly you are travelling. Over a delicious meal of salt beef and spiced fruit, Banedon explains the purpose of your journey to Navasari, a city that lies over a hundred miles south of Tahou. <quote>Our enemies are advancing across Magnamund like a tidal wave, destroying or carrying with them all in their path,</quote> says the blond-haired magician, pointing to a map of the continent that adorns the cabin wall. <quote>Every day a new battle is being fought, and every day we lose another town or village to the Darklords. Before we venture into Tahou we must be sure that the city has not already fallen to Darklord Gnaag, lest we fly straight into a trap. I have many friends in Navasari, reliable friends, friends who are highly placed in the Senate of Anari. From them we will learn if the city still stands, and if it does, how long we can expect it to resist a Darklord assault.</quote></p>
      <p>Mid-morning of the following day, the lookout catches a glimpse of Navasari as the <cite>Skyrider</cite> emerges from the Yajo Pass. Banedon takes control of the helm and steers the craft towards the east quarter of the city, landing it on the spacious roof of a magnificent, star-shaped building that overlooks the River Chah. A group of dignitaries, resplendent in high-necked robes of green and yellow silk, greet your arrival: these are some of the friends of whom Banedon spoke. Sadly they recount the grim course of events that has recently befallen their country. In the far north, the town of Resa was destroyed and its people massacred by an army of Giaks. Two days later, a similar attack was launched by a Vassagonian army against the town of Zila. They swept along the Anari Pass, burning and looting every village through which they rode, and giving no quarter to those who dared resist them. And three days ago, on the western border, a fierce battle was fought at the Slovian town of Lovka for control of the bridge across the River Churdas. Shortly before midnight the might of Darklord Gnaag<ch.apos/>s horde fell upon the beleaguered garrison. They fought bravely, but by the dawn of the following day, all that remained of the town and its defenders were an acre of scorched earth and a cart full of charred bones. The three enemy armies are now advancing towards Tahou. President Toltuda, the head of state, has ordered the evacuation of all women and children from the capital, and has begun strengthening the city<ch.apos/>s defences to increase its chances of withstanding the impending siege. When Banedon tells of your intention to go to Tahou, one of his friends offers a few words of caution. <quote>It would be unwise to attempt a landing at the capital,</quote> he warns. <quote>Heavy bolt throwers have been positioned on every rooftop and tower in case the city is attacked from the air. The Darklords captured Suentina in such a fashion and the Tahouese have learnt from their neighbour<ch.apos/>s misfortune. Skyships rarely visit Tahou, which makes it all the more likely that your craft would be mistaken for a hostile attacker.</quote></p>
      <p>After long deliberation, you and Banedon decide to leave the <cite>Skyrider</cite> in Navasari and journey to Tahou by horse. Nolrim is left in charge of the craft and crew with instructions to wait here for your return. If Tahou is besieged and he has not received word from you after two weeks, he is to return to Dessi and report that your quest has failed.</p>

      <p>Early next morning, you and Banedon climb into the saddles of two white Anarian steeds provided by his friends, and set off on your two-day ride to Tahou. Less than an hour after leaving Navasari you see a long line of wagons approaching. They are escorted by a troop of cavalry, and each one is crowded with women and children.</p>

      <p>You look upon the city of Tahou from the balcony of a tall tower, the spire of the Thalis Temple, situated at the heart of the Rainbow Park. It is noon, but there is no brightness in this day, for a grey blanket of smoke covers the sky. Below you lies a shattered city, its once proud buildings now seething infernos, its streets and squares choked with rubble. Hasty defences have been constructed where the city wall is holed or fallen, and the battlements to the north and east are covered with unburied dead.</p>

      <p>Beyond the wall, the flats lie shrouded in a mist that curls like the smoke of a thousand campfires. Its thickness is unnatural and you sense at once that it has been conjured to hide the enemy. You leave the tower and make your own way through the burning streets towards the West District, where the fighting at the wall is fiercest. You pass the smouldering ruins of the Anarium and take a fire-swept street that leads to the West Gate. A building at the end of this street is being used as a shelter for the wounded. The roof has caught fire and a handful of soldiers are trying desperately to evacuate the wounded before it collapses.</p>

      <p>The metal begins to get hot and soon you can bend it with your fingers. Suddenly it bursts into flames, forcing you to fling it aside before it burns your hand. The flaming token hits the lake and explodes in a cloud of white, powdery smoke. The echo of the explosion reverberates across the water, and you turn to leave straight away in case it attracts more ghoulish inhabitants.</p>

      <p>The track takes you to the outskirts of a small river village. It looks deserted but as though the inhabitants have left in a hurry, taking nothing with them. A window shutter slams repeatedly in the distance, and you feel the chill of premonition as you ride along the empty cobbled street. As you approach the river wharf you suddenly hear new sounds, sounds that make you stop your horse dead in its tracks. You can hear the harsh voices of Giak soldiers.</p>

      <p>Your caution is well placed. As soon as the door creaks open, a bolt of fiery energy screams over your head and explodes with a tremendous ear-splitting crack against the stairs behind. It was launched from a tube of glowing crystal, supported on the shoulders of two reptilians, kneeling in the corridor ahead. Their long jaws fall open in shocked surprise when they see you rise to your feet and run towards them, your weapon drawn ready to strike.</p>

      <p>Slowly the ghouls slink away until their forms merge with the shadows at the far side of the lake. One of their number has been crouching above the entrance to the hollow, waiting to drop on you at the first opportunity, but, on seeing its kin disperse, it decides not to remain any longer. As it jumps down from the step above, an odd-looking token falls from the pocket of its tattered jacket. It tries to retrieve it but you step forward and strike a blow that lays open its stringy grey hand, and the accursed creature scurries away hissing ghoulish obscenities.</p>

      <p>It is a grand building of polished red stone set with small, diamond-paned windows. You pass beneath its arched gateway and climb the tiled steps that lead to the front door. Twice you rap the twisted iron knocker and wait expectantly for the portal to creak slowly open. Minutes later, it swings back to reveal two men standing in the doorway. One is the grey-haired, aristocratic figure of Chiban; the other, to your utter astonishment, is your companion Banedon.</p>

      <p><quote>I heard of my former pupil<ch.apos/>s arrest and made arrangements for his release.

I have knowledge of that which you seek and I shall aid you all I can so that you may recover it.</quote></p>
      <p>The master magician beckons you both to follow him to his study. The room is filled with massive wooden racks of books and papers, and at its centre a large circular table stands completely covered with the implements of his magical researches. He clears a space amid this clutter and motions you to sit. <quote>You must both be famished after your journey and your ordeal. Come, eat and enjoy.</quote></p>

      <p><quote>The Elder Magi sent word of your coming, Lone Wolf,</quote> says Gwynian. <quote>They knew of my appointment to the city judiciary when I came to live here two years ago. My home, the Halls of Learning in Varetta, was destroyed by a fire set by agents of the Darklords. Like yourself, I am a sole survivor, the last of my order. The Elders asked me to afford you what protection I could and to help you in your quest for the Lorestone of Tahou.</quote></p>
      <p>He leads you to a table, the surface of which is engraved with a huge map of the city. With a rod of glass he points to the location of the Tahou Cauldron: it is in the Square of the Dragons in the West District of the city. <quote>The Cauldron is a funnel-shaped hollow with a circular shaft at its base. The shaft descends to the ruins of the ancient city of Zaaryx, 500 feet below Tahou. Legend tells us that the Lorestone was thrown into the Cauldron to prevent the Black Zakhan of Vassagonia from capturing it during the Great Khordaim War. The shaft was closed off and has remained sealed for the last 360 years.</quote></p>
      <p>You ask Gwynian if he can order the release of your companion. <quote>It has already been done,</quote> he replies. <quote>I released Banedon into the custody of his former mentor, Chiban the Magician, three hours ago. He is with him now at his house on Leech Street. He is quite safe, but you must not delay your quest any further by going there yourself. At dawn the enemy will be at the gates of the city, and the battle for Tahou will have begun. There is only one man that can help now, for there is only one person that can grant you access to the shaft of the Cauldron that descends to Zaaryx. That man is President Toltuda of Anari. Come, I will arrange an audience with him immediately.</quote></p>

You glance upwards to see the faces of a dozen soldiers, peering down at you from behind a parapet that encircles the high enclosure walls.

      <p>Silently you slip from the saddle and peer around the corner. In the middle of the street beyond, a company of Giak scouts are sifting through items they have looted from the village. Two of the evil creatures are loading their booty onto the back of a Kraan, a large, black-winged creature, while the others cram their ill-gotten gains in their pockets and packs. What they cannot carry they delight in despoiling, leaving behind a trail of filth and debris in the buildings they have ransacked.</p>
      <p><foreign xml:lang="x-giak"><quote>Oka der!</quote></foreign> shouts their officer, brandishing a long, black sword with a jagged edge. <foreign xml:lang="x-giak"><quote>Akamaza ek!</quote></foreign> His greedy soldiers are reluctant to obey his commands, but a few blows with the flat of his blade quickly change their minds. Muttering and snarling, they scurry off into a side alley, reappearing a few minutes later astride large, grey wolves. <foreign xml:lang="x-giak"><quote>Rekenara kluz!</quote></foreign> growls the officer, and the pack ride out of the village, heading north along the bank of the River Churdas.</p>

      <p>The Kraan and its two riders take to the air, but the beast is so overburdened with loot that it cannot clear the rooftops. Frantically it beats its leathery wings, hovering erratically just a few feet off the ground. The Giaks urge it on with kicks and punches, but to no avail. Suddenly it lurches forward and the Giaks tumble head-first onto the cobblestones a few feet from where you stand. <foreign xml:lang="x-giak"><quote>Orgadaka!</quote></foreign> they cry, as they catch sight of you and Banedon hiding at the corner.</p>

      <p>Fearfully you approach the shadow until you can discern its gruesome features. It is a ghoul, similar to those you encountered in the hollow, but this creature looks even less human. Its swollen skull is set lopsided on its withered frame, and the long black tongue that hangs from its jagged mouth drips with a sticky black venom that bubbles like boiling acid as it hits the ground. It raises a wasted hand and a cone of mist whirls towards your chest.</p>

      <p>A rough dirt track leads away from the hut and into the hills above. It is a precarious path to follow, especially on horseback and at dusk. Only your quick wits and Kai skills keep you and your horse from plunging into the steep-sided gullies that border the rocky track.</p>
      <p>Eventually you arrive at a junction, where the path meets a wider road heading north and south. A signpost lies shattered on the ground, but instinctively you know that the north route leads to Tahou. You point the way and Banedon acknowledges your signal with a wave. As you turn onto the highway you suddenly feel that you are being watched. Pinpoints of red fire glint in the darkness and the sound of hungry, panting Doomwolves comes to you on the night air. Before you can shout a warning, a shrill scream splits the night<ch.emdash/>it is the chilling sound of a Giak battle-cry. You are being attacked.</p>

Upon your arrival at the Square of the Dragons he supervises the assembly of these vital components, while you stand with Senator Zilaris and stare in awe at the Cauldron itself.</p>

      <p>In the glow of a hundred lanterns it takes on the appearance of a huge, steep-sided sink that is stoppered with a plug of stone. The key to this plug is a rod of Korlinium that, until this evening, was kept locked in the vaults of the Anarium. Now it rests in the hands of the President. Senator Chil signals that his work is complete and the President inserts the crystal rod into the plug of ancient stone. At first nothing happens. Then you sense a vibration beneath your feet. Crackling tongues of pale blue fire lap the rim of the plug and the hiss of escaping air breaks the seal of three centuries<ch.apos/> grime that holds the plug in place. Levers and ropes are brought into action and slowly the great block is lifted and the shaft to Zaaryx uncovered.</p>

      <p>He and his mentor Chiban have been viewing the siege from this vantage point for the last three days. From this position they control the movement of the few reserves allocated to the north and west city walls, using them to fill in the gaps where the enemy<ch.apos/>s attacks have weakened the defences. Banedon recounts how the siege has progressed; how twice the enemy has broken into the city and been repelled by the determined defenders. Attacks from the air have set the city ablaze, but the enemy has lost great numbers of their flying Kraan, and now they are too weak to dare use the few that remain. The Anarium was destroyed in the first few hours of the siege and many senators lost their lives, including Senator Chil and President Toltuda.</p>

He can hear the guards scratching at the wall behind, trying to locate the brick which opens the concealed entrance. Your fingers find the lever and you pull it. The panel slides aside and you both step out into an empty horse stall. As the panel slides back into position, you jam it with a piece of timber.

      <p>The courthouse of the Chief Magistrate is a grim, grey building. Devoid of any decoration or embellishment, its stark bare walls serve to remind the Tahouese of its sober purpose. It is a place where justice is meted out to wrongdoers. Harsh punishments are imposed: floggings and executions take place here every day of the week. All trials are conducted before a magistrate, and his decision is final as there are no juries in Tahou. The Chief Magistrate presides over crimes that are serious enough to warrant the death penalty, and your heart sinks when you learn that he is to sit in judgement of you.</p>
      <p>You put up quite a struggle, but your shackles prevent you from breaking free of your armed escort. They drag you into the courtroom and throw you face down into an iron cage that stands before the Chief Magistrate<ch.apos/>s chair.

      <p>The afternoon passes swiftly as you ride across endless miles of treeless grassland. You stumble upon no village or hamlet and spend the hours listening to Banedon<ch.apos/>s account of recent events in Sommerlund and the Lastlands. Three years have passed since you were last in the land of your birth, and you are hungry to hear all that has transpired since then.</p>
      <p>It is an hour past sunset and night is drawing its black cloak around you when you see a flickering red light on the road ahead: it is the village of Chadi. A great fire roars in the hearth of Guyuk<ch.apos/>s Tavern in Chadi, inviting the travel-sore to stop and warm their weary bones. You decide to stay overnight and, as soon as you have stabled your horses, you enter the tavern to ask the price of a room. The taproom is surprisingly quiet. It is full of villagers and farmers but they are a sullen crowd, content to sit in silence and brood over their glasses of lovka, a strong Slovian rye spirit named after the town where it was first distilled.</p>
      <p>Guyuk, the tavern owner, greets you with a nervous nod of his shiny bald head and shows you to a table. There are no bars or counters in Anarian taverns; instead, the customers sit at long banqueting tables and wait for the owner and his staff to serve them. He smiles uneasily as he answers your enquiry about a room. <quote>A single room with a bed would be twelve Lune each.</quote></p>

      <p>Soon you arrive at a part of the city that Banedon remembers well. It borders a large public garden called the Rainbow Park, so named because of the vast number of rare and colourful flowers that grow there. The park is now an encampment for those who have answered the President<ch.apos/>s desperate call for defenders. Survivors from the towns of Resa and Zila have joined forces with green-clad Daroga woodsmen, tough hill-dwellers from the Chah mountain valley, and river-folk from the Churdas, forming regiments to reinforce the Tahou garrison. Their battle-stained banners, lit by the flickering glow of a hundred campfires, flutter above the tents that fill the great park.</p>
      <p>Opposite the entrance stands the Guildhall of Tailors. You turn into an avenue running beside this imposing hall, and then cross into the North District by means of alleys and side streets, and finally emerge at Leech Street, just opposite the house of Chiban the Magician. His is a grand building of polished red stone set with small, diamond-paned windows that twinkle like cat<ch.apos/>s eyes in the moonlight. You pass beneath its arched gateway and climb the magnificent tiled steps that lead to a black oak door. Banedon raps the knocker and you wait patiently for it to open.</p>
      <p>Minutes later the great door swings aside and the aristocratic figure of Chiban stands framed in the doorway. Keen-eyed and grey-haired, he welcomes you both with surprise and delight.</p>
      <p><quote>Banedon!</quote> he exclaims, like a father reunited with a long lost son. <quote>How good it is to see you. But what brings you to Tahou at this darkest of hours? Have you come to offer your skills in the defence of our beleaguered city?</quote></p>
      <p><quote>My services are yours to command, my lord Chiban,</quote> answers Banedon, bowing respectfully to his former mentor. <quote>Yet also I return to your esteemed household to seek your help at the behest of King Ulnar of Sommerlund. May I introduce my companion<ch.emdash/>Lone Wolf.</quote></p>
      <p>Chiban turns his kindly gaze on you and smiles knowingly. <quote>I am honoured to meet you, Kai Lord,</quote> he says. <quote>I have knowledge of that which you seek and I shall aid you all I can in your search for it.</quote></p>
      <p>He beckons you to enter and the door closes behind you, seemingly of its own accord. You follow Chiban to his study. The musty room is lined with massive wooden racks full of books and papers. At its centre a large, circular table is completely covered with the implements of his magical researches. He clears a space amid the clutter and motions you to sit. <quote>You must both be famished after your journey here. Come, eat and enjoy!</quote> For a few seconds, a shimmering pool of light fills the space, and then fades, leaving a sumptuous meal of grilled trout, baked potatoes, hakeroot, and sparkling Anarian wine.</p>
      <p>If you have lost any <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points on your adventure so far, you may now restore 3 points as you consume this delicious meal.</p>

      <p>Before you can reply, the door bursts open and in rush six heavily armed Senate House guards.

      <p>As you draw closer you can make out the gruesome features of the shadow. It is a ghoul, similar to those you encountered at the lake, but this creature looks even less human. Its swollen skull is set lopsided on its withered frame and its tongue drips with a sticky black venom. It raises a wasted hand and launches a whirl of mist towards your chest, but your psychic defence disperses this evil swirling cloud. The creature howls with frustration. Maniacally it hurls itself at your throat, a pitted iron spike clenched in its fist.</p>

From the slopes of a wooded hill you stare down at a tiny village called Varta, perched on the edge of the Tahou flats.</p>
      <p>The flats comprise fields of cultivated crops that form a fertile market garden two miles wide. They are farmed right up to the banks of the great moat that encircles the capital. Varta is deserted: its male inhabitants now shelter within the city walls, whilst the women and children have since travelled south to the safety of Navasari. As you ride through the empty village and descend onto the flats, you catch your first awe-inspiring view of the ancient city itself.</p>

      <p>The streets and buildings of an ancient civilization lie before you, disappearing into the gloom of a titanic chasm of immeasurable size. Ziggurats and towers, their carved walls cracked and crumbling, lean at impossible angles, having sunk into the soil over the centuries. This is Zaaryx, the legendary metropolis that was once home to a race fathered by Nyxator<ch.emdash/>the greatest of all dragons. It is the only city to have survived the Age of Chaos that followed the demise of their race.</p>
      <p>A wide avenue leads from the archway to enter the city at a place flanked by two massive statues of dragons sitting on their haunches with their stone-fanged mouths agape. You stop to rest here and you must now eat a Meal or lose 3 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points. (If you possess the Magnakai Discipline of Huntmastery, you are able to forage for food from the wasteland of Zaaryx and therefore you do not need to make any deductions.)</p>

Contraband, stolen goods, and illegal cargoes impounded at the South Gate are stored here before being either destroyed or sold at auction.

On this side of the city the mist is less dense and you can see regiments of Drakkarim warriors advancing in lines towards the great moat.

Cavalry wait in reserve while siege towers and catapults are hauled forward by lumbering ghorkas and muscular leathery zull.</p>

He has a long, pointed nose and a stubbly grey beard which grows to just below his beady bloodshot eyes. The crone kneels and whispers in his ear before bowing and leaving the hut. As the door swings shut the shaman scoops up a handful of bones, closes his eyes, and, with a sound like a flock of startled gulls, casts them in the air. After a full minute of chanting and waving his hands, the old man opens his eyes and looks down on the bones which lie scattered on the beaten earth floor.</p>

      <p>At the end of the corridor a flight of steps leads down to an open prison door. Cautiously you peer around the doorway into the chamber beyond, where you see a man chained to the wall. He is lean and sinewy, with jet-black hair and a moustache, which he has braided into his long sideburns in a style known as <quote>Pirazin plaits</quote>, fashionable among Slovian men. He appears to be either asleep or unconscious.</p>
      <p>You enter the chamber, moving swiftly and silently towards a staircase on the opposite side, and immediately he springs to life. <quote>Hold fast, Northlander,</quote> he hisses. <quote>They<ch.apos/>ll catch y<ch.apos/> for sure if you take the stairs. Let me loose and I<ch.apos/>ll show you a way to slip out o<ch.apos/> here quicker than mist through a net.</quote></p>
      <p>Quickly you consider his offer, but choose to leave him, deciding instead to trust your Kai instincts to aid your escape. You shake your head and turn to leave, but the man is shrewd; he says something he knows will change your mind.</p>

Shimmering waves of silvery radiance sweep the steps and a chorus of voices, soft and sirenic, echo through the upper reaches of the chamber. You surrender yourself to instinct and step upon the dais, cupping your hands before you and raising your face to the roof. A golden light pours out of the darkness, soaking you in its brilliance and filling your senses with a glowing warmth. A gasp of awe arises from the tiers, now crowded with reptilians. They are the Crocaryx, the guardians of this city, the stewards of the Lorestone, who were placed here by the great God Kai. With joy and sorrow they have gathered to witness the fulfilment of their purpose, for your coming marks the end of their stewardship and the beginning of their demise.</p>
      <p>High above you a shadow is taking form at the core of the golden light. It is dark and leathery and shaped like an egg. Slowly it breaks and peels open to reveal a sparkling crystal sphere: it is the Lorestone of Tahou, the object of your quest.</p>

      <p>The dust cloud grows bigger and the rumble of hoofbeats can now be heard drifting towards you across the open plain. Twenty lightly armoured riders approach, their lances bearing blue pennants embroidered with the arms of Tahou, their faces stern and unsmiling beneath the peaks of their winged helmets. Their sergeant makes a signal and the horsemen change formation, drawing up into a circle that quickly closes around you. <quote>State your business here!</quote> bellows the sergeant. <quote>Why do you ride to Tahou?</quote></p>

      <p>Sogh leads you past a bubbling pool of crystal-clear water into an antechamber. Here, lying on a couch of vivid scarlet, rests the ruler of this sanctuary, dressed in an extravagant costume of many colours. His large, squarish face is framed by a hood trimmed with a strange purple fur. He stirs from his slumber and opens his coal-black eyes.</p>

      <p>The Doomwolves howl and their Giak riders cackle with glee as they hurl themselves upon you. You lash out at a grey-skinned rider, cleaving his grinning head in two, and swinging your arm back just in time to dispatch a Doomwolf that is leaping towards your face. All around you the snarl and screech and press of bodies threaten to overwhelm your senses, but you are a Kai Master and in the heat of battle your nerve is ice cool. Grimly you fight with a speed and skill that leaves a dozen dead in as many blows. But you do not fight alone. Banedon rears into view, flashes of flame spurting from his fingers with a crack, like a whip, that echoes above the din of combat. Then another wave of wolf-riders appears. They charge into the fray, driving a wedge between you and your companion. A black sword cuts the air less than an inch from your scalp, but you deal its wielder a fatal blow before he can strike a second time. He falls, yet his Doomwolf mount leaps up and clings to your horse, its claws buried in the saddle leather, its foaming jaws snapping at your throat. You must dispatch this beast quickly before it drags you both to the ground.</p>

With their women and children safe in the south, the soldiers and citizens busy themselves with preparations for the battle that is imminent. Heavy steps and the clank of weapons echo along the street as a troop of Slovian mercenaries march by, with scarlet- and black-striped shields on their arms, and polished halberds resting on their mailed shoulders. You follow as they march towards a building in the distance, where their officer orders them to halt and fall out. Most of the soldiers then enter the building, but two remain outside to talk and share a pipe of Lourden tobacco. A sign fixed to the building says:</p>

      <p>Relentlessly the enemy pour their fire upon the north and west city walls, until the black sky above Tahou takes on a vivid scarlet glow. The defenders look to their weapons uneasily and pray that the gods are with them, at least until dawn. And when the first rays of dawn light show above the eastern hills, no mists enshroud the armies of Darklord Gnaag<ch.emdash/>they are massed in all their glory, awaiting the order to attack. You cast your eye across this sea of doom and mark the many regiments of evil that are ranged against the walls of Tahou.</p>
      <p>The armoured legions of Vassagonia are the first to advance, moving in ordered columns towards the West Gate. At their head walks a figure sheathed in gold around whom a cold blue fire glows intensely. He strides within range of the city archers and they send a cloud of arrows to greet him, but these shatter and crackle when they encounter his impregnable glowing shield. He crosses the siege bridge and halts before the West Gate. In his hand is an orb of black metal. He holds it before him and mouths an incantation. Instantly a bolt of scarlet flame lances from the orb, destroying the great doors with a thunderous boom. Proudly he strides into the city and the defenders melt before him. One summons enough courage to attack him with a spear. There is a crackling flash and in an instant the soldier is transformed into a pile of glowing ash.</p>

Legend tells us that the Lorestone was thrown into the Cauldron to prevent the Black Zakhan of Vassagonia from capturing it during the Great Khordaim War. The shaft was closed off and has remained sealed for the past 360 years.</quote> He looks up from the map and you notice that his smiling features are now sad and composed.</p>

      <p>The great flagstoned precinct at the entrance to the Anarium is packed with hundreds of people. Senate officials, soldiers, and citizens crowd the steps that give access to the grand foyer and outer chambers of the hall. You notice that a side entrance is being used exclusively by army scouts who arrive with dispatches and leave with orders for the lookouts hidden in the surrounding hills. You take a calculated gamble and order the carriage driver to draw up at the side entrance. This bold move pays off; upon seeing your presidential scroll not only do the guards allow you into the Anarium, but you are escorted to the Appellant<ch.apos/>s Gallery inside the assembly hall itself.</p>

      <p>From your seat in the gallery you stare down at an oval hall, ringed by twelve arches beneath which the senators of Anari sit upon their throne-like chairs of lacquered oak. President Toltuda occupies a seat in the centre of the hall and presides over a heated discussion that is raging back and forth. Having heard all sides of the argument he calls for a vote, and the issue is decided by a show of hands.</p>
      <p><quote>We now come to a quite extraordinary matter, which has been raised by one of our most eminent citizens,</quote> says President Toltuda, introducing your appeal to the Senate. He turns to the gallery and calls out, <quote>Sommlending Lord, Lone Wolf, please make yourself known to the assembly.</quote></p>
      <p>You rise from your seat and bow to the senators. <quote>Please present your request to us, Lone Wolf,</quote> says the President, and a hush descends on the hall as you explain the purpose of your journey to Tahou. When you have finished, the President calls upon the senators to speak.</p>
      <p><quote>I say we should help the Sommlending,</quote> pipes the shrill voice of Senator Zilaris. <quote>If he finds the Lorestone, its power could turn the tide and save Tahou from the clutches of Darklord Gnaag.</quote> A murmur of agreement stirs in the hall.</p>
      <p><quote>And I say we should refuse to open the Cauldron,</quote> booms the powerful voice of Senator Chil. <quote>I say that if it were not for his presence in our city, we would be spared the attention of the Darklords. He is the object of their anger and spite. I say we should give him to them, and in doing so we will save our city, our country, our people, and ourselves!</quote> A surge of support echoes from the arches, and your skin prickles at the thought of what could happen. President Toltuda calls for a vote to decide whether the Senate should allow you to enter the Cauldron, or use you to bargain for peace with the Darklords.</p>
      <p>Tensely you await the result. The votes are cast and counted and the Senate is split evenly: six votes for you and six votes against. The decision now rests with the President himself. He must cast the deciding vote.</p>

      <p>It is a grim grey building, devoid of decoration or colour, its stark bare walls serving to remind the Tahouese of its sober purpose. It is a place where justice is meted out to wrongdoers and harsh punishments are imposed. All trials are conducted before a magistrate and his decision is final; there are no juries in Tahou. The Chief Magistrate presides over crimes that are serious enough to warrant the death penalty and, as you stare at the courthouse from the shadows of a doorway, your pulse quickens when you see his carriage draw up outside. An old man with long grey hair and a beard, he is wearing the purple and silver robes of the judiciary. He is accompanied by court guards and scribes, who help him to climb the steps to his private chambers located within the court building. When he reaches the top step he halts, turns, and points his finger at you.</p>

      <p>The father and the farmers are taking it in turns to ask each other riddles. In Anari it is forbidden to gamble for money on games of chance, but the wily Anarians get around the law by devious means. They gamble on being able to answer riddles correctly, which demands exercising skill rather than chance, and they wager goods, and sometimes their services, in place of money. By the time you join them the father and his sons have amassed quite an assortment of valuable items, and the plains farmers are clearly anxious to win back some of their lost possessions.</p>

      <p>Slowly you inch your horse forward in the inky blackness until you glimpse a flickering light off to your left. You focus on this strange emanation until you can identify the source of the light. A swarm of glowing mine flies are hovering above a puddle of milky liquid, which is bubbling from a fissure in the tunnel floor. Your horse lifts its head, sniffs the cool air, and gives voice to a harsh neigh of danger, for in the distant shadows something alien is stirring.</p>

      <p>Your companion heeds your warning and shouts a reply, but you fail to hear what he says. A tremendous noise fills your ears as the giant snake rises into the air, lifted by a pair of powerful feathered wings. Two vulture-like legs, tipped with sharp, rending claws, scrabble the air as it dives towards your chest. A bolt of crackling energy surges past your head and streaks towards the onrushing snake. But the creature is quick to avoid Banedon<ch.apos/>s attack; it banks over to the left and the bolt arcs harmlessly into the distance.

      <p>Spurred on by your triumph, the Anarian defenders rally themselves and counterattack to secure the West Gate. The Vassagonians who gained entry are either killed or forced back into the moat as the gate is quickly retaken. A cheer resounds from the city wall, a cheer that becomes a chant carrying word of Kimah<ch.apos/>s demise to the enemy beyond the moat, and gradually the advancing legions slow to a halt as their hope of an easy victory dies. Officers ride to and fro, cursing and threatening their men with all manner of punishment, but their morale is severely shaken; the ranks of armoured warriors merely stand in shocked silence and refuse to advance. The sound of distant trumpets is heard and all eyes turn to the south to see wave upon wave of mounted warriors emerging from the hills around Varta. They pour from every valley and pass to fill the southern flats with regiments of horsemen resplendent in uniforms of blue, white, and grey.</p>
      <p><quote>Our prayers have been answered,</quote> says Chiban, as he and Banedon rejoin you at the city wall. <quote>Behold, the allies of Anari have come to aid us in our darkest hour.</quote> He points to the advancing cavalry and you recognize, fluttering from their lances, the battle standards of three countries: Firalond, Lourden, and Kakush. Then the thunder of their horses<ch.apos/> hooves fills the air and a wave of joy surges through you as you witness their first charge devastate the enemy<ch.apos/>s ranks, throwing them into chaos and confusion. A great battle ensues as the enemy slowly gather themselves to resist this unexpected assault. By noon two of their armies have been smashed and routed, and the third fights a desperate rearguard action as it covers the chaotic retreat westwards.</p>
      <p>At last the fighting around the city comes to an end, and the defenders give voice to their elation that their home has been saved from the hordes of Darklord Gnaag. Senator Zilaris proclaims you <quote>the saviour of Tahou</quote>, and the victorious cheers of the citizens echo through the burning streets and across the flats that lie strewn with enemy dead. (If any of your Weapons or weapon-like Special Items were confiscated by the South Gate Guard, they are now gratefully returned to you.) You gaze at this grim panorama and your blood runs cold. But it is not the sight of the carnage that grips you with fear, it is your growing awareness of a powerful evil that is taking shape above the West Gate. A billowing black cloud forms in the sky, and from out of this cloud there comes a harsh and terrible voice.</p>
      <p><quote>I will be avenged,</quote> it booms, its resonance shaking the battlements on which you stand. You steel yourself, half expecting a bolt of lightning to leap from the cloud and hurtle towards you, but no such attack materializes. Instead, the chilling voice continues in a mocking tone. <quote>Know this: you will pay for your defiance with your life. I, Gnaag of Mozg<ch.ocirc/>ar, have the three remaining Lorestones that you seek, and I shall destroy them when I destroy you, Kai Lord.</quote></p>
      <p>A gust of wind catches the cloud and it clears swiftly, but it leaves behind a numbing dread that fills your heart, for you sense that the words were no idle threat<ch.emdash/>the terrible voice of Darklord Gnaag spoke the truth.</p>
      <p>Your quest has succeeded, for the wisdom and strength of the Lorestone of Tahou is now a part of your body and spirit, and your defeat of Zakhan Kimah has turned the tide of war decisively against the Darkland armies. But the shocking news that the Darklords now possess the remaining Lorestones of Nyxator heralds the start of a new and deadly perilous episode of the Magnakai quest.</p>
      <p>If you have the courage of a true Kai Master, the challenge of recovering the last Lorestones from the clutches of your mortal enemies awaits you, beginning in Book 10 of the <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> series, entitled:</p>

     <meta><title>Note on Standard Usage</title></meta>

     <data>
      <p>Quite a number of contributors to Project Aon have reported inconsistencies regarding the use of words such as Drakkar across the series. After much research into the usage of Drakkar/Drakkarim, Nadziran/Nadziranim, and Ligan/Liganim across the books, we have decided to standardise the usage of the words in the following ways, which represent majority usage:</p>
       <ul>
        <li>noun (s.): Drakkar</li>
        <li>noun (pl.): Drakkarim</li>
        <li>adj: Drakkarim</li>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       <li>noun (s.): Nadziran</li>
       <li>noun (pl.): Nadziranim</li>
       <li>adj: Nadziranim</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
      <li>noun (s.): Ligan</li>
      <li>noun (pl.): Liganim</li>
      <li>adj: Liganim</li>
     </ul>
     <p>All of the other words ending in -im either already conform to these rules (i.e. gazim, kuzim, lajakim, rekenarim, Sharnazim, and Tefarim) or cannot be conclusively tied to Darkland languages (e.g. Ghagrim).</p>
