     <p>In the northern land of Sommerlund, it had been the custom for many centuries to send the children of the Warrior Lords to the monastery of Kai. There they were taught the skills and disciplines of their noble fathers.</p>
     <p>You are Lone Wolf, and you are now the last of the Warrior Lords of Sommerlund. One year ago, the ancient enemy of your people<ch.emdash/>the Darklords of Helgedad<ch.emdash/>suddenly invaded Sommerlund and completely devastated the Kai Monastery. All of the Kai warriors were in attendance for the feast of Fehmarn, and all except you were massacred.</p>
     <p>You fought your way to Holmgard, the capital of your country, where the King sent you upon a desperate quest for help. Your mission was fraught with great danger, for Sommerlund had been betrayed by one of its own magicians<ch.emdash/>Vonotar the Traitor. His agents sought to kill you at every opportunity, but your skill and strength defeated their evil aims. You returned to Holmgard at the head of a great fleet<ch.emdash/>the allies of Durenor<ch.emdash/>and destroyed the Darklord army that besieged your capital.</p>
     <p>Much of Sommerlund was ruined by the war. The rich farmlands were laid waste and many towns were razed to the ground. But the Sommlending are a tough people and were undaunted by the enormous task that lay ahead. They set about the rebuilding of war-torn Sommerlund with such determination that now, one year later, few of the scars of war remain visible.</p>
     <p>For the crucial part that you played in the victory, the King has bestowed upon you the rank and title of <quote>Fryearl of Sommerlund</quote>, a rare honour for one so young. The ruins of the Kai Monastery and much of the surrounding lands are now <quote>Fryelund</quote> under your protection.</p>
     <p>Work to rebuild the monastery was about to commence when disturbing news from the north prompted the King to summon you to the capital. Many merchants, returning from the summer trading expeditions to Kalte, told of the fall of the Brumalmarc<ch.emdash/>the leader of the Ice Barbarians. The description of the hunchbacked magician who has succeeded the fierce Brumalmarc fits only one man<ch.emdash/>Vonotar the Traitor.</p>
     <p>After the defeat of the Darklords, Vonotar escaped to the frozen wastes of Kalte. He made his way to the ice fortress of Ikaya where, through deception, he tricked the cruel Brumalmarc into adopting him as his magician. It was a mistake that was to cost the barbarian leader his fortress and his life.</p>
     <p>The news that Vonotar still lives spreads like wildfire throughout Sommerlund. Thousands of Sommlending surround the capital and demand that Vonotar be made to pay for his treachery. So great is the outcry that the King is obliged to promise that the evil traitor will be brought back to Holmgard, and made to stand trial for his crimes.</p>
     <p>For you, Lone Wolf, the King<ch.apos/>s promise is the start of a quest that will pit you against a hated foe, deep within the hostile Caverns of Kalte.</p>

     <p>You keep a record of your adventure on the <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
     <p>During your training as a Kai Lord you have developed fighting prowess<ch.emdash/><typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> and physical stamina<ch.emdash/><typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ>. Before you set off on your adventure you need to measure how effective your training has been. To do this take a pencil and, with your eyes closed, point with the blunt end of it onto the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a>. If you pick 0 it counts as zero.</p>
     <p>The first number that you pick from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> in this way represents your <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ>. Add 10 to the number you picked and write the total in the <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> section of your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a> (i.e. if your pencil fell on 4 in the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> you would write in a <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> of 14). When you fight, your <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> will be pitted against that of your enemy. A high score in this section is therefore very desirable.</p>
     <p>The second number that you pick from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> represents your powers of <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ>. Add 20 to this number and write the total in the <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> section of your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a> (i.e. if your pencil fell on the number 6 on the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> you would have 26 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points).</p>
     <p>If you are wounded in combat you will lose <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points. If at any time your <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points fall to zero or below, you are dead and the adventure is over. Lost <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points can be regained during the course of the adventure, but your number of <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points can never go above the number with which you start your adventure.</p>
     <p><strong>If you have successfully completed any of the previous adventures in the <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> series</strong>, you will already have your <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ>, <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points, and Kai Disciplines which you can now carry over with you to Book 3. You may also carry over any Weapons and Special Items that you held at the end of your last adventure, and these should be entered on your new <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>. (You are still limited to two Weapons and eight Backpack Items.)</p>
     <p>You may choose one bonus <a idref="discplnz">Kai Discipline</a> to add to your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a> for every <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> adventure you have successfully completed; then read the <a idref="equipmnt">section on equipment</a> for Book 3 carefully.</p>

       <p>Over the centuries, the Kai monks have mastered the skills of the warrior. These skills are known as the Kai Disciplines, and they are taught to all Kai Lords. You have learnt only five of the skills listed below. The choice of which five skills these are, is for you to make. As all of the Disciplines may be of use to you at some point on your perilous quest, pick your five with care. The correct use of a Discipline at the right time can save your life.</p>
       <p>When you have chosen your five Disciplines, enter them in the Kai Disciplines section of your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>.</p>

       <p>There will be occasions during your adventure when you have to fight an enemy. The enemy<ch.apos/>s <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> and <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points are given in the text. Lone Wolf<ch.apos/>s aim in the combat is to kill the enemy by reducing his <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points to zero while losing as few <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points as possible himself.</p>
       <p>At the start of a combat, enter Lone Wolf<ch.apos/>s and the enemy<ch.apos/>s <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points in the appropriate boxes on the Combat Record section of your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
       <p>The sequence for combat is as follows.</p>
       <ol class="paragraphed">
        <li><p>Add any extra points gained through your Kai Disciplines to your current <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> total.</p></li>
        <li>
         <p>Subtract the <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> of your enemy from this total. The result is your Combat Ratio. Enter it on the <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
         <p>Example</p>
         <p>Lone Wolf (<typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> 15) is ambushed by a Winged Devil (<typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> 20). He is not given the opportunity to evade combat, but must stand and fight as the creature swoops down on him. Lone Wolf has the Kai Discipline of Mindblast, to which the Winged Devil is not immune, so he adds 2 points to his <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ>, giving a total <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> of 17.</p>
         <p>He subtracts the Winged Devil<ch.apos/>s <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> from his own, giving a Combat Ratio of <ch.minus/>3. (17 <ch.minus/> 20 = <ch.minus/>3). <ch.minus/>3 is noted on the <a idref="action">Action Chart</a> as the Combat Ratio.</p>
        </li>
        <li><p><a id="stage3">When you have your Combat Ratio</a>, pick a number from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a>.</p></li>
        <li>
         <p>Turn to the <a idref="crtable">Combat Results Table</a>. Along the top of the chart are shown the Combat Ratio numbers. Find the number that is the same as your Combat Ratio and cross-reference it with the random number that you have picked (the random numbers appear on the side of the chart). You now have the number of <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points lost by both Lone Wolf and his enemy in this round of combat. (E represents points lost by the enemy; LW represents points lost by Lone Wolf.)</p>
         <p>Example</p>
         <p>The Combat Ratio between Lone Wolf and Winged Devil has been established as <ch.minus/>3. If the number taken from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> is a 6, then the result of the first round of combat is:</p>
         <ul>
          <li>Lone Wolf loses 3 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points</li>
          <li>Winged Devil loses 6 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points</li>
         </ul>
        </li>
        <li><p>On the <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>, mark the changes in <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points to the participants in the combat.</p></li>
        <li><p>Unless otherwise instructed, or unless you have an option to evade, the next round of combat now starts.</p></li>
        <li><p>Repeat the sequence from <a idref="stage3">Stage 3</a>.</p></li>
       </ol>
       <p>This process of combat continues until the <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points of either the enemy or Lone Wolf are reduced to zero or below, at which point that combatant is declared dead. If Lone Wolf is dead, the adventure is over. If the enemy is dead, Lone Wolf proceeds but with his <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points possibly reduced.</p>

         <p>During your adventure you may be given the chance to evade combat.

Only Lone Wolf may lose <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points during that round, but then that is the risk of running away!

     <p>Your mission will be fraught with great danger, for Kalte is a bleak and hostile land and your foe is a master of cunning. Use the <a idref="map">map</a> to help you plot your course to the ice fortress of Ikaya. Make notes as you progress through the story, for they will be of great help in future adventures. Many things that you find will aid you during your adventure. Some Special Items will be of use in future <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> adventures and others may be red herrings of no real use at all, so be selective in what you decide to keep.</p>
     <p>There are many routes to the ice fortress of Ikaya, but only one will enable you to capture Vonotar and return to Sommerlund with the minimum of danger. A wise choice of Kai Disciplines and a great deal of courage should enable any player to complete the mission, no matter how weak his initial <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> or <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points score. Successful completion of previous <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> adventures is not essential for the success of this quest.</p>
     <p>The betrayal of your country can be avenged by bringing the traitor to justice.</p>

       <p>Even before you accepted the task of bringing Vonotar to justice, preparations were being made for your voyage to Kalte. The captain of the Sommlending warship <cite>Cardonal</cite>, having returned from a long Kaltersee patrol, was ordered to await your arrival at Anskaven. During the night, food, ice equipment, and Kanu-dog teams were taken on board. The mission was highly secret<ch.emdash/>only senior members of the crew were told the true nature of the voyage that lay ahead.</p>
       <p>The plan is to set you ashore at Halle Bluff, drop anchor, and await your return. An <ch.eacute/>lite team of trusted guides will lead you from the bluff to Ikaya. Once inside the ice fortress, you are to hunt down and capture Vonotar, and then return with your guides to the ship. Your mission must be accomplished within thirty days at most, for winter is closing in and no ship can withstand the grip of the Kalte pack-ice. If you do not return in time, the captain will be forced to set sail without you.</p>
       <p>For six days, the <cite>Cardonal</cite> sails across the stormy Kaltersee without running into a storm; but every day the temperature steadily drops until a layer of ice covers the decks. On the morning of the seventh day, the snow-capped island of Tola is sighted on the horizon. Soon after, a light wind rises from the east.</p>
       <p>At first, there appears to be little danger, but within half an hour a furious blizzard is blowing, and all sight of land quickly vanishes in the scudding drift. All day the furious gale rages. Tremendous winds slice the tops of the huge grey waves and water crashes over the decks, masts, and rigging of the ship, freezing almost immediately into solid ice. The sides of the ship become several feet thick with seawater. It is not until early evening that the weather clears, and although the wind still blows strongly, the force of the gale is spent.</p>

       <p>You are soon to discover that the gale has blown the ship nearly thirty miles off course, along the lip of the Ljuk ice shelf. You know that to return to Halle Bluff would waste a precious day, so you decide to land on the ice shelf and start your mission from there.</p>
       <p>As the last of the Kanu-dogs are carried ashore, your guides tell you of the two possible routes to Ikaya from here. The first route involves a hundred and thirty mile trek to Cloudmaker Mountain and then, following the difficult terrain of the Viad Glacier, a further hundred miles must be covered before you arrive at the ice fortress. The alternative route involves a longer journey of nearly one hundred and eighty miles into the Hrod Basin, followed by a trek of a hundred miles through Storm Giant Pass to Ikaya. Even if the weather and your luck hold good, either route will involve ten days of hard trekking before you reach your goal. You should consult the <a idref="map">map of Kalte</a> before making your decision.</p>

       <p>You can see two men in ragged clothes, huddled together beside a fire that seems to be burning inside a small metal bowl. Over the flames, the skinned carcass of a small animal is roasting on a spit. The men are old and toothless, and they have a strange glint of madness in their slanted eyes.</p>

       <p>You cannot take the Kanu-dogs with you across the mountains, and you are forced to abandon them here with the sledges.

A wind rises that piles drifts of loose snow against the broken ice, and visibility is quickly reduced to a few yards. The drifts are deceptive and often deep. On two occasions, you sink up to your chest and have to be dug out by the others.</p>
       <p>That night, the tent is erected on a table of ice-covered granite overhanging a deep ravine. You are exhausted and almost fall asleep over your evening Meal. (Remember to deduct this Meal from your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>.)</p>

       <p>With one last effort, you reach a narrow ice shelf where you can kneel and rest. But you soon discover to your dismay that it is impossible to climb any further<ch.emdash/>you are faced by sheer walls of ice that offer no handholds in their smooth surfaces. You will have to return the way you came. It is over four hours before the feeling returns to your hands. The frostbite is serious and you lose 5 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points. In addition to this, you also lose 2 points from your initial <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ>. This <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> loss is permanent and will affect you for the rest of your life.</p>
       <p>It takes a further five hours to reach the bottom in safety. Exhausted and in great pain, you steel yourself to find another exit from this icy hell-hole.</p>

       <p><quote>Vonotar, that unspeakable wretch, is responsible for my plight. Days before the Darklord invasion of Sommerlund, he betrayed your Kai masters to win power<ch.emdash/>the black power of death and darkness. However, he failed to play his part in the war plans his evil masters had laid. The Darklords do not tolerate such weakness<ch.emdash/>mercy has no place in their brutal minds. In the bitterness of defeat, they sought to destroy Vonotar for his crime of failure. Vonotar knew that I possessed the only means to effect an escape from their vengeance, for my Guildstaff has the power of teleportation. He tried to steal it and flee to the safety of Ikaya by himself, but he learnt that its power is not for all men to share; only I am blessed with its secret. He was angry and would have murdered my kinspeople had I not agreed to bring him here, so I had no choice but to do so.</quote></p>
       <p><quote>Ever since, I have been a prisoner in this cell. Vonotar has tortured my body and my mind, but I have not divulged the secret of my Guildstaff, which he now keeps in the Hall of the Brumalmarc. For if I were to tell him, my life would no longer be of any value.</quote></p>
       <p>You tell Loi-Kymar of your mission and of the events that have led to your meeting. He offers to show you a route through Ikaya to the Hall of the Brumalmarc where Vonotar now resides as ruler, and if you can retrieve his Guildstaff, he promises to teleport you to the coast in time to rendezvous with your ship.</p>
       <p>For the first time since you fell into the caverns of Kalte, you feel confident that your mission can now succeed.</p>

       <p>You have fallen over a hundred-and-fifty feet into a massive snow drift. You are shaken and winded but otherwise unharmed. It takes nearly half an hour to tunnel your way clear and when you finally stagger out of the powdery snow, you are astounded by the sight that greets you. A huge underground cavern spreads into the distance. Stalactites of crystal hang from the icy ceiling and the constant dripping of melting snow fills this ice world with an eerie, musical sound. You are looking at an uncharted world that few Sommlending have ever seen, for you have fallen into the caverns of Kalte. This chamber is a tiny part of a massive underground labyrinth built by the Ancients, many ages before the Sommlending or even the Darklords set foot in Magnamund. Its wide avenues, temples, and halls once echoed with the sound of a race of creatures for whom the ice was a natural home. M<ch.apos/>lare bowls still hang from the roof, bathing the chamber with their eternal light.</p>
       <p>You shout towards the opening high above, but there is no reply. Irian and Fenor have given you up for dead, and they are now trying to make their way back to the <cite>Cardonal</cite>.</p>

       <p>The barb of the Kalkoth<ch.apos/>s tongue holds a powerful venom with which it paralyses its victims before eating them. It takes less than five seconds to affect you and you are unconscious before your head hits the snow.</p>
       <p>When you awake, you feel something heavy pressing down on your chest. It is the corpse of Irian. As you struggle to your feet, a bleak sight greets you through the early morning mist. Your guides are all dead and the remains of your equipment is scattered across the ledge. The bodies of two Kalkoth lie in the bloodstained snow; both have died from sword wounds. Numbed by cold and shock, you stagger about for nearly an hour searching for your Backpack, before you realize you are still wearing it.</p>
       <p>Although still shocked you eventually discover a steep path that leads away from the ledge. The winds of these hostile mountains are bitterly cold. If you have not applied Baknar oil to your skin, you lose 3 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points.</p>

       <p>Your transport to Ikaya consists of two sledges, each drawn by a team of six Kanu-dogs. This sturdy breed is native to Kalte, and they make ideal sledge dogs. Their thick tawny coats and powerful chests, as well as their vigour and enthusiasm even in the coldest climates, make them well suited to the work ahead.</p>
       <p>On board each sledge is enough food and equipment for the mission. Your three guides, Irian, Fenor, and Dyce, are all experienced trappers. They are skilled at survival in the icy desert, and know of the many unseen dangers.</p>
       <p>Once the dogs are harnessed, you and Dyce climb aboard your sledge and signal to the others to lead the way. As you stare across the frozen expanse of the Ljuk ice shelf, you can see a white glare on the distant horizon. This is the Viad Glacier wall, the point where the flow of ice meets the frozen sea. Through the crisp, clear air of Kalte it looks no more than six miles away at most, but in reality it is nearer sixty miles away.</p>
       <p>You make good progress on the first day and as darkness approaches, you decide to set up camp for the night. You halt inside a circle of ice pillars that have been forced upwards by the constantly moving ice shelf. The sledges are drawn together and the tent is erected beside them. Once the canvas is secured and the Kanu-dogs have been settled for the night, you begin to prepare your evening meal. Suddenly, a terrifying roar is heard outside the tent.</p>
       <p><quote>By the gods!</quote> cries Irian. <quote>A Baknar!</quote></p>
       <p>Baknar are large carnivorous creatures that dwell near the Kalte coastline. Their usual prey are gallings or the smaller ostrels that live at the sea<ch.apos/>s edge. But this Baknar has been attracted by the scent of the dogs. It is about to attack and eat several of your sledge dog team.</p>

Dyce is steering it, taking great pains to keep it in the centre of the narrow bridge, when suddenly the two lead Kanu-dogs slip and fall into the gorge. They hang helplessly in their harnesses, howling and kicking at the air. Dyce frantically pulls on the reins to try to prevent the others from falling as well, but his efforts are in vain. One by one, the other four dogs are pulled from the bridge by the increasing weight of those below.</p>
       <p><quote>Jump, Dyce, jump!</quote> screams Irian, as the last dog plummets into the void. Dyce leaps clear just as the sledge topples into the gorge, but he lands on the narrowest section of ice and loses his footing.</p>

Then from the depths of the moat you hear a ghastly, inhuman gibbering. You brace yourself for combat but are totally unprepared for the horror that now faces you. From out of the dark slithers a huge, ghoulish, green monster. Its deformed head is a mass of tentacles and suckers that ooze a putrid black slime. At the centre of this writhing mass a hideous yellow eye pulsates. Vonotar has control over this monster and he is directing it towards you.</p>

       <p>You have been following the Ice Barbarian scouts for nearly two hours when a fierce ice squall rises from the west. The terrain becomes very broken with drifts of snow hiding the razor-sharp ridges and undulations of the ice beneath. For the Ice Barbarian scouts with their skis (fashioned from the ribs of Kalte mammoths), the treacherous surface presents no problems. But to cross it on foot is a slow and painful ordeal.</p>
       <p>The biting wind whips across the glacier, bringing with it clouds of fine snow that obscure your vision. You realize the danger of being caught in the open in the middle of a Kalte blizzard, and signal to the others to call off the chase. Walking towards your scouts, you suddenly plummet through the surface of the ice.</p>

In spite of the freezing temperature, they are badly decomposed; they have obviously been dead for a very long time. Both are attired in furs and one still has a flint dagger grasped in his hand. From the position of the bodies, it looks as if they killed each other in a desperate fight.</p>

       <p>The next day, thick snow clouds have descended over the Ljuk ice shelf and there is little wind. As you draw closer to the edge of the glacier, the surface of the ice shelf becomes very rough and broken. Slabs of solid ice jut out at every angle, forming difficult obstacles.

Seconds later, it has disappeared into the darkness. A quick check of the Kanu-dogs reveals that they are all safe, although still understandably nervous. To ensure that the Baknar does not attack again, you all take it in turns to sit watch that evening, torches and weapons at the ready.</p>

       <p>You have covered less than a mile when the first of the Ice Barbarian scouts appear to the north on skis. At first, there are only two of the fearsome warriors, but they are soon joined by three others. They are large, muscular, and bedecked with furs. Some of them wear bone armour. Despite their size, they glide across the snow with an almost feline grace and speed. Each of them has a pole attached to his back from which a small flag flutters.</p>
       <p>Suddenly, a bone-tipped arrow whistles past your knee and embeds itself in the sledge. An Ice Barbarian scout skis past to your right. He is less than ten yards away and you can clearly see his slanted eyes and sharp cheek-bones. You suddenly realize that what you had mistaken for muscle and fur is in fact an Ice Barbarian child. Each scout is carrying a large backpack containing a small child. These children are armed with small bone bows, and they fire a constant stream of arrows as their fathers ski nearer and nearer.</p>

       <p>The Helghast smoulders and decays at your feet, a vile green gas seeping from beneath its robes. As you stare at the remains, you realize that this creature must have been sent here to kill Vonotar by the Darklords who crave Vonotar<ch.apos/>s death for his failure at the Battle of Holmgulf. The evil wizard must have discovered the Helghast and imprisoned it within a pentagram until he could devise some way of killing it for good.</p>
       <p>You gingerly touch your wounded throat and thank the gods that you wield the Sommerswerd<ch.emdash/>its power has once again saved your life. You turn and quickly descend the stairs, leaving behind the Helghast<ch.apos/>s foul remains.</p>

       <p>You sense that something is very wrong here. There are no mines in Kalte, and, as a result, not only gold but all metals are considered rare and precious. The only means by which Ice Barbarians can obtain metal is by fur trading at Ljuk each summer, and then it is only steel that interests them.

       <p>It takes nearly an hour to cross, but you eventually make it in safety. The ascent of the glacier is a daunting task. The ice wall is smooth but very steep, rising over eight hundred feet. All of the equipment has to be unloaded from the sledges and ferried to the top of the glacier, where it is repacked piece by piece. The Kanu-dogs do hardly anything but fight amongst themselves and your food gets so shaken up, that all that remains to eat that evening is an unsavoury mess.</p>
       <p>On the summit of the glacier wall, you pitch tent in the shelter of a natural ice bowl and settle down to a much deserved rest.</p>

       <p>After a short walk, you arrive at a massive ice hall full of crystal stalagmites and stalactites. The floor is covered with animal tracks and bones, yet the vast hall seems empty and still.

You suddenly realize that you are staring at the foundation stones of Ikaya<ch.emdash/>you have reached the ice fortress.</p>

       <p>The two days that follow are sheer hell. Ridges formed by deeply fissured ice-mounds continually bar your way, and you are forced to dismount and manhandle the sledges across them. Progress is slow. The Kanu-dogs are nervous and take fright at the slightest instance and the sledges frequently capsize and spill their loads.</p>
       <p>A haze of fine snow obscures your vision. On two occasions, Fenor and Irian slip into crevasses and have to be pulled out by their safety ropes. Then your sledge meets with a similar mishap. Dyce volunteers to be lowered into the crevasse on the end of a rope, and unloads the damaged sledge so that it is light enough to be hauled out. After two hours of backbreaking effort, the sledge is dragged from the void, but only for you to discover that it is damaged beyond repair and will have to be abandoned.</p>
       <p>A gale rises from the west, and blows so fiercely that you have difficulty in standing. Within a few minutes, the conditions have become so bad that you are obliged to pitch a tent and wait for the gale to die down. Hour after hour, the wind buffets the tent relentlessly. As you slowly drift off to sleep, you can only dread what the next morning may bring; you are totally unaware of the amazing sight that awaits you.</p>

       <p>After a few hundred yards, you find yourself in a huge cavern that spreads out in all directions as far as the eye can see. You have entered the caverns of Kalte and are now looking at an uncharted world that few Sommlending have ever seen. This massive underground labyrinth was constructed by the Ancients many ages before the Sommlending set foot in Magnamund. Its wide avenues, temples, and arenas once echoed to the sounds of a race of creatures for whom the ice was a natural home. M<ch.apos/>lare bowls still hang from the ceiling bathing the caverns in their eternal light.</p>
       <p>You trek steadily northwards for nearly six hours, until you arrive at the bank of a fast-flowing melt-water river. On the opposite bank, you see a tunnel leading off into the distance.

       <p>The massive door slides open to reveal a long stone causeway, spanning a vast chamber that is bathed in the orange glow of fiery furnaces. A gust of hot, putrid air wafts over you and a deafening noise assails your ears. Fifty feet below the causeway, great stone vats hang suspended over roaring flames. Each vat is full of bubbling slime writhing and contorting as if it were alive.</p>
       <p>Fear and revulsion grip your stomach as you begin to grasp the sinister secret of this hall. Row upon row of stone plinths bear the mutilated corpses of Ice Barbarians, their skins peeled back and pinned open. Each corpse is attended by hideous creatures, a ghoulish legion of mutants crawling and slithering across the blood-drenched floor. This hall is a place of great evil, a nightmarish laboratory, a temple of the Black Art of Necromancy constructed by Vonotar the Traitor.</p>

This beautiful vision reminds you that your Kai masters once told you that the light of Kalte is unlike anywhere else in Magnamund. With tent and equipment packed, you leave the pass and venture out onto the Hrod Basin; one hundred miles of open ice now lie between you and Storm Giant Pass.</p>
       <p>At first, the journey is easy. The Basin has been worn smooth by the wind and no crevasses lurk unseen beneath the hard, dense snow. But at dawn on the third day, events take a turn for the worse. You are awoken from a deep sleep by Dyce shaking your shoulder. He is frightened. <quote>What<ch.apos/>s wrong?</quote> you ask, still bleary-eyed and sleepy.</p>
       <p><quote>Ice Barbarians<ch.ellips/>on the horizon. Twenty, maybe more. Five wind sledges and a warrior escort. I think they<ch.apos/>ve seen us.</quote></p>

Dyce is correct, they are Ice Barbarians and they are heading towards you from the west. <quote>If they catch us, we<ch.apos/>re as good as dead,</quote> says Fenor, as he ties the last of the equipment to the sledge.</p>
       <p>The Ice Barbarians of Kalte are a fierce and war-like race of nomads. For thousands of years they have travelled this icy wasteland, trapping furs and herding mammoths. Their only contact with the rest of Magnamund is through the trading post of Ljuk. In summer, when the coast around Ljuk is free from ice, they journey there to trade their furs for weapons and tools, as there is no iron or wood in Kalte. They hate all except their own kind, and kill anyone they find who dares to trespass in their icy domain. You soon hear their war-cries less than three miles distant, and for the first time since you landed, you pray for a blizzard to hide your escape.</p>

By midday, you are engulfed in a blizzard that makes progress slow and tiring. The howling wind forces you to dismount from your sledge and push it. You feel utterly exhausted. Your hands and toes are numb with the cold; the sweat from your exertions freezes to your skin, lining your boots and mittens with a layer of ice.</p>
       <p>By the time you reach the glacier<ch.apos/>s edge, it is nearly nightfall. You are all so exhausted that you barely have the energy to pitch your tent and eat a meal.

       <p>You can sense the presence of a powerful life-force beyond the misty arch. As you concentrate, you suddenly recall a tale told to you when you were a small child, <quote>The Legend of the Vagadyn Gate</quote>. This was a tale of Ice Demons and how they once fought a war to be able to leave their world and come to Kalte. They were formless creatures, without shape and substance, and existed as pure energy in another dimension, beyond the confines of space and time. The Ice Demons discovered the Vagadyn gate, a sort of door between their world and Magnamund; they fought each other to enter this gate, unaware of the fate that awaited them. The Ancients had also discovered the gate. As the Ice Demons passed through the Vagadyn, their spirits were imprisoned in crystals by the cunning Ancients, who harnessed the power of the Ice Demons to build Ikaya. The M<ch.apos/>lare bowls that light the fortress each contain the spirits of lesser Ice Demons trapped within. You also remember that the tale warns against destroying the crystal prisons: if an Ice Demon is released it will seek to claim the body of its rescuer.</p>

       <p>Your journey to Anskaven is swift, but you are saddened by your memories of the brave guides that were left behind. Your arrival in the port is greeted by an anxious crowd. They fear that your early return is a sign of your mission<ch.apos/>s failure. When the news of Vonotar<ch.apos/>s capture becomes known, your warrior skills are required once again; this time in the defence of your enemy against the seething mob of outraged Sommlending that assault Anskaven gaol. Safe passage is eventually secured to Toran, where trial awaits the traitor.</p>
       <p>Upon the dawn of the feast of Maesmarn, in the depths of the Guildhall of the Crystal Star, Vonotar the Traitor is tried by his brotherhood and found guilty of his terrible crimes. He is led away in silence to the deepest chamber of the Guildhall, wherein lies the Daziarn: a portal of total darkness, the door of an eternal prison from which there can be no escape.<footref id="sect350-1" idref="sect350-1-foot"/></p>
