<p><strong>Melvyn Grant</strong> was born in London, England, and expressed a talent for art from a very early age. He became the only student to attend The Brassey Institute School of Fine Arts at the early age of twelve. Although his approach to painting is firmly rooted in traditional Fine Art, he finds much more excitement in the world of High-end Fantasy Illustration. Melvyn maintains a <a href="&link.melvyn.grant.website;">website</a> showcasing his art.</p>
