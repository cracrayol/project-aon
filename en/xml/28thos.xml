     <p>It is early summer in the year MS<ch.nbsp/>5085 and you are a Grand Master of the New Order of the Kai, the warrior <ch.eacute/>lite of Sommerlund.</p>

     <p>Thirty-five years ago, the First Order of the Kai was massacred by the Darklords of Helgedad, a host of powerful creatures sent by the evil God Naar to destroy the world of Magnamund. Lone Wolf, the supreme leader of your illustrious fighting order, was the only survivor of their attack upon the Kai. As a young initiate he stood amidst the burning wreckage of the old Kai Monastery and vowed to avenge the slaughter of his comrades. Twenty years later he kept his pledge when alone he infiltrated the foul domain of the Darklords and destroyed their infernal city of Helgedad, the base of their evil power.</p>

     <p>With the destruction of Helgedad, chaos befell the Darkland armies who had, until then, been poised to conquer all Magnamund. Quickly their disorder escalated into a mutinous civil war, allowing the Freeland Alliance armies of Magnamund time in which to recover and launch a successful counter-offensive. Against all odds, a swift and total victory was secured over the feuding armies of evil.</p>

     <p>Following the demise of the Darklords, peace reigned in your homeland of Sommerlund. Under the direction of Lone Wolf, the ruined Monastery of the Kai was rebuilt and restored to its former glory and a New Order was established. You are one of this new generation of Kai recruits. You were born in Sommerlund in the year MS<ch.nbsp/>5063, during the time of the war against the Darklords. When you were seven years old you were sent by your father to the Kai Monastery. There, under the tutelage of Lone Wolf, you developed your martial skills and honed the special Kai abilities which lay dormant within you. Your skills were nurtured and sharpened to perfection by years of study and rigorous training. Your exceptional talents helped you to master all of the Kai and Magnakai Disciplines, and you rose swiftly through the ranks of the New Order to become one of only five who now hold the high rank of Kai Grand Master. It is an achievement that has brought great honour upon you and your family.</p>

     <p>In the year MS<ch.nbsp/>5077, your skill and courage were put to the test when an attack was launched upon the Kai Monastery during Lone Wolf<ch.apos/>s absence. By means of a Shadow Gate (an astral corridor between the physical world of Sommerlund and the many ethereal domains which lie beyond it), Naar sent forth a host of dragon-creatures to besiege the monastery and lay waste to all Sommerlund. He had chosen his time well, yet his evil plan was thwarted by the tenacious defence that you and your fellow warriors maintained until the siege was raised by Lone Wolf and the King<ch.apos/>s Army of Sommerlund.<footref id="tssf-1" idref="tssf-1-foot"/></p>

     <p>During the seven years since the defeat of his minions, Naar has sought vengeance upon the Kai. He commands many agents of evil upon Magnamund, and they wait quietly in the shadows for the chance to serve their fell master.</p>

     <p>Less than a month ago, Lord Rimoah of Dessi came to the Kai Monastery aboard the flying ship <cite>Cloud-dancer</cite>. This wise counsellor is one of the Elder Magi, an ancient race of goodly magicians who have remained steadfastly loyal to the Kai for many centuries. His visit was unexpected and you sensed at once that something was wrong. Lone Wolf summoned you to his chamber where, with mounting dread, you listened to Lord Rimoah<ch.apos/>s account of events in Southern Magnamund which threatened to destroy the fragile peace of that distant continent.</p>

     <p>The Elder Magi had received word that Autarch Sejanoz, the evil ruler of Bhanar, had secretly dispatched a squad of his personal guards into the Doomlands of Naaros. At first, the Elders could not fathom a reason why the Autarch had done this. The Doomlands are one of the most inhospitable regions in all of Magnamund, a barren wasteland of ash and cinder that was the domain of Agarash the Damned. At its centre his mighty fortress-city of Naaros once stood. Yet, following his defeat by the Elder Magi, all that remains of it now is a titanic chasm of molten lava and heat-fused rock. Loyal rangers were dispatched to the Doomlands to spy on the Autarch<ch.apos/>s men and attempt to discover their true purpose. After many weeks spent tracking their prey, they observed them excavating an unmarked burial mound near to the ruins of Naaros. Within this mound the Autarch<ch.apos/>s men discovered the Claw of Naar.</p>

     <p>The Claw of Naar is an ancient wand of power crafted by the evil God himself. It was used by Agarash the Damned during his conquest of Magnamund. Legend held that it had been lost forever in the molten ruin of Naaros, but now it had resurfaced, and its return boded ill for the peaceable New Kingdoms bordering the Autocracy of Bhanar.</p>

     <p>The rangers reported that the Autarch<ch.apos/>s squad were returning to Bhanar with the Claw in their possession. Their chosen route would take them through the Southern Dammerdon Mountains, and so the rangers went ahead to hide themselves in a gorge called Sunderer Pass, where they awaited their arrival. Their plan was to ambush the squad in the narrow confines of the pass and steal the Claw. However, the ranger leader was wisely anxious that the power of the Claw might overwhelm his small group, and so he requested that help be sent urgently. Rimoah responded in turn by seeking the aid of the Kai.</p>

     <p><quote>I have come to ask for the help of the Kai,</quote> said Rimoah. <quote>We of the Elder Magi have the power and the means to destroy the Claw of Naar, but only when we have that accursed object in our possession. To secure the Claw will require skills and courage that only the Kai possess. And, so, I come here seeking your aid, Supreme Master.</quote></p>

     <p><quote>It will not be an easy task,</quote> replied Lone Wolf, <quote>but we have the advantage of both speed and surprise. Sunderer Pass is no more than a day<ch.apos/>s journey away by skyship.</quote></p>

     <p><quote>Aye,</quote> replied Rimoah, <quote>but we must depart this afternoon if we are to be certain of reaching the pass before the arrival of the Autarch<ch.apos/>s squad.</quote></p>

     <p>Lone Wolf had been tempted to accept the challenge himself, yet he was committed to urgent duties at the King<ch.apos/>s court and so he requested that you journey to Bhanar in his stead and help Lord Rimoah to secure the Claw of Naar. You accepted the mission without hesitation and, within the hour, you found yourself standing beside Rimoah at the deck-rail of the sleek flying ship <cite>Cloud-dancer</cite>, watching the Kai Monastery shrink away into the distance as the craft soared into a clear blue sky.</p>

     <p>By late afternoon of the following day, you reached Sunderer Pass and made contact with the rangers. Their leader informed you that a trap had been set to ensnare the enemy and their foul relic as they came through the pass. However, this ambush went badly wrong, and in the ensuing chaos you were separated from Lord Rimoah when <cite>Cloud-dancer</cite> was attacked by a horde of winged horrors that swarmed from out of the Doomlands. In the ensuing battle Lord Rimoah was forced to flee.</p>

     <p>Despite this serious setback to your mission, you resolved to press on and attempt to deny Autarch Sejanoz the Claw of Naar. Aided by the rangers, you pursued the Autarch<ch.apos/>s men and captured the Claw. Yet this success proved to be only temporary, for the Claw was soon snatched back and hurriedly conveyed to the Bhanarian city of Yua Tzhan. In a daring raid upon the military barracks of that formidable city, you and your brave comrades succeeded in stealing it back once more. A daring flight to the friendly land of Chai ensued where, in the border town of Zuda, you were confronted by the Autarch himself. A desperate fight took place here, during which your ranger companions were slain by the evil tyrant. Yet their sacrifice was not in vain, for you were able to maintain possession of the Claw and effect a successful escape to Fort Jhung, a nearby Chai stronghold, where you were unexpectedly reunited with Lord Rimoah. You delivered to him the Claw of Naar and he vowed that the accursed artefact would be destroyed by the Elder Magi to prevent it from ever falling into the hands of Autarch Sejanoz.</p>

     <p>Soon after your reunion with Rimoah, you journeyed together to the Chai capital of Pensei aboard <cite>Cloud-dancer</cite> where you were greeted and f<ch.ecirc/>ted by the court of Khea-khan Xo-lin, Chai<ch.apos/>s venerable ruler. However, it was during these festivities that calamitous news arrived at the Khea-khan<ch.apos/>s palace: Autarch Sejanoz had begun a massive invasion of Chai.</p>

     <p>The tyrant<ch.apos/>s armies were swarming across the borders, sweeping all resistance before them. In the west the strongholds of Fort Jhung and Fort Xian had fallen. In the south, a vast seaborne invasion force had established a beachhead near to the port of Valus and swiftly overrun the ill-defended city of Dwala. Messengers were arriving at the palace with grim regularity to report the latest defeat. From these reports it quickly became clear that the Autarch<ch.apos/>s main objective was the capture of Pensei itself.</p>

     <p>Fearing that the Claw of Naar could yet fall into the Autarch<ch.apos/>s hands, Lord Rimoah resolved to journey at once to Dessi aboard <cite>Cloud-dancer</cite>. Fearing for the safety of their aged Khea-khan, the courtiers of Pensei pleaded with their beloved ruler to flee to the safety of distant Dessi with Rimoah. But the Khea-khan steadfastly refused their requests, fearing that he would be thought a coward if he were to abandon his land and his subjects in this hour of approaching darkness.</p>

     <p>Despite the pleas of his advisors and his family, the obstinate Xo-lin vowed to remain in Pensei. He put his faith in the skill and tenacity of his famous Imperial Guardsmen, believing that these warriors would halt the advancing Bhanarian armies. But when news arrived of their defeat and decimation in a battle at the town of Vabou, little more than a hundred miles south of Pensei, suddenly a terrible realization struck the aged ruler. There were now too few Chai warriors left to prevent the enemy legions from seizing the capital and enslaving its citizens. With heavy heart, the Khea-khan reluctantly agreed to leave Pensei. Yet, resolutely, he refused to go with Lord Rimoah. Instead, he ordered his courtiers to prepare a caravan of horse-drawn carriages for the speedy evacuation of himself, his family, and selected members of his court entourage. They would journey east, following the trade route to the Lissanian city of Tazhan. Here the Khea-khan could be sure of finding sanctuary in this New Kingdom stronghold. Upon his arrival he would rally the armies of his loyal allies and then return with them, across the vastness of the Great Lissan Plain, to free his land and its people from the Autarch<ch.apos/>s ruthless occupation.</p>

     <p>Fearing for the safety of the Khea-khan, and the disastrous consequences that will befall the New Kingdoms if he should be captured by the enemy, Lord Rimoah urged you to accompany Xo-lin<ch.apos/>s entourage. Your experience and your Kai skills could be crucial to their survival during the seventeen days that it will take for them to reach the city of Tazhan. Once the Claw of Naar is safely in Dessi, Rimoah promised to return and journey directly to Tazhan by skyship. There he will inform its ruling council of the Bhanarian invasion, and try to elicit their martial support in readiness for Xo-lin<ch.apos/>s arrival.</p>

     <p>You agreed to Rimoah<ch.apos/>s request to escort the aged ruler, and as the court of the Khea-khan began hasty preparation for the evacuation of the palace, you bade farewell to Lord Rimoah.</p>

     <p><quote>Until we meet again in Tazhan, Grand Master,</quote> he said, solemnly, <quote>I shall pray to Ishir to watch over you on the road that you must travel. It is vital that Xo-lin arrives in Tazhan alive. He is the only one who can rally the New Kingdoms to rise up and repel the Bhanarians. Without him, I fear, the New Kingdoms will fall to the inexorable might of Sejanoz.</quote></p>

      <p>If you have completed any previous <cite>Lone Wolf New Order</cite> adventures, remember to choose an additional Grand Master Discipline and add <ch.plus/>1 to your basic <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> and <ch.plus/>2 to your basic <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> for each adventure you successfully completed (cf. <a idref="discplnz">Grand Master Disciplines</a>).</p>

    <data>
     <p>You keep a record of your adventure on the <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
     <p>During the years you have spent in training at the Kai Monastery, you have devoted yourself to further developing your fighting prowess (<typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ>) and physical stamina (<typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ>). Before you begin this <cite>New Order</cite> adventure you need to measure how effective your training has been. To do this take a pencil and, with your eyes closed, point the blunt end of it onto the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a>. If you pick a 0 it counts as zero.</p>
     <p>The first number that you pick from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> in this way represents your <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ>. Add 25 to the number you picked and write the total in the <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> section of your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a> (i.e. if your pencil fell on the number 7 in the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> you would write in a <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> of 32). When you fight, your <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> will be pitted against that of your enemy. A high score in this section is therefore desirable.</p>
     <p>The second number that you pick from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> represents your powers of <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ>. Add 30 to this number and write the total in the <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> section of your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a> (i.e. if your pencil fell on the number 8 on the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> you would have 38 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points).</p>
     <p>If you are wounded in combat you will lose <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points. If at any time your <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points fall to zero or below, you are dead and the adventure is over. Lost <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points can be regained during the course of the adventure, but your number of <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points cannot rise above the number you have when you start an adventure.</p>
     <p>If you have successfully completed previous adventures in the <cite>Lone Wolf New Order</cite> series (Books 21<ch.endash/>27), you can carry your current scores of <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> and <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points over to this adventure.<footref id="gamerulz-1" idref="gamerulz-1-foot"/> You may also carry over any Special Items, Kai Weapon, normal Weapons, and Backpack Items you had in your possession at the end of your last adventure, and these should be entered on your new <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
     <p><strong>Playing Tip:</strong> You may use a 10-sided die instead of the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> if you find it more convenient.</p>

       <p>It has long been the tradition of your <ch.eacute/>lite warrior caste to bestow a new name upon each young novice when they complete their first year<ch.apos/>s training at the Kai Monastery. Kai names are chosen by senior Kai Masters with the aim of reflecting the individual strengths and qualities of each novice.</p>
       <p>You may create your own Kai name for yourself, or you can generate a Kai name at random using the name tables below. To generate a Kai name, pick a number from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> and consult Table A. The name which corresponds to the number you have picked is the first part, or prefix, of your Kai name. Now pick a second number from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> and consult Table B. The name which corresponds to the number you have picked is the second part, or suffix, of your Kai name. Put the prefix and the suffix together and you have your own personal Kai name.</p>

         <p>Following in the footsteps of Lone Wolf himself, you have vowed that one day you will become totally proficient in all 16 of the New Order Kai Grand Master Disciplines.

         <p>If this is the first <cite>New Order</cite> adventure you have undertaken, then your present rank is that of Kai Grand Master Senior. This means that you have mastered <em>five</em> of the New Order Grand Master Disciplines listed below. It is for you to decide which five Disciplines these are. As all of the New Order Grand Master Disciplines may be of use to you at some point during your mission, pick these five skills with care.

       <p>Before you leave the Kai Monastery to accompany the Khea-khan of Chai, you equip yourself with a <a idref="map">map of the Great Lissan Plain and its surrounding territories</a> and a pouch of gold. To find out how much gold is in the pouch, pick a number from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> and add 20 to the number you have picked. The total equals the number of Gold Crowns inside the pouch, and you should now enter this number in the <quote>Gold Crowns</quote> section of your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
       <p>If you have successfully completed previous <cite>New Order</cite> adventures (Books 21<ch.endash/>27), you may add this sum to the number of Crowns you already possess. Fifty is the maximum number of Gold Crowns you can carry in your pouch at any time. You may also select five items from the list below, only two of which may be Weapons.<footref id="equipmnt-1" idref="equipmnt-1-foot"/></p>

        <data>
         <p>Upon reaching the ultimate rank of Kai Supreme Master, Lone Wolf received as a reward from the God Kai many new skills and abilities. One of these skills was Kai Weaponcraft. Using his newfound mastery, Lone Wolf forged ten weapons of magical power in the armoury furnaces of the Kai Monastery. These magical weapons are reserved for the <ch.eacute/>lite of the New Order Kai who attain the rank of Grand Master.</p>

         <p>In recognition of your rank and achievement, you may choose your own Kai Weapon from the table below or, if you prefer, you can generate one at random. To generate a Kai Weapon, pick a number from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> and consult the first column. The magical Axe, Sword, or Broadsword which corresponds to the number you have picked will be your own personal Kai Weapon. Record this magical weapon and its unique properties in the Kai Weapon section of the <a idref="action">Special Items List</a>.<footref id="equipmnt-2" idref="equipmnt-2-foot"/></p>

         <p><strong>Example</strong></p>
         <p>Say you choose the number 1 from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a>, your Kai Weapon will be the Axe <quote>Alema</quote>.</p>

         <p>When using this Kai Weapon in normal combat you may add <ch.plus/>5 points to your <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ>. Each Kai Weapon has a unique property. When you use your Kai Weapon in combat against the type of enemy that matches its unique property, or use it at the optimum time or location, then you may add the higher bonus to your <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> (these bonuses are not cumulative).</p>

         <p><strong>Example</strong></p>
         <p>If you were to use <quote>Alema</quote> in combat against an undead enemy, you could add the higher bonus of <ch.plus/>7 to your <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ>. If you were to fight a living enemy using this weapon then the bonus to your <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> would remain at <ch.plus/>5.</p>

      <data>
       <p>There will be occasions during your adventure when you will have to fight an enemy. The enemy<ch.apos/>s <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> and <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points are given in the text. Your aim in the combat is to kill the enemy by reducing his <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points to zero while losing as few <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points as possible yourself.</p>
       <p>At the start of a combat, enter your own and the enemy<ch.apos/>s <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points in the appropriate boxes on the Combat Record section of your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
       <p>The sequence for combat is as follows:</p>
       <ol class="paragraphed">
        <li><p>Add any extra points gained through your Grand Master Disciplines and Special Items to your current <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> total.</p></li>
        <li>
         <p>Subtract the <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> of your enemy from this total. The result is your Combat Ratio. Enter it on the <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
         <p>Example</p>
         <p>You, Grand Master (<typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> 32), are attacked in a forest by a pack of Wild Dogs (<typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> 31). You are taken by surprise and are not given the opportunity of evading their attack. You possess the Grand Master Discipline of Kai-surge to which the Wild Dogs are not immune, so you add 8 points to your <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ>. You also possess the Kai Weapon <quote>Ulnarias</quote>, so you add an additional 5 points to your <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ>. This gives you a total <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> of 45.</p>
         <p>You now subtract the Wild Dogs<ch.apos/> <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> from your own, giving a Combat Ratio of <ch.plus/>14 (45<ch.minus/>31=<ch.plus/>14). <ch.plus/>14 is noted on your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a> as the Combat Ratio.</p>
        </li>
        <li><p><a id="stage3">When you have your Combat Ratio</a>, pick a number from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a>.</p></li>
        <li>
         <p>Turn to the <a idref="crtable">Combat Results Table</a>. Along the top of the chart are shown the Combat Ratio numbers. Find the number that is the same as your Combat Ratio and cross-reference it with the random number that you have picked (the random numbers appear on the side of the chart). You now have the number of <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points lost by both yourself and your enemy in this round of combat. (E represents points lost by the enemy; GM represents points lost by yourself<ch.emdash/>Grand Master.)</p>
         <p>Example</p>
         <p>The Combat Ratio between you and the Wild Dogs has been established as <ch.plus/>14. If the number picked from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> is 1, then the result of the first round of combat is:</p>

         <p>During your adventure you may be given the chance to evade combat. If you have already engaged in a round of combat and decide to evade, calculate the combat for that round in the usual manner. All points lost by the enemy as a result of that round are ignored, and you make your escape. Only <strong>you</strong> may lose <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points during that round (such is the risk of turning tail and running away during combat!).

          <dt>Animal Mastery</dt>
           <dd><p>Kai Grand Master Superiors who possess this Discipline are able to deter predatory animals in the wild by exuding a scent which is repellent to them. In order for this improved Discipline to work effectively, a Kai Grand Master Superior must be aware of the species of predatory animal he/she wishes to deter.

          <dt>Assimilance</dt>
           <dd><p>Kai Grand Master Superiors who possess this skill are able to create a noise and project it up to 15 yards away from their location. The noise is akin to the rumbling sound of thunder and it can be used to distract or divert an enemy<ch.apos/>s attention. This improved Discipline requires a degree of preparation and therefore it cannot be used during combat.</p></dd>
          <dt>Astrology</dt>
           <dd><p>Kai Grand Master Superiors who possess this Discipline are skilled in the use of all mechanical devices designed to measure and/or observe the cosmology of Magnamund. Such devices include sextants, astrolabes, and orreries.</p></dd>
          <dt>Herbmastery</dt>
           <dd><p>Kai Grand Master Superiors who have this Discipline are able to purify water, thereby making contaminated or briny water suitable for consumption.

          <dt>Elementalism</dt>
           <dd><p>Kai Grand Master Superiors who possess this skill are able to condense pure water out of the surrounding air. This water can be made to fall as a fine spray or as a sudden deluge.

          <dt>Telegnosis</dt>
           <dd><p>Sun Knights who possess this Discipline are able to communicate telepathically over great distances. Initially the range of this ability is approximately 100 miles, but this distance increases as a Grand Master rises in rank.</p></dd>

The effect of the spell lasts for 2<ch.endash/>3 seconds, allowing the Sun Knight time in which to move away from the missile<ch.apos/>s line of flight. Initially only one missile can be affected by this spell, but the number increases as a Grand Master rises in rank.</li>

          <dt>Grand Weaponmastery</dt>
           <dd><p>Sun Lords with this Discipline are able to cause the metal edge of any non-magical weapon to ignite and burn fiercely. When a Weapon thus affected is used in combat, it inflicts an additional 1 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> point loss upon an enemy in every successful round of combat. This ability cannot be used with a wholly wooden Weapon such as a Quarterstaff.</p></dd>
          <dt>Herbmastery</dt>
           <dd><p>Sun Lords who possess this Discipline are able to cause living plants, e.g. grasses, bushes, flowers, weeds, rushes, to entwine themselves around the limbs of hostile creatures, thereby hampering their free movement. Sun Lords are able to target only one creature in this way. An additional creature can be affected for every level a Grand Master rises above the rank of Sun Lord.</p></dd>
          <dt>Assimilance</dt>
           <dd><p>Sun Lords who possess this skill are able to cause the outline of their bodies to become blurred and indistinct. By so doing, they can greatly increase their chances of avoiding magical and/or non-magical missiles directed at them.</p></dd>

           <dd><p>Kai Sun Lords with this skill are able to see, with acute accuracy, light in the infrared spectrum, i.e. they can see the complex patterns generated by heat in near or total darkness. They can also see light in the ultraviolet spectrum.</p></dd>
          <dt>Kai-surge</dt>
           <dd><p>Sun Lords who possess mastery of this Discipline are able to launch a Kai-blast<ch.emdash/>a pulse of intense psychic energy which is capable of affecting both psychically active and inactive enemies. This form of psychic attack is very effective, more so than a usual Kai-surge, Psi-surge, or Mindblast. It can cause an enemy to lose between 2 and 18 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points in one attack. A Kai Sun Lord using Kai-blast determines the damage inflicted on an enemy by picking two numbers from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a>. These numbers should be added together (a <quote>0</quote> = 1) and the resultant total equals the damage inflicted. However, use of a Kai-blast will reduce a Sun Lord<ch.apos/>s <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points total by 4. It cannot be used in conjunction with any other form of psychic attack.</p></dd>

              <li><spell>Energy Grasp</spell><ch.emdash/>This spell enables a Sun Lord to discharge a powerful electrical force into anything he or she touches. It is similar in effect to the Brotherhood Spell <spell>Lightning Hand</spell>. It differs in that it is easier to control and channel the resulting energy. It also requires the actual touching of an object or enemy to effect the spell.</li>

By the use of a hypnotic stare, they are able to cause susceptible creatures (up to three individuals at any one time) willingly to carry out their orders. The number of creatures so affected<ch.emdash/>and the duration of the effect<ch.emdash/>increases steadily as a Sun Thane advances in Kai rank.</p></dd>

           <dd><p>Sun Thanes with this Discipline are able to command an animal to fall asleep at will.

          <dt>Elementalism</dt>
           <dd><p>Sun Thanes who possess this Discipline are able to accelerate greatly the oxidation (rusting) of ferrous metals simply by touch alone. The longer the metallic item is touched by a Sun Thane, the more damaging will be the effect.</p></dd>
          <dt>Grand Pathsmanship</dt>
           <dd><p>Sun Thanes who possess mastery of this Discipline are able to alter the temperature of water by touch. By using this skill they are able to transform water into ice and vice versa. The volume of water affected and the duration of effect both increase as a Grand Master rises in rank.</p></dd>
          <dt>Kai-screen</dt>
           <dd><p>Sun Thanes who possess this Discipline are able to erect a special psychic defence called <spell>Mindfort</spell>. A <spell>Mindfort</spell> defence greatly reduces the effects of any psychic shock that would normally paralyse or weaken a lesser mortal.</p></dd>
          <dt>Kai-alchemy</dt>
           <dd>
            <p>Grand Masters who have reached the rank of Sun Thane are able to use the following Brotherhood Spells:</p>

The duration of the spell is limited at first, but it steadily increases as a Grand Master rises in rank.</li>
              <li><spell>Breathe Water</spell><ch.emdash/>Using this spell, a Kai Sun Thane is able to breathe underwater for ten minutes. The duration of effect increases as a Grand Master rises in rank.</li>

     <p>Grand Master, you are about to embark upon a difficult and dangerous mission. The aged Khea-khan of Chai is one of Sommerlund<ch.apos/>s oldest and most venerable allies. He is physically frail, yet he is revered almost like a god by his loyal subjects. Only he can rally the New Kingdoms to rise up and defy the mighty armies of Autarch Sejanoz. He must be escorted swiftly and safely to Tazhan, for if he is captured or slain by the enemy then all hopes for peace in Southern Magnamund will be dashed.</p>

     <p>During your mission you may encounter many strong and wily adversaries. Your journey across the Great Lissan Plain will be fraught with danger at every turn, so remain on your guard at all times.</p>

     <p>Some of the material items that you find will be of use to you, but others may be red herrings of no real value at all. If you discover items during your mission, be selective in what you choose to keep. Pick your initial five Grand Master Disciplines with care for a wise choice will enable anyone to complete the quest, no matter how weak their initial <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> and <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> scores may be. Completion of previous <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> adventures (Books 1<ch.endash/>27) may be advantageous, but it is not essential for the successful completion of this <cite>New Order</cite> adventure.</p>

     <p>May the Gods Kai and Ishir guide and protect you during your vital mission.</p>

     <p>For Sommerlund and the Kai!</p>

       <p>An electric hum fills the throne room of the Khea-khan<ch.apos/>s palace as the chosen courtiers and guards make swift preparation for the evacuation to Tazhan. In the midst of all this frantic activity, the aged ruler of Chai sits upon his ebony throne and confers with his trusted advisor, Kau-Doshin, the head of the Imperial Palace household. The lines etched deeply upon their faces convey the gravity of the hushed words that pass between them.</p>
       <p>In a far corner of the chamber you see Princess Mitzu consoling her tearful son, the five-year-old Prince Kamada. He is the Khea-khan<ch.apos/>s great-great-grandson, and he is next in line to rule Chai upon the death of venerable Xo-lin. Having comforted him and dried his tears, Princess Mitzu places the young boy into the charge of his matronly tutor, Shavane. Then Mitzu leaves the throne room, passing by Guard Captain Chan who is entering through its grand arched doorway. Dutifully, he clicks his heels and salutes as the Princess glides past him with regal grace.</p>
       <p>Chan scans the throne room and narrows his sharp almond eyes when he catches sight of you. The Guard Captain will be responsible for the personal safety of the Imperial Family during the overland journey to Tazhan, and as he strides across the throne room towards you, it is easy to see why this <ch.eacute/>lite warrior has been entrusted with such an unenviable task.</p>
       <p><quote>Hail, Grand Master,</quote> he booms in greeting. <quote>It pleases me greatly that you have chosen to accompany us to Tazhan. I welcome your valued assistance.</quote></p>
       <p>You return Chan<ch.apos/>s formal compliment and then ask him when the Imperial Caravan will be leaving.</p>
       <p><quote>Within the hour, my lord,</quote> he replies. He pauses to wipe away a trickle of sweat from the brow of his wide oval head, and then he says in a quieter tone: <quote>I see you possess a fine Kai blade.</quote> His eyes glitter as he looks upon the Kai Weapon that is sheathed at your side. <quote>As you can see, I am myself unarmed. Before we depart I must visit the Imperial Palace Armoury and equip myself. Would you care to accompany me? I trust you<ch.apos/>ll be impressed by the quality of Chai weaponry, and you<ch.apos/>ll be very welcome to take any item you find desirable.</quote></p>

       <p>Captain Chan orders that lighted torches be dropped into the bore holes. His troopers comply, and soon you feel the tremors of explosions that occur when these burning brands ignite other Nahba Worms hidden deep in their underground burrows.</p>
       <p>Chan details every trooper to stand watch for the remainder of this night in case any worms have escaped the destruction. Fortunately for them it is a short watch; the sun breaks the eastern horizon within the hour, and soon afterwards the caravan is ready to leave this treacherous valley.</p>

       <p>Six swarthy-faced tomb robbers emerge from the crypt, carrying sacks filled to bursting with stolen burial ornaments and treasures. As they clumsily load their ill-gotten gains onto their wagon, you take cover behind a fan-shaped tombstone. Suddenly the soft ground shifts beneath your feet and you feel yourself sinking. You grab the tombstone to steady yourself but, as you do so, you let slip a stifled cry of alarm. To your dismay, the robbers hear your cry and come rushing back to the graveyard to investigate.</p>

       <p>After the blazing heat of the plains, the dark coolness of the catacombs comes as a blessed relief to the aged Khea-khan and his family. Kau-Doshin oversees the transfer of Xo-lin and his entourage from the caravan to their underground abode, and Kasarian helps make his imperial guests as comfortable as possible. When all of the family and the entourage are safely underground, Chan posts guards at the great stone portal.</p>

       <p><quote>I shall endeavour to, your majesty,</quote> you reply, uneasily. You ask Mitzu for some details about the Prince, such as the place, the date, and the time of his birth. Then you look out across the balcony to the night sky and see that the stars are partially obscured by low clouds, driven on by a stiff easterly breeze. Conditions are far from ideal, but there are sufficient breaks in these scudding clouds for you to be able to discern the position of the constellations. Using your astrological knowledge of the heavens, and the information supplied by Mitzu, you discover to your dismay that the stars hold a disturbing prediction for her young son<ch.apos/>s future.</p>

       <p>The fight comes to an abrupt end when you deal the last living creature a mighty blow to the base of its deformed head. As it falls lifelessly to the ground, Sergeant Yeng rushes to check that his men have also survived intact. Cautiously you inspect the bodies of the slain beasts and quickly determine that all three are of Agarashi descent. They have probably come down from the Hyunsei foothills in a desperate search for prey, for the corpses are emaciated by hunger. Sergeant Yeng confirms your suspicions. He tells you that long ago, during the Age of Eternal Night, this land was stalked by Agarashi<ch.emdash/>the hellish creations of Agarash the Damned. When Agarash was destroyed by the Elder Magi, his creations were scattered across the wilderness and plains of Chai. The descendants of these beasts are still alive today, hiding in hills, burrows, and caves. They do not usually attack travellers unless driven by disease or famine.</p>
       <p>Using your tracking skills, you quickly determine that there are no other creatures like these in this vicinity. Only then do you and the troopers remount your horses and continue along the highway towards the Javai Forest. A few miles short of the forest you discover a freshwater spring which is forded by the highway. It is an ideal site for a night camp, and so you send one of Yeng<ch.apos/>s men back to the caravan to tell them that you shall await their arrival here.</p>
       <p>During your wait for the caravan, unless you possess the Discipline of Grand Huntmastery, you must now eat a Meal or lose 3 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points.</p>

       <p>Once you have rounded up your horses, you return to the caravan and report what has happened to the Khea-khan<ch.apos/>s advisor, Kau-Doshin. The wise old counsellor tells Chan that the column must continue east along the highway without further delay. Going by the descriptions of the creatures that you encountered in the copse, he determines that they were Krakalla, a powerful breed of Agarashi he thought resided only in the Dammerdon Mountains, north of Bhanar. <quote>I fear they may be part of the Autarch<ch.apos/>s army,</quote> he says. <quote>If my suspicions prove correct, then we are in far graver danger than I dared imagine.</quote></p>
       <p>Galvanized by his encounter with the fearsome Krakalla, Chan wastes no time in getting the caravan rolling once more. Later, an overnight camp is pitched on the highway itself, near a sleepy hamlet called Sansei, and the following day you make swift progress on the sun-baked highway.</p>
       <p>Shortly before noon of the third day of your journey to Rakholi, the caravan column crests the rim of a wide valley that lies 50 miles from the banks of the Tkukoma. Spread out before you now is the Vale of Nahba, a spectacularly strange region of the Chai Plain that is punctuated with hundreds of bore holes and geysers. Great columns of steam and scalding water are hurled skywards, driven by the pressure of gases escaping from deep below the surface. Some of the fissures descend for miles, passing close to the planet<ch.apos/>s molten core.</p>
       <p>The highway traverses this alien landscape and, as darkness approaches, you find yourself at a place near the eastern rim of the vale. A night camp is established here among the bubbling pools and hollows, and an evening meal of poached eggs and steamed fish is prepared. After supper, you settle down and try to get some sleep, despite the constant distraction of the eerie noises that echo across this strange valley.</p>

Cautiously you draw back the bolt and tug on the door handle. As it creaks open, you are assailed by a revolting smell that even your Magnakai Discipline of Nexus cannot counter. Burying your mouth and nose in the sleeve of your tunic, you take your first tentative step into the gloomy chamber beyond.</p>

       <p>As the bandit falls dead at your feet, Sergeant Yeng and his comrade come crashing through the foliage and leap into the hide. Yeng is amazed that you have put paid to the bandits so quickly, and when he turns them over with the toe of his boot, he quickly identifies them as members of the gang led by Captain Kronar<ch.emdash/>the renegade Chai army officer. Yeng raises his sword to finish off the unconscious bandit but you stay his hand.</p>

Captain Chan is anxious to question the man, and he orders Yeng to throw a pail of cold spring water over him, but this fails to revive the unconscious bandit. Then you approach the man and use your Kai healing skills in an attempt to restore him to consciousness. A small circle of curious courtiers gather to watch, and they gasp with amazement when he suddenly awakes with a start. With fear-filled eyes, the man returns the stares of his captors and begins to beg for mercy.</p>
       <p>Sergeant Yeng slaps his face with the back of his calloused hand and demands that he identify himself. Immediately, the bandit clamps his jaw shut and refuses to utter another sound.

       <p>Once you are a safe distance from the wooded rise, you glance back over your shoulder to check that Kronar and his bandit gang are not in pursuit of the caravan. Your senses detect that the road behind is clear and you tell Chan of this. He is greatly relieved that the Imperial Caravan has been spared Kronar<ch.apos/>s attack. The bandit leader has a notorious reputation for murdering anyone who witnesses his acts of highway robbery.</p>
       <p>After the drama of the confrontation with Captain Kronar, you are thankful that the rest of the day passes uneventfully. It is early evening when the caravan arrives at Javai, a fortified Chai trading town positioned on the rim of a fertile plateau. Chan negotiates with the guards at the town<ch.apos/>s west gate and the caravan is allowed to enter. You pass along a bustling street, bordered by two-storey wooden dwellings, which leads to the walled chateau of Javai<ch.apos/>s mayoress, Madame Omaki. Here the caravan draws to a halt in the middle of a flagstoned courtyard, ringed by plum trees. A plump woman with gleaming coiffured hair emerges from the chateau and greets Captain Chan. You can tell by their jovial exchange that they are old friends. Chan swears her to secrecy about the presence of the Khea-khan, and she dutifully instructs her servants to secure all the entrances and exits to her estate.</p>

Suddenly you hear the sound of giant stone cogs and the rattle of heavy chains. You glance upwards to see that the ceiling is beginning to descend. As it moves closer, you can tell that it is not stained with soot after all. It is dried blood, the blood of countless men who have unwittingly fallen victim to this devilish trap.</p>

       <p>You leave the <foreign xml:lang="x-chaian">yansi</foreign> and return at the gallop to the caravan. The repair of the damaged wheel has nearly been completed, and within the hour the column is moving eastwards once again. An overnight camp is pitched on the highway itself, near a sleepy hamlet called Sansei, and the following day you make good progress on the sun-baked trade road to Rakholi.</p>
       <p>Shortly before noon of the third day of your journey to the tented city, the caravan column crests the rim of a wide valley that lies 50 miles from the banks of the Tkukoma. Spread out before you now is the Vale of Nahba, a spectacularly strange region of the Chai Plain that is punctuated with hundreds of bore holes and geysers. Great columns of steam and scalding water are hurled skywards, driven by the pressure of gases escaping from deep below the surface. Some fissures descend for miles and pass close to the planet<ch.apos/>s molten core.</p>
       <p>The highway traverses this alien landscape and, as darkness approaches, you find yourself at a place near the eastern rim of the vale. A night camp is established here among the bubbling pools and hollows, and an evening meal of poached eggs and steamed fish is prepared. After supper, you settle down and try to get some sleep, despite the constant distraction of the noises that echo eerily across this strange valley.</p>

       <p>Kumal is disappointed that you refuse to trade with him, and he walks off in a huff. Fearing you may have insulted the brother of your host, you decide to leave the tent and give Kumal time to cool down. Once outside, you check the caravan to make sure that everything is correct. The carriages and the horses are in good condition, and so you wander out of the encampment to explore this quarter of Rakholi.</p>

       <p>The dusty streets of Pensei are filled with the din of coarse shouting, the smells of sweat and spices, and the anxious murmurings of a populace living in fear of the Bhanarian invaders. Your heart goes out to the citizens of this proud city and you pray to Ishir to help them keep the enemy at bay. Upon arriving at the great north gate of Pensei, the column passes beneath its crenellated arch and out onto the plains road beyond. As the gate crashes shut behind you, you notice a stone marker by the wayside. It indicates the distance to the next town: Javai<ch.emdash/>100 miles.</p>
       <p>Captain Chan calculates that it may take nearly three days to reach Javai. Fearful that the vanguard of the Autarch<ch.apos/>s army may find the caravan on the open road and threaten its precious cargo, he orders his troopers to take up positions around the column in order to shield it. You are impressed by the speed and efficiency with which they carry out his orders, and you feel greatly reassured that you are in the company of highly-trained warriors. They will be useful allies if the need should ever arise to repel an enemy attack.</p>
       <p>Once you are beyond the outskirts of Pensei, the villages pass by with less frequency the further you travel north along this broad trade road. At dusk, you stop to set up a night camp on a hill which overlooks a small hamlet called Xiostai. Captain Chan posts pickets to patrol the camp perimeter, and details some of the remaining men to guard the Khea-khan<ch.apos/>s carriage. You are invited to share a meal of rice and fish with Chan and some of the carriage drivers, and you accept their hospitality gladly. While you are eating you listen to their jovial conversations and learn something about the Chai people that you never knew before. The majority of them have a keen interest in astrology.</p>

A wagon is parked outside its dilapidated gate, and when you magnify your vision, you are shocked to see the faded tiger<ch.apos/>s-head emblem of Bhanar emblazoned upon its sun-bleached timbers.

       <p>You chance a glance around the pillar and your stomach churns when you see the awe-inspiring figure of Autarch Sejanoz standing at the far end of this ancient crypt chamber.</p>
       <p>Encased from neck to toe in black armour, inlaid with lavish gold filigree, he stands a sword<ch.apos/>s length taller than you. His great tiger helm conceals his face, and swirling around him are the folds of a voluminous scarlet cloak. Only his hands are visible and they seem incongruous when compared to the grand scale and design of his armour. They are like twisted claws, the skin wrinkled and fragile like ancient parchment. Hanging over them are four long, curved, needle-like claws of steel which sprout from the back of the golden bracers that encase his wrists.</p>
       <p>Cowering in a corner of the crypt are the Imperial Family, their eyes wide with naked terror. One of the Autarch<ch.apos/>s Imperial Guard Captains stands over them with a glowing stave held firmly in his gauntleted hands. The tip of the stave trails wisps of blue-grey smoke, indicating that it is this weapon, and its wielder, who were responsible for the death of Sergeant Yeng.</p>
       <p>The Autarch calls for you to surrender. <quote>Resistance is futile, mortal. My troops are everywhere.</quote> You are about to give voice to a defiant reply when a sudden pain lances through your head.</p>

The golden ornamentation that once embellished these carriages has been stripped away, and their fine lacquered sides have been painted a dun brown to camouflage their true origins.

You mount your horse, and then together you watch in silence as the aged Khea-khan and his family arrive in the courtyard. Devoted attendants usher them into the middle carriage, and as soon as the doors are closed, Chan gives the signal for the column to move off. Slowly the carriages trundle through the gates of the palace and out into the city beyond, preceded by the Imperial Cavalry troopers. You and Chan follow behind the third carriage, and as you are passing through the gates, the last sound you hear is the collective sobbing of the Khea-khan<ch.apos/>s loyal servants, those he has had to leave behind.</p>

       <p>You sleep well and rise shortly before dawn to help prepare the horses for the road ahead. A mount is assigned to the prisoner, and he rides with you and Captain Chan at the head of the caravan column. The highway skirts the perimeter of the Javai Forest, and within an hour of leaving the ford, you catch sight of something in the distance that makes your senses tingle. To your right you see a wooded rise that runs parallel to the highway. You question the prisoner and he confirms that this is where his brother Kronar has prepared the ambush.</p>
       <p>Chan orders the caravan drivers to halt and await his further signal, and then together the three of you ride ahead. Xango<ch.apos/>s hands are tied behind his back and a noose is slipped over his head. This is attached to a trailing rope which is fastened to the horn of the captain<ch.apos/>s saddle. If Xango should attempt to escape, he will either strangle himself or break his neck when the rope is pulled taut.</p>
       <p>Suddenly you see two riders appear on the crest of the rise. They dismount and then disappear among the folds of the woodland. Minutes later they reappear atop a hillock, now no more than 30 yards distant. Instantly Chan recognizes that one of them, a tall man dressed in a padded tunic of scarlet and black silk, is Captain Kronar. You watch with growing trepidation as Kronar unslings a bow from his shoulder, draws an arrow, and takes aim in your direction. Moments later his companion copies his leader<ch.apos/>s actions.</p>

       <p>The mood among the troopers and entourage is subdued after the harrowing events that befell you in the Vale of Nahba. It is not until you reach the River Tkukoma, and see the famous Vulkin Bridge that spans this mighty waterway, that their spirits begin to rise. Chan informs you that the bridge was named after an ancient Khea-khan of Chai, one of Xo-lin<ch.apos/>s illustrious ancestors. The caravan halts on the bridge and the Khea-khan makes a rare appearance. Briefly, he leaves the confines of his carriage to pay tribute at a shrine dedicated to his famous ancestor.</p>
       <p>Beyond the bridge lies the realm of Lissan. You enter this friendly territory and late in the afternoon you see riders approaching on the highway ahead. They are mounted on sturdy black ponies and they bear the scarlet wolf<ch.apos/>s head flag of Bazan<ch.emdash/>a famous Lissanian nomad chief. Their leader greets you warmly and he warns Captain Chan that Bhanarian scouts have been sighted in this region. He and his men volunteer to escort the caravan to Rakholi, and Captain Chan gratefully accepts their offer.</p>

       <p>Silently you approach the bandits and circle around behind their position without being detected. You are drawing your Kai Weapon when a crow, sitting upon a branch directly above you, suddenly takes to the air. The sound of its cawing and the flapping of its wings startle the bandits, and they glimpse you as they turn around. Quickly you raise your weapon and leap into their hide. You land the first blow, striking one bandit a glancing hit upon his leather-capped head. It gashes his scalp and sends him crashing unconscious to the soft earth. His comrade snatches up his axe and retaliates by taking a clumsy swipe at your head. You dodge this blow easily, and then you press home your attack.</p>

You grab your equipment and hurry up the steps to the battlements and stare out across the southern plain. In the distance you see a large enemy force of cavalry and infantry, manoeuvring in readiness for an assault upon the fort. You are joined by Captain Chan. He casts his seasoned eyes across the grim spectacle and issues an order to Sergeant Yeng to make sure that the Khea-khan and his entourage are below ground. Once they are all safely in the catacombs, Yeng is to secure the portal and report back. Chan summons all of his troopers to the battlements to reinforce Kasarian<ch.apos/>s depleted garrison. <quote>We will be hard-pressed to repel this attack,</quote> he confides.</p>

As soon as you see that the enemy have obeyed your command signal, you look out across the plain towards the west. A smile spreads slowly across your face when you see Captain Chan is leading the caravan at speed towards Fort Vlau. Hurriedly you descend the flag-tower and join Yeng and his troopers. You leap into the saddle of a Bhanarian steed and dig in your heels, sending the mount lurching forwards.

       <p>After bowing respectfully to the Khea-khan, Chan strides out of the throne room and disappears along the corridor beyond. Nearby, a group of silk-robed courtiers are gathering up hundreds of Chai court scrolls and other papers of state. You volunteer to help them place these valuable manuscripts into wickerwork baskets, and then carry them outside to the Imperial Caravan in readiness for the long journey east.</p>
       <p>The caravan consists of three large carriages, each drawn by a team of eight horses, plus an escort of twenty Imperial Cavalry troopers clad in plain crimson tunics. The golden ornamentation that once embellished the state carriages has been stripped away, and their fine lacquered sides have been painted a dun brown to camouflage their true origins. You approve of their ordinary appearance for it will be far less likely to attract unwanted attention on the long road ahead.</p>
       <p>You are helping to load the baskets of papers into the last of the carriages when Captain Chan arrives, fresh from his visit to the armoury. You notice that he is now wearing a waistcoat of golden mail, called an <foreign xml:lang="x-chaian">ang<ch.apos/>sei</foreign>, and he is carrying a halberd-like spear called a <foreign xml:lang="x-chaian">kirusami</foreign>. With a deft flick of this fine weapon he motions to a stable guard to bring him his horse<ch.emdash/>a proud stable stallion. The young guardsman also brings an additional mount, a dappled chestnut mare, and he hands the reins of this horse to you.</p>
       <p><quote>We<ch.apos/>ll ride together, my lord,</quote> says Chan, as he settles himself into the saddle. You mount your horse, and then together you watch in silence as the aged Khea-khan and his family arrive in the courtyard. Devoted attendants usher them into the middle carriage, and as soon as the doors are closed, Chan gives the signal for the column to move off. Slowly the carriages trundle through the gates of the Imperial Palace and out into the city beyond. You and Chan follow behind the third carriage, and as you ride through the gates, the last sound you hear is the gentle sobbing of the Khea-khan<ch.apos/>s palace servants, those he has had to leave behind.</p>

       <p>East of Javai, the highway passes through several small settlements where Chai farmers toil contentedly under the hot midsummer sun.

       <p>During this time, you scan the southern horizon, ever watchful for signs of enemy scouts. There is little to see out there on the grassy plain, but your eye is drawn to a mound of stones that rest atop a nearby hillock. When you magnify your vision, you recognize that this mound of sun-bleached stones is a <foreign xml:lang="x-chaian">yansi</foreign><ch.emdash/>an ancient Chai burial cairn.</p>

       <p>You ascend to the top of the platform and peer over the parapet to see Sergeant Yeng and the others emerging from the command tent. Their attack has been successful. While he and his men gather up enemy horses so that you can make a speedy escape, you pick up the signalman<ch.apos/>s flags and issue an urgent order to the attacking troops to withdraw immediately. As soon as you see that the enemy have obeyed your command signal, you look out across the plain towards the west. A smile spreads across your face when you see Captain Chan is leading the caravan at speed towards Fort Vlau.</p>
       <p>Hurriedly you descend the flag-tower and join Yeng and his troopers. You leap into the saddle of a Bhanarian steed and dig in your heels, sending the mount lurching forwards. With the warm summer wind blowing in your faces, you and your brave comrades gallop across the plain to rendezvous with the caravan at Fort Vlau.</p>

       <p>As you settle down to sleep beneath one of the carriages, you are thankful that you will not have to stand watch during the night. You sleep well and wake at dawn to the delicious smell of freshly-brewed jala. After a hearty breakfast with Chan and his troopers, you mount up and ride with the captain at the head of the caravan column. Shortly before noon, you spot a village in the distance and a cloud of dust approaching on the road ahead. It is being kicked up by a horse, ridden by a man sent ahead by Chan over an hour ago to scout the village and its surrounding crop fields.</p>
       <p>The trooper reports that the village ahead has been attacked by bandits during the night. <quote>Kronar, I suppose?</quote> enquires Chan, and the scout confirms his captain<ch.apos/>s assumption with a nod of his head. <quote>I thought so. That cur. One day he<ch.apos/>ll be made to pay with his life, mark my words.</quote></p>
       <p>Chan informs you that this region is blighted by the presence of a bandit gang, led by a renegade Chai army captain called Kronar. He has a fearsome reputation for being an outstanding archer and a ruthless murderer.</p>
       <p>His gang has a secret base located somewhere deep inside the Javai Forest. From there they launch attacks upon helpless travellers using the trade road, and undertake raids upon isolated farmsteads out on the Great Plain. Many attempts have been made to bring Kronar and his gang to justice, but all have so far failed.</p>
       <p>Chan estimates that the caravan will reach the Javai Forest around sunset. He is fearful that Kronar<ch.apos/>s bandits may attempt an ambush, believing that the caravan belongs to a Penseian merchant who is rich enough to afford a military escort. Chan summons his flankers and then he orders them to ride ahead to scout the highway where it borders upon the forest. If Kronar intends to launch a surprise attack on the caravan, this is where he is most likely to set up his ambush.</p>
       <p>As the scouts prepare to leave, Chan offers you the chance to go with them or remain with the caravan column.</p>

Hurriedly you spin around on your heel and find yourself confronted by two hulking creatures that have emerged from the trees. Although hunched over, you can tell that they are both several yards tall. They have muscular truncated legs that end in fearsomely twisted claws, and their bony orange heads have slitted eyes that pulse unnervingly. From between their alien eyes protrudes a beak-like nose, jagged-edged and wickedly sharp.</p>
       <p>With a hideous shriek the creatures are upon you, slashing and stabbing with their terrible claws and beaks. Desperately, you and Chan struggle to unsheathe your weapons as you are forced back in the face of their fearsome onslaught.</p>

       <p>You twist away and save yourself from being impaled by the warrior<ch.apos/>s deadly stave. Its tip bites into the stone floor and discharges a powerful bolt of electricity, jolting the weapon out of his hands. The Guard Captain curses you as he staggers backwards with traceries of electrical fire dancing around his forearms. Upon the instant that this power dissipates, he reaches for his trusty battle-axe that is hanging by a loop from his gem-encrusted belt.</p>

       <p>Night is drawing its veil across the sky when you enter the great tented city of Rakholi. This vast nomadic settlement nestles upon a rich flood plain which supplies excellent feed for the horses of this region. Horses are a way of life for the nomads, and Rakholi is where they come to conduct their business.</p>
       <p>Your Lissanian escorts deliver you into the tented encampment of their leader, the illustrious Gavhan Bazan. The Khea-khan and his family remain aboard their carriages while you and Captain Chan make sure that a safe and friendly reception awaits them. Inside the main tent you discover a wondrous sight. The nomad chief sits atop a nest of cushions surrounded by jugglers, acrobats, capering dwarves, and a host of exotic dancing girls. Pots of incense smoke before him, and there are platters of food and fine wine in abundance.</p>
       <p>The bearded Bazan greets you with a flamboyant gesture of his arms, and he enquires hurriedly as to the nature of your cargo. He is eager to trade. Chan<ch.apos/>s reply is evasive, and you sense that he does not entirely trust the nomad chief. The captain looks to you and whispers under his breath: <quote>Can you tell if this man is worthy of our trust, Grand Master?</quote></p>

He was born in Bhanar but was forced to leave when he attempted to organize opposition to Autarch Sejanoz in his home city of Yua Tzhan. He became a hermit and eked out a solitary existence here in the ruins of Zanaza. His life was lonely but peaceful, until the tomb robbers arrived one day and took over his underground retreat. The vile smell that he exuded earlier was the only way he had of keeping those cut-throats at bay.</p>

You tell him that you happened upon the robbers by chance last night, and merely asked the good fellows to return it. Chan laughs when he hears this. <quote>Well, we<ch.apos/>ll not be seeing any more from those fine fellows again, I dare say,</quote> he says, and a wry smile spreads across his wide face.</p>
       <p>The caravan leaves Zanaza within the hour, and as it follows the stony road east towards Fort Vlau, you note a battered signpost which states that the Lissanian stronghold lies 150 miles away. Chan estimates the journey will take four days.</p>
       <p>The first day of the journey passes uneventfully, but around noon of the second you see the highway approaching a distant forest. Your Sixth Sense gives you a premonition of danger, and when you tell Chan of your concerns, he halts the caravan and insists that the two of you scout the forest to make sure it is safe to pass through.</p>

He is asleep on a silken divan and is being watched over by his tutor Shavane, who is reading a book.

       <p>By using the bough as a support for the carriage axle, repair of the damaged wheel rim is effected speedily. Chan praises your practical skills, and within the hour the caravan column is moving eastwards once more. An overnight camp is pitched on the highway itself, near a sleepy hamlet called Sansei, and the following day you make good progress on the sun-baked highway.</p>
       <p>Shortly before noon of the third day of your journey to Rakholi, the caravan column crests the rim of a wide valley that lies 50 miles from the banks of the Tkukoma. Spread out before you now is the Vale of Nahba, a spectacularly strange region of the Chai Plain that is punctuated with hundreds of bore holes and geysers. Great columns of steam and scalding water are hurled skywards, driven by the pressure of gases escaping from deep below the surface. Some of the fissures descend for miles, passing close to the planet<ch.apos/>s molten core.</p>
       <p>The highway traverses this alien landscape and, as darkness approaches, you find yourself at a place near the eastern rim of the vale. A night camp is established here among the bubbling pools and hollows, and an evening meal of poached eggs and steamed fish is prepared. After supper, you settle down and try to get some sleep, despite the constant distraction of the eerie noises that echo across this strange valley.</p>

       <p>Bazan and all of his servants turn out to bid the caravan farewell. As parting gifts, he presents the Khea-khan with a pair of magnificent horses, both prime Lissanian stallions. He also pledges to do everything in his power to delay the enemy until the caravan reaches Tazhan, and he vows to join with the New Kingdom armies upon the Khea-khan<ch.apos/>s return to Chai. Kau-Doshin conveys to him Xo-lin<ch.apos/>s thanks, and then you set off on the three-day journey to the ruined city of Zanaza.</p>

The brave Princess obeys your command. As she helps her father to reach the far end of the burial crypt, you run through the poison cloud and set off in determined pursuit of the tyrant and his young hostage.</p>

       <p>Chan details two other men to accompany you, and then he places Sergeant Yeng in charge of the caravan<ch.apos/>s escort while you are away scouting the copse. The captain gives the order to move out, and all three of you follow as he turns his stallion about and canters through the tall grasses towards the distant pines. As you approach them, he informs you that it is very unusual for plains ravens to gather in such numbers. Your Kai Sixth Sense tingles, confirming that his suspicions are well founded.</p>
       <p>As you draw closer, he signals to his men to split up and circle around the copse in opposing directions. They carry out his command as you and the captain bring your horses to a halt and dismount. From here you cover the final 100 yards to the copse on foot, your stealthy approach concealed by the tall grasses. You have penetrated 20 yards into the parched woods when suddenly you happen upon a shocking scene.</p>

       <p>From out of the tall grasses come loping three long-limbed monstrosities with scaly green hides and dripping fangs. The leading creature leaps through the air like a pouncing cheetah and tears the nearest trooper from his saddle. As he falls, you hear Sergeant Yeng scream an urgent call to arms.</p>

       <p>Upon returning to the gate, you press your eye to the observation slit and see the steam-cannon standing less than 50 yards distant. To your surprise, you see that the great barrel of the gun is pointing directly at the ground. The Bhanarian artillerymen are firing explosive projectiles deep into the earth. Repeatedly they reload and fire into the ground until a large crater is formed by their shells. With the firing of the tenth shell you see a large mass of timber and shattered rock ejected from the crater, and your throat tightens with dread when you suddenly fathom the reason why they are firing their siege gun in this manner.</p>

       <p>The threat to the caravan ends abruptly when you deal the last monster a mighty blow to the base of its deformed head. As it falls from the carriage, you grab the reins and bring the wagon smoothly to a halt. Captain Chan tries to calm the alarmed members of the Khea-khan<ch.apos/>s entourage by telling them that the threat has now passed. As their panic subsides, he and his men report to the Khea-khan<ch.apos/>s carriage and tell Kau-Doshin that order has been restored. He is greatly reassured to hear that his Imperial Majesty is no longer in any immediate danger.</p>
       <p>You walk back cautiously along the highway and inspect the bodies of the slain enemy. You are quickly able to determine that all three are of Agarashi descent. They have probably come down from the Hyunsei foothills in a desperate search for prey, for their corpses are badly emaciated by hunger. Sergeant Yeng rides up and confirms your belief. He tells you that long ago, during the Age of Eternal Night, this land was stalked by Agarashi<ch.emdash/>the hellish creations of Agarash the Damned. When Agarash was destroyed by the Elder Magi, his creations were scattered across the wilderness and plains of Chai. The descendants of these beasts are still alive today, hiding in hills, burrows, forests, and caves.</p>
       <p><quote>They do not usually attack travellers,</quote> says Chan, <quote>unless driven to do so by disease<ch.ellips/>or hunger.</quote></p>
       <p>Using your tracking skills, you quickly determine that there are no other Agarashi like these in this vicinity. Only then do you remount your horse and ride with Chan to the head of the column. As you pass by the Khea-khan<ch.apos/>s carriage, Kau-Doshin calls you to halt. With a respectful bow of his greying head, he praises you for the skill and bravery you displayed while countering the unexpected attack.</p>

They have muscular truncated legs that end in fearsomely twisted claws, and their bony orange heads have slitted eyes that pulse unnervingly. From between their alien eyes protrude beak-like noses, jagged-edged and wickedly sharp, with which they are attempting to stab and slash the Chai guardsmen.</p>

       <p>You lift the canvas cover and peer into the back of the wagon. It contains an assortment of shovels, picks, and a few battered oil lanterns. They appear to belong to a gang of tomb robbers who have come here to loot this ancient burial site.</p>
       <p>Beyond the gate you can see an open crypt door. As you approach it you hear the sound of distant voices. This sound makes you dive for cover among the gravestones. As you peer around one of these grey headstones, you see six saddled horses standing at the rear of the crypt. They are nibbling at the pale tufts of grass that grow on the graves.</p>

       <p>The fight ends abruptly when you deal the last living creature a mighty blow to the base of its deformed head. As it falls lifelessly to the ground, Sergeant Yeng rushes to check that his men have survived intact. Cautiously you inspect the bodies of the slain enemy and quickly determine that they are of Agarashi descent. They have probably come down from the Hyunsei foothills in a desperate search for prey, for all three corpses are emaciated by hunger. Sergeant Yeng confirms your suspicions. He tells you that long ago, during the Age of Eternal Night, this land was stalked by Agarashi<ch.emdash/>the hellish creations of Agarash the Damned. When Agarash was destroyed by the Elder Magi, his creations were scattered across the wilderness and plains of Chai. The descendants of these beasts are still alive today, hiding in hills, burrows, and caves. They do not usually attack travellers unless driven by disease or famine.</p>
       <p>Using your tracking skills, you quickly determine that there are no other creatures like these in this vicinity. Only then do you and the troopers remount your horses and continue along the highway towards the Javai Forest. A few miles short of the forest you discover a freshwater spring which is forded by the highway. It is an ideal site for a night camp, and so you send one of Yeng<ch.apos/>s men back to the caravan to tell them you shall await their arrival here.</p>
       <p>During your wait for the caravan, unless you possess the Discipline of Grand Huntmastery, you must now eat a Meal or lose 3 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points.</p>

       <p>The scream ends abruptly and you think no more about it until you see two troopers running towards the Princess<ch.apos/>s carriage. You sense that something is seriously amiss, and you decide that perhaps it would be best if you investigated further.</p>
       <p>On reaching the carriage, you discover Princess Mitzu consoling her young son who is shivering with fright. Chan is nearby, holding a dead serpent by the tail. You swallow hard when you see that it is a scarlet viper, a notoriously poisonous snake. One of Chan<ch.apos/>s troopers is being restrained by two of his comrades, and he is pleading his innocence.</p>
       <p><quote>What is going on?</quote> you ask.</p>
       <p>Chan explains that the Prince disturbed the viper which was asleep under the covers of his cot.</p>
       <p><quote>He is lucky to be alive,</quote> says Mitzu, hugging him close. <quote>His cries alerted Captain Chan and me, and when we arrived, we found Trooper Yankin inside the carriage. I suspect he is an enemy agent, one of the Autarch<ch.apos/>s spies.</quote></p>

The way is now open for the caravan to reach Tazhan unhindered, and upon your arrival there, you discover that the news of Autarch Sejanoz<ch.apos/>s demise has already spread the length and breadth of Southern Magnamund. The Khea-khan is able to rally the New Kingdom armies and sweep the shattered remnants of the Bhanarian armies back into their own lands and beyond.</p>
       <p>Congratulations, Grand Master. Your victory is total. You have rid this continent and its people of a cruel tyrant who has threatened their peaceful existence for many centuries, and your triumph here is set to become legend. In future times the chronicle will tell of other quests that you undertook on the road to becoming a Kai Supreme Master. Until the time comes for their telling, may the Gods Ishir and Kai watch over you, always.</p>
