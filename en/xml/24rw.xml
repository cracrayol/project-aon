     <p>You are a Grand Master of the New Order of the Kai<ch.emdash/>the warrior <ch.eacute/>lite of Sommerlund.</p>

     <p>It is the year MS<ch.nbsp/>5083, thirty-three years after the First Order of the Kai was almost wiped out by the Darklords of Helgedad. These champions of evil, who were sent by the Dark God Naar to destroy your fertile world of Magnamund, have since been destroyed. Lone Wolf, the leader of your illustrious fighting order, was the sole survivor of the massacre. As a young Kai initiate he stood amidst the burning wreckage of the old Kai Monastery and vowed to avenge the slaughter of his comrades. In the year MS<ch.nbsp/>5070 he kept his pledge when alone he infiltrated the foul domain of the Darklords and destroyed the infernal city of Helgedad, the base of their evil power.</p>

     <p>With the fall of Helgedad, chaos befell the Darkland armies who had, until then, been poised to conquer all Magnamund. Quickly their disorder escalated into a mutinous civil war which allowed the Freeland Alliance armies of Magnamund time in which to recover and launch a successful counter-offensive. Against all odds, a swift and total victory was secured over the feuding armies of evil.</p>

     <p>Following the demise of the Darklords, peace reigned in your homeland of Sommerlund. Under the direction of Lone Wolf the ruined Monastery of the Kai was rebuilt and restored to its former glory, and the raising of a New Order of Kai warriors was swiftly established. You are one of this new generation of Kai recruits. You were born in Sommerlund in the year MS<ch.nbsp/>5063, during the time of the war against the Darklords. When you were seven years old you were sent by your father to the Kai Monastery. There, under the tutelage of Lone Wolf, you developed your martial skills and honed the special Kai abilities which lay dormant within you. During the years that followed, your skills were nurtured and sharpened to perfection by long hours of study and rigorous training. Your exceptional talent helped you master all of the Kai and Magnakai Disciplines, and you rose swiftly through the ranks of the New Order to become one of only five who now hold the high rank of Kai Grand Master. It is an achievement which has brought great honour upon you and your family.</p>

     <p>In the year MS<ch.nbsp/>5077 your skill and courage were put to the test when an attack was launched upon the Kai Monastery during Lone Wolf<ch.apos/>s absence. By means of a Shadow Gate (an astral corridor between the physical world of Magnamund and the many ethereal domains which lie beyond it), Naar sent forth a host of dragon-creatures to besiege the monastery and lay waste to all Sommerlund. He had chosen his time well, yet his evil plan was thwarted by the tenacious defence that you and your brethren maintained until the siege was raised by Lone Wolf and the King<ch.apos/>s Army of Sommerlund.</p>

     <p>During the six years that have elapsed since the defeat of his minions, Naar has endeavoured to enact his vengeance upon the Kai. He commands many agents of evil upon Magnamund, and quietly they wait in the shadows for the day when they can serve their fell master. One such agent was Baron Sadanzo of Siyen. The Kingdom of Siyen is one of the richest countries in the continent of Southern Magnamund, and it is also one of Sommerlund<ch.apos/>s oldest allies. Sadanzo had its ruler, King Oridon, brutally assassinated so that he could lay claim to the throne in the absence of Prince Karvas, Oridon<ch.apos/>s only son, who lived in exile upon the remote Isle of Sheasu. The Baron was a disciple of Naar and he possessed a sorcerous power that had turned the minds of the Siyenese Court to his will. By use of sorcery he made them support his ascendance to the throne. It was a dangerous threat to Siyen, yet all was not lost. The constitution of Siyen decreed that Prince Karvas had, upon the death of his father, 60 days in which to lay claim to his rightful heritage. Only if he failed to return in time would Sadanzo be elected the new King.</p>

     <p>Lone Wolf promised to prevent Baron Sadanzo from usurping the throne, but it was a pledge that only you could fulfil. At the time of King Oridon<ch.apos/>s assassination, you were engaged upon a mission in Southern Magnamund and were closer to the Isle of Sheasu than any other Kai. Upon successful completion of your mission, Lone Wolf ordered you to forgo your return to the Kai Monastery and journey instead to Sheasu to seek out the exiled Prince. Your new mission was to find Karvas and escort him safely home in time to claim his throne and thwart Sadanzo<ch.apos/>s plan. Despite great adversity you succeeded; Prince Karvas was duly elected King and the evil Baron Sadanzo and his followers were put to the sword. In recognition of your courage and your invaluable help in saving his realm from Sadanzo<ch.apos/>s tyranny, the newly-crowned King Karvas made you an honourable Knight of Siyen. He also placed <cite>Golden Star</cite>, his royal sailing ship, at your disposal to help speed your return home to Holmgard<ch.emdash/>the Sommlending capital.</p>

     <p>Shortly after dawn on a cool mid-autumn morning, the sleek royal Siyenese clipper glided into Holmgard harbour. Despite the early hour, an escort of the King<ch.apos/>s Guard were standing by in readiness to convey you by carriage directly to the Kai Monastery where you were greeted and warmly congratulated by your fellow Grand Masters. You also received glowing praise from Supreme Master Lone Wolf for successfully completing your missions and for upholding the finest traditions of the Kai. It felt good to be home after so many months abroad and you were looking forward to settling back into the routine of the monastery. But your hopes were soon dashed when, later that day, you were summoned by Lone Wolf to a private audience with him in his chambers. The news he had to impart came as an unexpected shock.</p>

     <p><quote>We must prepare for a crusade, Grand Master,</quote> he said, as he unfurled a large vellum <a idref="map">map of central Magnamund</a> and spread it upon the granite floor of his vaulted chamber. <quote>War rages anew in the Stornlands, and its ravenous flames threaten to devour our allies within the Freeland Alliance.</quote></p>

     <p>Lone Wolf unsheathed his mighty sword<ch.emdash/>Sommerswerd<ch.emdash/>and, using the tip of its golden blade, he pointed to a landlocked realm west of the great River Storn. <quote>This is Eldenora, the source of the problems we must face. Since the fall of its former ruler, Prince Lutha, a new lordling has arisen to snatch the reins of this lawless realm. He is not of noble birth, yet he has crushed all royal opposition and taken upon himself the title Lord Vandyan of Eldenora. Earlier this year he swelled the ranks of his army with regiments of Magadorian and Ogian mercenaries. After having falsely accused his peaceful neighbour<ch.emdash/>Delden<ch.emdash/>of violating Eldenoran territory, he stationed these mercenaries along his northern border. When Delden mustered its army to counter the threat, Vandyan accused them of aggression and promptly declared war. The campaign was swift and brutal; Delden<ch.apos/>s army was broken in battle and its people are now enslaved by this tyrant. Emboldened by his martial success, Vandyan carried the war further afield. Magador, its defences already weakened by the defection to Eldenora of its best mercenary regiments, was the next to crumble. By mid-summer Vandyan<ch.apos/>s army had crossed the River Storn and captured Salony. Word reached us from neighbouring Lyris that a steady stream of fresh troops were arriving from Eldenora to bolster the ranks of its occupying armies. Clearly Lyris, with its ancient city of Varetta, was the next jewel to be added to Vandyan<ch.apos/>s shameful crown of conquest.</quote></p>

     <p>Lone Wolf interrupted the briefing to open a door to an adjoining antechamber, and through this doorway shuffled an old man clad in a hooded robe of dyed brown linen. <quote>May I introduce you to Gwynian the Sage,</quote> said Lone Wolf, reverently. <quote>He has travelled from Varetta to seek our aid.</quote></p>

     <p>The name Gwynian was well known to you, for this wise sage had helped Lone Wolf on many occasions in the past and his name was revered by the Kai. But this was the first time you had met him in person and you felt greatly honoured. In turn, Gwynian praised you for the victories you had achieved since becoming a Kai Grand Master. Upon Lone Wolf<ch.apos/>s invitation, he approached the map and took over the briefing.</p>

     <p><quote>Since my arrival here, sadly I have learned that my beloved city of Varetta is besieged by Vandyan<ch.apos/>s horde,</quote> he said, with quiet solemnity. <quote>Lone Wolf has already told you that the Eldenorans are receiving a constant supply of reinforcements. This fact alone would be of grave concern, but it is the nature of these troops that disturbs us more. They are neither human nor mercenaries. They are Vorka, a fighting breed of Agarashi that became extinct following the destruction of their master<ch.emdash/>Agarash the Damned<ch.emdash/>several millennia ago<ch.ellips/>or so we had believed. Now the Vorka have reappeared in great numbers. They are armed, trained, and utterly subservient to the commands of Lord Vandyan.</quote></p>

     <p>As Gwynian continued the briefing, you learned that the war had escalated greatly since the arrival of the Vorka. To the south, Eldenoran armies had seized the city of Tekaro and were marching across the Slovarian Plain, driving the battle-weary Slovians before them. To the west, Vandyan<ch.apos/>s armies had invaded Palmyrion and were within reach of Vanamor, the capital. Lone Wolf informed you that Guildmaster Banedon had travelled to Palmyrion by skyship to assist its ruler, Elector Manatine, muster his country<ch.apos/>s defences. With his help the Palmyrions were holding the enemy at bay, but with hundreds of Vorka reinforcements arriving unchecked, it was simply a matter of time before Vanamor would be overrun.</p>

     <p><quote>The Vorka are the key to Vandyan<ch.apos/>s military successes,</quote> said Lone Wolf. <quote>If we are to defeat him and save our allies, then we must cut off his reinforcements at the source.</quote></p>

     <p><quote>This is so,</quote> replied Gwynian, <quote>and we do know from where the Vorka have sprung.</quote> The sage stooped and pointed with a gnarled finger at the middle of the vellum map. <quote>Our agents have reported they come from here<ch.ellips/>Duadon. It is the Eldenoran capital. Thousands of Vorka have been observed marching out from this walled city to bolster Vandyan<ch.apos/>s armies in the field, yet no Vorka have ever been seen entering the city from elsewhere. This can mean but one thing: the Vorka horde is being created somewhere within Duadon itself.</quote></p>

     <p><quote>But how?</quote> you asked, incredulously. <quote>Is Vandyan a great sorcerer?</quote></p>

     <p><quote>No, he is not a sorcerer, great or otherwise,</quote> replied Gwynian, knowingly. <quote>But he has discovered an ancient force that was thought to be lost forever. There is only one power in Magnamund capable of creating the Vorka: the power of the runes. Vandyan has discovered the lost Runes of Agarash the Damned.</quote></p>

     <p>Gwynian told of how, millennia ago, Agarash the Damned had battled with the Elder Magi in a war that had lasted for more than a thousand years. Nearing the end of this epic confrontation, as his vitality waned against the goodly magic of the Elder Magi, the evil Agarash encapsulated the essence of his remaining powers into tablets of obsidian and crystals of jet. Agarash knew that he was doomed, but if he were able to preserve some of his powers in this way, so that they could be used by future disciples of Naar upon Magnamund, then the legacy of his terrible rule would survive beyond him. Three obsidian tablets were engraved with marks, or runes, to distinguish their fell origin, while a further seven crystals were fashioned into likenesses of the Kai Lorestones and called Doomstones in mockery of those goodly gems of power.</p>

     <p><quote>Since the demise of Agarash, some of the Doomstones have surfaced to ensnare and empower Naar<ch.apos/>s lowly agents,</quote> said Gwynian. <quote>But the Doomstones cannot create Vorka. Only the runes hold this power. It has long been believed that they perished with Agarash himself in the destruction of Naaros, his legendary stronghold. Now, it seems, they have finally surfaced once more<ch.ellips/>and have fallen into the hands of Lord Vandyan.</quote></p>

     <p>Lone Wolf vowed that he would help Gwynian raise the siege of Varetta and secure for him the freedom of Lyris. The New Order Kai were told to prepare for a crusade against Eldenora, and valuable help was provided by High-Mayor Kordas of Casiorn. At his own expense, this rich merchant ruler raised an army of mercenaries in Anari, Firalond, and Kakush, and he sent them to the town of Quarlen to prevent the enemy from crossing the River Quarl. These mercenaries are skilled soldiers and have been paid handsomely, but they lack gifted leaders. It was agreed that the Kai would provide this leadership, with Kai Grand Masters and lesser ranks assuming command of mercenary regiments upon their arrival in Quarlen.</p>

     <p><quote>Three days hence, we begin the ride to Quarlen,</quote> said Lone Wolf. <quote>Armed with our knowledge, our courage, and our Disciplines, I vow we Kai shall turn back the tide of evil that now threatens to consume our allies.</quote></p>

      <p>If you have completed any previous <cite>Lone Wolf New Order</cite> adventures, remember to choose an additional Grand Master Discipline and add <ch.plus/>1 to your basic <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> and <ch.plus/>2 to your basic <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> for each adventure you successfully completed (cf. <a idref="discplnz">Grand Master Disciplines</a>).</p>

    <data>
     <p>You keep a record of your adventure on the <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
     <p>During the years you have spent in training at the Kai Monastery, you have devoted yourself to further developing your fighting prowess (<typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ>) and physical stamina (<typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ>). Before you begin this <cite>New Order</cite> adventure you need to measure how effective your training has been. To do this take a pencil and, with your eyes closed, point the blunt end of it onto the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a>. If you pick a 0 it counts as zero.</p>
     <p>The first number that you pick from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> in this way represents your <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ>. Add 25 to the number you picked and write the total in the <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> section of your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a> (i.e. if your pencil fell on the number 7 in the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> you would write in a <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> of 32). When you fight, your <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> will be pitted against that of your enemy. A high score in this section is therefore desirable.</p>
     <p>The second number that you pick from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> represents your powers of <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ>. Add 30 to this number and write the total in the <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> section of your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a> (i.e. if your pencil fell on the number 8 on the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> you would have 38 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points).</p>
     <p>If you are wounded in combat you will lose <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points. If at any time your <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points fall to zero or below, you are dead and the adventure is over. Lost <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points can be regained during the course of the adventure, but your number of <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points cannot rise above the number you have when you start an adventure.</p>
     <p>If you have successfully completed previous adventures in the <cite>Lone Wolf New Order</cite> series (Books 21<ch.endash/>23), you can carry your current scores of <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> and <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points over to this adventure.<footref id="gamerulz-1" idref="gamerulz-1-foot"/> You may also carry over any Special Items, Kai Weapon, normal Weapons, and Backpack Items you had in your possession at the end of your last adventure, and these should be entered on your new <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
     <p><strong>Playing Tip:</strong> You may use a 10-sided die instead of the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> if you find it more convenient.</p>

       <p>It has long been the tradition of your <ch.eacute/>lite warrior caste to bestow a new name upon each young novice when they complete their first year<ch.apos/>s training at the Kai Monastery. Kai names are chosen by senior Kai Masters with the aim of reflecting the individual strengths and qualities of each novice.</p>
       <p>You may create your own Kai name for yourself, or you can generate a Kai name at random using the name tables below. To generate a Kai name, pick a number from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> and consult Table A. The name which corresponds to the number you have picked is the first part, or prefix, of your Kai name. Now pick a second number from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> and consult Table B. The name which corresponds to the number you have picked is the second part, or suffix, of your Kai name. Put the prefix and the suffix together and you have your own personal Kai name.</p>

         <p>After years of martial training and study at the Kai Monastery, and by the rigorous practice of the teachings of your illustrious mentor<ch.emdash/>Kai Supreme Master Lone Wolf<ch.emdash/>you have achieved the noble rank of Kai Grand Master Senior.</p>

         <p>Following in the footsteps of Lone Wolf himself, you have vowed that one day you will become totally proficient in all 16 of the New Order Kai Grand Master Disciplines. By doing so successfully you will share with Lone Wolf the responsibility, the honour, and the future glory of leading the New Order Kai as a Supreme Master.</p>

         <p>If this is the first <cite>New Order</cite> adventure you have undertaken, then your present rank is that of Kai Grand Master Senior. This means that you have mastered <em>four</em> of the New Order Grand Master Disciplines listed below. It is for you to decide which four Disciplines these are. As all of the New Order Grand Master Disciplines may be of use to you at some point during your mission, pick these four skills with care. The correct use of a New Order Grand Master Discipline at the right time could save your life. When you have chosen your four Disciplines, enter them in the Grand Master Disciplines section of your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>.</p>

These bonus points, together with your extra Grand Master Discipline(s), your original four Grand Master Disciplines, your Kai Weapon,<footref id="discplnz-1" idref="discplnz-1-foot"/> and any other Special Items and Backpack Items that you have found and been able to keep during your adventures, may then be carried over and used in the next <cite>New Order</cite> adventure, which is called: <bookref series ="lw" book="25totw"><cite>Trail of the Wolf</cite>.</bookref></p>

       <p>Before you leave the Kai Monastery and commence the crusade upon Duadon, you take with you a <a idref="map">map of the central Stornlands</a> and a pouch of gold. To find out how much gold is in the pouch, pick a number from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> and add 20 to the number you have picked. The total equals the number of Gold Crowns inside the pouch, and you should now enter this number in the <quote>Gold Crowns</quote> section of your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
       <p>If you have successfully completed previous <cite>New Order</cite> adventures (Books 21<ch.endash/>23), you may add this sum to the number of Crowns you already possess. Fifty is the maximum number of Gold Crowns you can carry in your pouch at any time. You may also select five items from the list below, only two of which may be Weapons.</p>

        <data>
         <p>Upon reaching the ultimate rank of Kai Supreme Master, Lone Wolf received as a reward from the God Kai many new skills and abilities. One of these skills was Kai Weaponcraft. Using his newfound mastery, Lone Wolf forged ten weapons of magical power in the armoury furnaces of the Kai Monastery. These magical weapons are reserved for the <ch.eacute/>lite of the New Order Kai who attain the rank of Grand Master.</p>

         <p>In recognition of your rank and achievement, you may choose your own Kai Weapon from the table below or, if you prefer, you can generate one at random. To generate a Kai Weapon, pick a number from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> and consult the first column. The magical Axe, Sword, or Broadsword which corresponds to the number you have picked will be your own personal Kai Weapon. Record this magical weapon and its unique properties in the Kai Weapon section of the <a idref="action">Special Items List</a>.<footref id="equipmnt-1" idref="equipmnt-1-foot"/></p>

         <p><strong>Example</strong></p>
         <p>Say you choose the number 1 from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a>, your Kai Weapon will be the Axe <quote>Alema</quote>.</p>

         <p>When using this Kai Weapon in normal combat you may add <ch.plus/>5 points to your <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ>. Each Kai Weapon has a unique property. When you use your Kai Weapon in combat against the type of enemy that matches its unique property, or use it at the optimum time or location, then you may add the higher bonus to your <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> (these bonuses are not cumulative).</p>

         <p><strong>Example</strong></p>
         <p>If you were to use <quote>Alema</quote> in combat against an undead enemy, you could add the higher bonus of <ch.plus/>7 to your <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ>. If you were to fight a living enemy using this weapon then the bonus to your <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> would remain at <ch.plus/>5.</p>

       <p>There will be occasions during your adventure when you will have to fight an enemy. The enemy<ch.apos/>s <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> and <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points are given in the text. Your aim in the combat is to kill the enemy by reducing his <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points to zero while losing as few <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points as possible yourself.</p>
       <p>At the start of a combat, enter your own and the enemy<ch.apos/>s <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points in the appropriate boxes on the Combat Record section of your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
       <p>The sequence for combat is as follows:</p>
       <ol class="paragraphed">
        <li><p>Add any extra points gained through your Grand Master Disciplines and Special Items to your current <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> total.</p></li>
        <li>
         <p>Subtract the <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> of your enemy from this total. The result is your Combat Ratio. Enter it on the <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
         <p>Example</p>
         <p>You, Grand Master (<typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> 32), are attacked in a forest by a pack of Wild Dogs (<typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> 31). You are taken by surprise and are not given the opportunity of evading their attack. You possess the Grand Master Discipline of Kai-surge to which the Wild Dogs are not immune, so you add 8 points to your <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ>. You also possess the Kai Weapon <quote>Ulnarias</quote>, so you add an additional 5 points to your <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ>. This gives you a total <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> of 45.</p>
         <p>You now subtract the Wild Dogs<ch.apos/> <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> from your own, giving a Combat Ratio of <ch.plus/>14 (45<ch.minus/>31=<ch.plus/>14). <ch.plus/>14 is noted on your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a> as the Combat Ratio.</p>
        </li>
        <li><p><a id="stage3">When you have your Combat Ratio</a>, pick a number from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a>.</p></li>
        <li>
         <p>Turn to the <a idref="crtable">Combat Results Table</a>. Along the top of the chart are shown the Combat Ratio numbers. Find the number that is the same as your Combat Ratio and cross-reference it with the random number that you have picked (the random numbers appear on the side of the chart). You now have the number of <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points lost by both yourself and your enemy in this round of combat. (E represents points lost by the enemy; GM represents points lost by yourself<ch.emdash/>Grand Master.)</p>
         <p>Example</p>
         <p>The Combat Ratio between you and the Wild Dogs has been established as <ch.plus/>14. If the number picked from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> is 1, then the result of the first round of combat is:</p>
         <ul>
          <li>You (GM) lose 3 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points (plus an additional 1 point for using Kai-surge. This loss is in addition to the loss suffered as a result of combat).</li>
          <li>Wild Dogs lose 9 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points.</li>
         </ul>
        </li>
        <li><p>On the <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>, mark the changes in <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points to the participants in the combat.</p></li>
        <li><p>Unless otherwise instructed, or unless you have an option to evade, the next round of combat now starts.</p></li>
        <li><p>Repeat the sequence from <a idref="stage3">Stage 3</a>.</p></li>
       </ol>

       <p>This process of combat continues until the <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points of either your enemy or yourself are reduced to zero or below, at which point that combatant is declared dead. If you are declared dead, the adventure is over. If the enemy is dead, you can proceed but with your <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points possibly reduced.</p>

         <p>During your adventure you may be given the chance to evade combat. If you have already engaged in a round of combat and decide to evade, calculate the combat for that round in the usual manner. All points lost by the enemy as a result of that round are ignored, and you make your escape. Only <strong>you</strong> may lose <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points during that round (such is the risk of turning tail and running away during combat!).

         <dl class="paragraphed">
          <dt>Animal Mastery</dt>
           <dd><p>Kai Grand Master Superiors who possess this Discipline are able to deter predatory animals in the wild by exuding a scent which is repellent to them. In order for this improved Discipline to work effectively, a Kai Grand Master Superior must be aware of the species of predatory animal he/she wishes to deter. The scent can only be detected by the targeted animal.</p></dd>
          <dt>Assimilance</dt>
           <dd><p>Kai Grand Master Superiors who possess this skill are able to create a noise and project it up to 15 yards away from their location. The noise is akin to the rumbling sound of thunder and it can be used to distract or divert an enemy<ch.apos/>s attention. This improved Discipline requires a degree of preparation and therefore it cannot be used during combat.</p></dd>
          <dt>Astrology</dt>
           <dd><p>Kai Grand Master Superiors who possess this Discipline are skilled in the use of all mechanical devices designed to measure and/or observe the cosmology of Magnamund. Such devices include sextants, astrolabes, and orreries.</p></dd>
          <dt>Herbmastery</dt>
           <dd><p>Kai Grand Master Superiors who have this Discipline are able to purify water, thereby making contaminated or briny water suitable for consumption. Roughly two pints of water per day can be purified using this skill alone. This daily total steadily increases as a Grand Master advances in rank.</p></dd>
          <dt>Elementalism</dt>
           <dd><p>Kai Grand Master Superiors who possess this skill are able to condense pure water out of the surrounding air. This water can be made to fall as a fine spray or as a sudden deluge. It can also be made to fill any suitable container or receptacle. Using this skill, Grand Master Superiors can create the equivalent of one large bucketful of fresh water.</p></dd>

          <dt>Astrology</dt>
           <dd><p>Kai Grand Sentinels who possess this Discipline are able to detect psychic residues left on an object by its owner. The more valuable the object is to its owner, the stronger will be the lingering psychic attachment. The majority of everyday or shared objects do not retain such residues.</p></dd>
          <dt>Herbmastery</dt>

     <p>You are about to embark upon a crusade against Lord Vandyan of Eldenora, a cruel tyrant who draws his power from runes created long ago by Agarash the Damned<ch.emdash/>the first champion of the Dark God Naar. The evil power of these ancient stones must be destroyed, and quickly, if Vandyan is to be prevented from enslaving the free kingdoms of Northern Magnamund.</p>

     <p>During your quest, some of the material items that you will encounter will be of use to you, yet others may be red herrings of no real value at all.

       <p>Lone Wolf<ch.apos/>s announcement that the Kai must prepare for a crusade in the Stornlands galvanizes the monastery into a frenzy of activity. Eagerly the members of the New Order set about their duties, and the preparations for the march to Quarlen are completed within two days as planned. On the morning of the third day, the Kai assemble in the training park in full battle-dress. A deathly hush descends upon the gathering as every Kai Lord, from lowly initiate to Grand Master, listens with trepidation as Lone Wolf reads aloud a list of names. One in five of all those present must stay to defend the monastery, and Lone Wolf<ch.apos/>s list contains the names of the one hundred Kai he has chosen to remain behind. As each of these warriors is called, so they leave the assembled ranks to take up guard positions on the battlements and towers. Graciously they accept their lot, though none are glad to have been chosen.</p>
       <p>The march begins shortly before noon. Lone Wolf rides at the head of the column, in the company of nine who comprise yourself, your four fellow Grand Masters, Gwynian the Sage, and a trio of Kai Mentoras who proudly hold aloft the battle-banners of the Kai, the Royal Arms of Sommerlund, and (in Gwynian<ch.apos/>s honour) a scarlet standard bearing the crossed swords of Varetta. The long ride south offers many Sommlending a rare opportunity to see the Kai travelling together in battle-order. Word of your coming spreads quickly through towns and villages that lie on your route, and hundreds turn out to wave and cheer as you pass.</p>

       <p>Favoured by cool dry weather, the column makes swift progress as it crosses the Southlund Marches and enters the remote province of Ruanon. Within a week you have reached Casiorn, the City of Merchants, where fresh provisions and a comfortable billet are provided by High-Mayor Kordas. Lone Wolf learns from Kordas that Vandyan<ch.apos/>s armies have now seized control of Lyris and are grouping along the River Quarl in preparation to push east towards Casiorn itself. Kordas<ch.apos/> mercenaries are holding a defensive line along the river<ch.apos/>s east bank, having destroyed all the bridges at Quarlen to hinder the enemy<ch.apos/>s advance. Their commander, Lord Nathuro of Anari, is keenly awaiting the arrival of the Kai. Less encouraging is the news from Varetta. The city has endured a cruel and relentless bombardment from Vandyan<ch.apos/>s hordes and has suffered many casualties, yet its ancient walls still stand and stoically its citizens are keeping the besieging enemy at bay. The news that Varetta has not fallen raises Gwynian<ch.apos/>s spirits, but few, including the sage himself, expect the city to survive unaided for much longer.</p>
       <p>The column departs from Casiorn early the following day and rides due west towards Quarlen. For four days you follow the highway towards your destination and, with each passing day, so the number of refugees that you encounter steadily increases. Most are Lyrisian, but there are also Deldenian and Salonese among their numbers. Forced out of their homes by the war, they have salvaged what few possessions they can carry and have crossed the River Quarl. Now they are settled in tented encampments all along the fertile valley which separates the Slovarian and Quarlen mountains.</p>

       <p>The densely-packed pines of the Grochod Forest compete for sunlight and fresh air, and beneath the canopy of their thick foliage exists a separate world of shadows and cool gloom. Little undergrowth flourishes here and the soil is loose and rocky, hampering your progress further.

At noon you stop to rest and consult your <a idref="map">map</a>.

       <p>Beyond the archway you discover a long ramp. It descends to the floor of a huge chamber, recently constructed, which is filled with oppressive heat and noise. More than a dozen passages lead away from this domed hall and most are illuminated by the fearsome orange glow of furnace fires. Your Kai senses tell you that these passages lead to Vandyan<ch.apos/>s armouries that are situated on the east side of Skull-Tor.

       <p>The night passes without incident and you awaken at dawn to the shrill sound of bird song. Through the thinning canopy of autumn leaves you can see a forest track which runs parallel to the river. A distant flicker of movement catches your eye and, when you magnify your vision, you see three riders approaching from the south. Two are armed and they wear the uniforms of Eldenoran cavalry scouts, but the third is clad in a tunic of scarlet and black<ch.emdash/>the colours of the Slovian army. His hands are tied and you suspect that he is a prisoner of war. The loss of your sailboat threatens to delay your journey downriver to Tekaro by several days. Mindful of this, you decide to set an ambush for the approaching Eldenoran riders to capture their horses.</p>
       <p>From the cover of the trees that border upon the track, you wait until the riders are close and then you draw upon your Magnakai powers of Animal Control to command their horses to stop. They slow to a halt and, despite their riders<ch.apos/> stinging blows, they refuse to take a step further. Silently you unsheathe your Kai Weapon.

       <p><quote>Vandyan is out for revenge,</quote> says Delissa, as she hurries to her bookcase. <quote>He must have sent every guard in the city out hunting for you this night.</quote> She opens the secret compartment that contains the plans of Skull-Tor, and removes a clear crystal sphere that lies beneath them. You recognize that this sphere is a seeing stone, for Gwynian possesses one that is identical. It is through the use of these seeing stones that he has maintained contact with his agents in Duadon. Delissa places the stone on a table and she recites the arcane words which activate it. A milky mist swirls at its core and then rapidly it dissipates to reveal Gwynian<ch.apos/>s smiling face.</p>
       <p>The wise sage congratulates you for the success of your mission. He tells you that the Vorka have been destroyed and the Eldenoran armies are retreating on every front. He is saddened to hear of Hulsta<ch.apos/>s death and he consoles Delissa with the promise that her husband will be remembered and revered as a hero in the years to come. She is heartened by his kind words and she reaffirms her vow to help keep you safe until you are able to return to your homeland.</p>
       <p>Gwynian informs you both that a rendezvous has been arranged to take place at dusk in three days<ch.apos/> time. You are to meet with Guildmaster Banedon aboard his flying ship <cite>Cloud-dancer</cite> at a place called <quote>Xaitar<ch.apos/>s Rock</quote>. It is a landmark located in the hills 10 miles to the north of Duadon, close to the Luyen road. Delissa says that she knows it well.</p>
       <p><quote>Banedon will take you to Varetta where we shall meet again soon at the Halls of Learning,</quote> says the sage. <quote>But until that glorious day, you must remain vigilant. You have dealt Vandyan a mortal blow. Now that his days are numbered, he will do everything in his power to avenge the destruction of the runes. Be warned, Grand Master. A viper is most dangerous when it knows it is doomed.</quote></p>

       <p>Silently you advance along the dark mine shaft until you see the flicker of candlelight playing upon the rough-hewn walls. The light comes from a cave-like chamber excavated from the tunnel wall. You inch your way nearer, and when you peer around its corner, you see the three Eldenoran soldiers whom you overheard earlier. They sit on a sheet of canvas and are sharing a meal of cold cooked meat and ale. Behind them you see a small wire-haired dog asleep atop a pile of loot that glitters in the light of a solitary candle. The men are fantasizing about how they intend to spend the riches they have looted from Tekaro once the war is over. They are completely unaware of your presence in the tunnel outside until their dog awakens with a start and begins to yap excitedly.</p>

       <p>You crouch beside the body of the Vorka with your weapon held ready to strike. You are expecting to be attacked again at any moment, but something is drawing the creatures away to the river. Then you realize that your provisions have been discovered under the boat<ch.apos/>s canvas, and it is the scent of your food that is enticing them away.</p>
       <p>The Vorka rush through the trees, but they arrive too late to share in the unexpected feast and they proceed to vent their frustrations on the boat itself. You are taken aback by the sheer speed and ferocity of their attack which reduces your sailboat to matchwood. Silently you watch as they go back to the bridge and cross once more to the other side of the river. The incident seems to have amused the Eldenoran guards, and you can hear them laughing and cursing wildly. You decide to wait until their excitement has cooled a little before you attempt to leave your hiding place. During your wait you must eat a Meal or lose 3 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points (you are unable to use Grand Huntmastery to forage for food in this instance).</p>

       <p>From an archway at the far end of this marble chamber, the murmur of distant voices is carried along by a cool breeze. Stealthily you explore this arch and the dark passageway that lies beyond. It leads to a shaft where you descend by slope and stair to what appears, at first, to be a dead end. However, your Kai Sixth Sense quickly determines that the seemingly blank walls at the base of the shaft conceal a secret door. You detect a lever near the floor, and when you push it down, a section of the wall slides open to reveal a curtained arch. The voices are louder now and you approach the arch with caution. You are about to reach out and grasp the velvet curtains, when an unexpected noise at your back makes you wince. The secret door has closed and locked behind you. Fearful of what may lie ahead, yet unable now to retrace your steps, you peek through a gap in the curtains and your pulse races when you catch your first glimpse of what lies beyond.</p>

       <p><quote>Drag him down!</quote> growls the sergeant, and two of his men discard their spears and rush forward to carry out his order. You snatch back on your horse<ch.apos/>s reins and he rears up, kicking hard, his forelegs connecting with the soldiers<ch.apos/> chests to send them sprawling in the dirt. Their comrades are startled by your rearing horse and they back off in confusion, giving you space in which to turn him about and gallop away into a nearby alley. As you race along this deserted passageway, you glance over your shoulder and see that the reeves have recovered and they are now pursuing you. The alley turns to the right and comes to a dead end. Facing you is a three-storey townhouse with a balcony which overhangs a pair of stable doors. The lock is broken and so you pull open a door and urge your horse to enter the gloomy interior. Quickly you dismount in the darkness and wedge the doors shut with the shaft of a hammer you find discarded on the straw-covered ground. Moments later you hear the echoing footfalls of the reeves as they come running around the corner. Their sergeant orders them to check the entrance of every house bordering the <foreign xml:lang="fr">cul-de-sac</foreign>. Two soldiers approach and the stable doors rattle when they push against them with the butts of their spears. You wait with bated breath, fearing they will try to force them open, but they are satisfied that the doors must be bolted from the inside and they move on to check the next house. After a few minutes you hear the soldiers leaving the square. Then a yellowy light flares up behind you, and you spin around to see an old woman standing in a doorway at the top of a short flight of stone steps. She is holding a lantern in one hand and a bread knife in the other.</p>

       <p>You pull open the iron door and discover an unguarded antechamber which leads to an echoing hall. Along the left wall of this windswept hallway are tall arched windows that command a view of the parade ground surrounding the inner keep of Skull-Tor. You recall Hulsta speaking about this keep shortly before his untimely death and, when you focus your Kai senses upon its imposing walls, you detect that it harbours the evil power that you have come to destroy. From the cover of the antechamber, you observe the keep and determine that entry to it can only be gained via a drawbridge which gives access to an archway located 20 feet above the ground. To reach this bridge, you will have to ascend to the next level of Skull-Tor. This will not be an easy task, for the hallway and the parade ground are swarming with Eldenoran officers and Vorka slaves.</p>

From the cover of the shadows, you observe the large flagstoned square at the approach to the South Gate and note that the traffic of wagons has resumed.

You are presently in the Southern Quarter of Duadon and so you enter the square and follow the line of wagons that is heading towards Skull-Tor. You are hoping that this avenue will be the quickest way to reach the Northern Quarter, but unfortunately your plan comes to a premature end when you discover that Bannerway has been reserved for the use of supply wagons only. Armed guardsmen control access to the avenue and they turn you away as you are about to enter on foot. Undeterred, you resolve to find another route across Duadon to the Northern Quarter. Looking around the soot-blackened buildings, you see two other roads that lead off from the South Gate square to the east and west. The west road is called Knucklebone Lane and the east road is called Kettle Street.</p>

Swearing vengeance, he leaps at you and swings his bladed polearm at your head.</p>

       <p>You leave the glassblower<ch.apos/>s workshop and turn the corner into North Watch Lane. Here you discover a dozen small shops that trade in weapons and armour. Most of the items they offer for sale are poorly crafted, but there is one shop which specializes in fine weapons imported from all over Magnamund. Your eye is caught by an impressive collection of Siyenese bows and Lourdenian swords on display in its front window.</p>

       <p>You intone the words of the Brotherhood Spell <spell>Sense Evil</spell> and at once your mind is flooded with terrible images. Beneath the soil of this clearing lie the bodies of a thousand Slovian prisoners of war. Captured when Tekaro fell, they were brought here by Eldenoran guards and murdered by the merciless Vorka. This clearing is the site of their mass grave and you can detect a strong psychic presence. Mostly it comprises a lingering residue formed by the souls of the innocent men who were murdered here, but there is also something else<ch.emdash/>something invisible yet wholly evil. Your heart pounds when you suddenly realize that an evil entity has come here to feed upon the psychic remains of the slain Slovian prisoners. You sense it poses a grave and immediate threat to your life, and hurriedly you turn and run through the trees in your haste to escape its clutches.</p>

       <p>Aided by your Sixth Sense, you hear the third tumbler click into position.<footref id="sect40-1" idref="sect40-1-foot"/> There is a soft whirring sound, and then the door swings open to reveal a vaulted corridor which leads to a flight of iron steps. You enter, and the great door swings shut behind you. There is a junction halfway along the corridor where another passage crosses from left to right. You hurry across and climb the metal steps, but as you are approaching the top of the stairs, you catch a glimpse of two armoured guards beyond. They are standing to attention before a large door that is engraved with mystic symbols. You feel a strong concentration of evil here and, at once, you sense that the Runes of Agarash lie on the other side of this door. Instinctively you duck below the guards<ch.apos/> line of sight, and then quietly you retreat to the junction.</p>
       <p>Here you detect the sound of footsteps approaching, and when you spin around to face them, you see a young kitchen attendant walking along the passageway towards you. He is carrying a tray laden with food and he stops abruptly when he sees you suddenly appear. Fearful that he may raise the alarm, you stride towards him and say in an accusing tone: <quote>Why are you late, boy? Lord Vandyan has been kept waiting more than an hour for his food!</quote></p>
       <p><quote>But<ch.ellips/>but this is not for his lordship,</quote> answers the young man, clearly confused by your rebuke. <quote>It<ch.apos/>s for the guards at the door to the Rune Hall.</quote></p>
       <p><quote>What!</quote> you reply, feigning outrage. <quote>You mean to say that you would put the feeding of two lowly guards before our master<ch.apos/>s needs! This is intolerable!</quote></p>
       <p><quote>No<ch.ellips/>no<ch.ellips/>I mean, I was told by the cook to take this tray to the guards. Lord Vandyan ate a meal in his chambers some three hours ago. I<ch.apos/>ve had no order to take him food since.</quote></p>

       <p>Forcefully you snatch the tray from the bemused assistant, saying: <quote>Go tell cook to prepare him something substantial, understand? He<ch.apos/>s very hungry. I<ch.apos/>ll deliver these scraps to the guards myself.</quote> The confused young assistant scratches his head and then he hurries away to deliver your order to the cook. You watch him until he turns a distant corner, and then you look down at the tray of cold meat and vegetables and an idea takes shape, an idea that may help you gain entry to the Rune Hall.</p>

       <p><quote>I<ch.apos/>ve found him!</quote> he bellows, and six guardsmen who are searching the yard come racing up the stairs with their swords drawn. You fight bravely and slay them all, but the word of your whereabouts quickly spreads and within minutes you are cornered in the cooperage by more than a hundred of Vandyan<ch.apos/>s troops. Their leader has placed a bounty of 10,000 Gold Crowns upon your head, payable upon delivery of your body to Skull-Tor, dead or alive. Spurred on by the promise of this huge reward, his troops attack you repeatedly until you are finally overwhelmed by the sheer weight of numbers.</p>
       <p>You may take some comfort in the fact that you fulfilled your vital mission. By destroying the Runes of Agarash you have saved Magnamund from the tyrannical rule of Vandyan. It is a great victory, but one that you have paid for with your life.</p>

       <p><quote>Very well, I<ch.apos/>ll pay what you ask,</quote> you reply. Quickly the guards wave the wagon through into the city and then they lower the portcullis and order the following traffic to wait while they escort you to the gatehouse. You are beginning to think that they are going to renege on their deal and throw you in a cell regardless, but the taller guard soon eases your fears. Quietly he says to you: <quote>Don<ch.apos/>t worry, friend. We<ch.apos/>ll jus<ch.apos/> go somewhere private. We don<ch.apos/>t want all o<ch.apos/> Duadon to know our business.</quote></p>
       <p>You accompany the guards into the gatehouse and along a corridor to an empty chamber where a small door is set into the wall. You hand over the 10 Gold Crowns (erase these from your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>) and the guards unlock the door. It opens on to a quiet alleyway overshadowed by the city<ch.apos/>s south wall. <quote>Off y<ch.apos/>go, trooper,</quote> says the tall guard, as he pushes you through the arched doorway.</p>
       <p>The door shuts behind you with a dull thud and you hear a key turning in the lock. You leave the door and walk along the alleyway towards the gatehouse arch. From the shadows, you observe the large flagstoned square at the approach to the South Gate and note that the traffic of wagons has resumed. They trundle across the square and enter a wide avenue called Bannerway, which leads to Vandyan<ch.apos/>s stronghold of Skull-Tor at the centre of the city.</p>
       <p>You recall Gwynian<ch.apos/>s briefing that the agents you must contact can be found in Flank Street, in the city<ch.apos/>s Northern Quarter. You are presently in the Southern Quarter of Duadon and so you enter the square and follow the line of wagons that is heading towards Skull-Tor. You are hoping that this avenue will be the quickest way to reach the Northern Quarter, but unfortunately your plan comes to a premature end when you discover that Bannerway has been reserved for the use of supply wagons only. Armed guardsmen control access to the avenue and they turn you away as you are about to enter on foot. Undeterred, you resolve to find another route across Duadon to the Northern Quarter. Looking around the soot-blackened buildings, you see two other roads that lead off from the South Gate square to the east and west. The west road is called Knucklebone Lane and the east road is called Kettle Street.</p>

       <p>Rouf praises your deadly skill. You acknowledge him with a nod of your head and then you turn and enter the cabin. Prizo and his wife scream when you appear, for you are wearing an Eldenoran uniform and they think you have come to finish them off. But their terror soon turns to joy when they see Rouf following behind you. <quote>Don<ch.apos/>t fear!</quote> says Rouf. <quote>Your ordeal<ch.apos/>s over. My companion<ch.apos/>s an ally, not an enemy.</quote></p>
       <p>Quickly you untie them and tearfully they hug Rouf. His uncle and aunt are overcome with emotion to see their favourite nephew once more. Quickly he explains that, despite your uniform, you are not an Eldenoran. When he then reveals that you are a Kai Lord on a secret mission, their eyes widen with awe. Prizo warns you that there are many Eldenorans in this area and that it is no longer a safe place. He invites you both to stay here this night but he says you must remain watchful. Reluctantly Prizo and his wife have decided to leave their home. They plan to cross the Quarl and seek shelter in Salony. Many Slovian refugees, including other members of Rouf<ch.apos/>s family, have found sanctuary there in the Great Forest and they plan to join them.</p>
       <p>You and Rouf take turns to keep watch during the night, and shortly before dawn you awaken his uncle and aunt. Fie prepares a delicious breakfast and while you are eating they discuss their plans. Rouf has decided to join his aunt and uncle and go with them to Salony. You tell them that you must continue with your mission and try to cross the River Storn near Tekaro. Prizo repeats Rouf<ch.apos/>s warning that the city is occupied by the Eldenorans and encircled by Vorka regiments, but he also has some extra information that might be useful. He says that the Eldenorans have set up a military ferry on the Storn, five miles south of the confluence where the two rivers, the Quarl and the Storn, meet. In your disguise as an Eldenoran scout, you may find it is the easiest way to cross the river.</p>
       <p>After breakfast, you thank Rouf and his kin for their help and you wish them luck on their journey to Salony. In return they thank you for freeing them and Fie offers you some food for the road ahead (enough for 2 Meals). Then they bid you farewell and wave goodbye from the doorway as you leave the cabin and go to retrieve your horse.</p>

Already I have harnessed the might of the first rune and used it to create and control the Vorka horde. With the power of the second stone I summoned Zorkaan the Soultaker and bound him to our cause.

The approaching storms from the north herald the rebirth of the Vaag, the flying spawn of Agarash the Damned!</quote></p>

       <p>Vandyan<ch.apos/>s announcement draws a loud gasp of astonishment from his officers. Legend has it that the Vaag were the most ruthless and deadly of all the Agarashi<ch.emdash/>the creatures of darkness created by Agarash the Damned. He used the Vaag to spearhead assaults upon ancient Magnamund that led to his domination of the entire planet during the Age of Eternal Night. Unhindered by mountains, rivers, and city walls, a flying horde of Vaag could indeed be a force capable of conquering Magnamund anew.</p>
       <p><quote>Go now!</quote> says Vandyan, to his stunned officers. <quote>Return to your armies in the field and be ready to march. You have your orders<ch.emdash/>do not fail me. I must now return to my laboratory and attend to the final preparations. Be assured, my loyal countrymen. Soon all Magnamund shall cower at our feet!</quote></p>
       <p>Vandyan<ch.apos/>s final words are met with a thunderous roar of approval. The door in the north wall opens and he leaves the dais and hurries through it. As the door closes behind him with a dull boom, the Eldenoran officers gather up their maps and papers and file out of the hall, through a pair of double doors which have opened in the south wall.</p>

The group splits in two with one half descending to the river to investigate your boat, while the remainder spread out and begin a search of the trees.

       <p>You cross the corridor and approach the door. Your Kai Sixth Sense tells you that the chamber beyond it is empty, and so you twist the handle and push against the heavy portal. Silently it swings open on well-oiled hinges to reveal an empty circular room. A large iron-rimmed chute is set into its stone wall, and when you examine this opening, your stomach churns. Its surfaces are smeared with traces of human blood. You can hear the distant sound of rushing water and suddenly you realize that this chute leads directly to the river which flows beneath Duadon. From its condition and location you conclude that this chute has a single, sinister purpose: it is used by the gaolers of Skull-Tor for the swift disposal of prisoners who die in their charge.</p>
       <p>As you turn to leave this grim chamber, you notice a Mace and a Small Shovel standing propped against the wall, close to the door. If you wish to take either of these items, record them on your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>. Upon leaving, you close the door behind you before continuing along the corridor.</p>

       <p>You descend from the ridge and trek across a fallow field towards the derelict remains of Castle Demera, an ancient Eldenoran fortress that was besieged and destroyed by the Salonese in the year MS<ch.nbsp/>4417. Its curtain walls and central keep have long since disappeared, and what little remains of its outer walls is now barely recognizable beneath a blanket of thick moss which covers every surface.</p>
       <p>You enter the base of the outer walls and discover a flight of slime-smeared steps leading down into a stone chamber which offers some protection from the heavy rain. The mouldering walls of this chamber are buried beneath a profusion of plants and creepers. You take a closer look at the plants and, to your surprise, you discover a clump of laumspur hidden among the vegetation. (There is sufficient Laumspur here for 2 potions. Each Potion of Laumspur will restore 4 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points to your total when swallowed after combat.) Heartened by this unexpected discovery, you settle yourself in the driest corner of the chamber and drift off to sleep.</p>
       <p>The trundling sound of heavy wagons awakens you shortly after dawn. The rain has ceased during the night and the ruins are now bathed in warm autumn sunlight that is filtering through gaps in the clouds. On reaching the surface, you look out across the surrounding fields and catch sight of a sunken road less than a mile away to the north. Columns of Eldenoran army wagons are moving along this highway in both directions. You magnify your vision and see that the wagons heading southeast, towards the River Storn, are heavily laden with supplies. The wagons that travel in the opposite direction, towards Duadon, are mostly empty.</p>

       <p>Silently you intone the words of the Brotherhood Spell <spell>Mind Charm</spell> and order the Guard Captain to set you free. You also command him mentally to forget that he has ever set eyes on you upon the instant that you leave his chamber. The captain obeys without question. He calls his guards and tells them to set you free in Duadon immediately. They are shocked and surprised to hear this, but they dare not contradict their superior officer.</p>
       <p>Reluctantly the guards march you away. They escort you along a corridor which leads to an empty room where a small door is set into a stone wall. It opens on to a quiet alleyway that is overshadowed by the city<ch.apos/>s south battlements.</p>
       <p><quote>Be off with you!</quote> growls the tall guard, as he pushes you roughly through the arched doorway. The door shuts behind you with a dull thud and you hear a key turning in the lock. Quickly you leave this door and walk briskly along the alleyway towards the gatehouse arch. From the shadows, you observe the large flagstoned square at the approach to the South Gate and note that the traffic of wagons has resumed.

You are hoping that this avenue will be the quickest way to reach the Northern Quarter, but unfortunately your plan comes to a premature end when you discover that Bannerway has been reserved for the use of supply wagons only. Armed guardsmen control access to the avenue and they turn you away as you attempt to enter on foot. Undeterred, you resolve to find another route across Duadon to the Northern Quarter. Looking around the soot-blackened buildings, you see two other roads which lead off from the South Gate square, to the east and west. The west road is called Knucklebone Lane and the east road is called Kettle Street.</p>

       <p>None of the arrows find their mark, but a piece of rock smashes into the planking near your feet. It tears a hole in the bottom of the boat and a spout of water gushes into the air to rain down upon your head. The Eldenorans cheer as your boat begins to founder. As it disappears from view beneath the centre arch, you hear their echoing footfalls as they rush across to the opposite side of the bridge to wait for you to reappear. When you emerge they laugh and jeer. The water is rushing in so fast now that you decide you must abandon the boat. You turn the rudder towards the left bank and aim your sinking craft at a place where a copse of willow trees overhangs the river. As you pass beneath the branches, you clamber out and quickly take cover among the trees.</p>
       <p>The Eldenorans soon arrive to search the boat and the surrounding area. They fail to discover you and silently you observe them from the undergrowth as they drag your half-submerged craft out of the water and sift through its meagre contents. When they tire of this, they return to their duties at the bridge. Once the coast is clear, you leave the copse and hurry away. Only when you have put more than five miles between yourself and the Eldenorans do you dare stop to rest for a few hours in the bough of an oak tree.</p>

       <p>Your blow catches the enemy rider in the throat, at a weak point in his armour where the base of his helmet joins the top of his breastplate. Mortally wounded, he fights desperately to hang on to his reins as he falls from the saddle, but in so doing, he unbalances his warhorse and brings the creature crashing down on top of him. You press on through the resulting gap, and glance back to see Delissa following closely on your heels. She is an expert horsewoman and you are greatly impressed by her courage and skill. As you break free from the converging horsemen, you hear a crash of metal and the anguished cry of men and horses: the two units of Sinistrari have collided with calamitous effect. Most of the riders have been unseated, and several have perished beneath the crushing weight of their armoured horses. Only one rider appears to have survived the collision unscathed and he immediately gives chase. As you gallop towards the plateau, you glance back repeatedly at your solitary pursuer and you notice that he is stripping off pieces of his armour to lighten his horse<ch.apos/>s burden. In so doing he is able to keep pace with your lighter mounts.</p>
       <p>On reaching the plateau, you see a range of hills in the distance and Delissa points towards a pinnacle of rock that is shaped like a church spire.</p>
       <p><quote>Xaitar<ch.apos/>s Rock!</quote> she cries, identifying the place for your rendezvous with Guildmaster Banedon. You look back once more and this time you are shocked to see that the Sinistrari rider is fast closing the gap. You realize that he will reach you before you are able to arrive at Xaitar<ch.apos/>s Rock, and so you signal to Delissa to ride on ahead.</p>
       <p><quote>Go on!</quote> you shout. <quote>I<ch.apos/>ll join you there!</quote> As she gallops past, you bring your horse around to face your pursuer, and you raise your Kai Weapon in readiness to attack. Then you urge your horse forwards and race headlong towards your enemy. As you close to within 20 yards, you see him whirling his spiked ball and chain around his head as he gets ready to strike you down.</p>

       <p>You walk along Flank Avenue, past the establishments of moneylenders, wagoneers, and rope-makers, until you come to a flagstoned square before the city<ch.apos/>s East Gate. A column of scaly-skinned Vorka are marching across the square and out through the gate, accompanied by young fresh-faced Eldenoran officers on horseback. You stop to watch the Vorka and, when you look back along their ranks, you see a busy street which leads to the centre of the city. Lurking behind a hazy curtain of acrid grey smoke is the fortress of Skull-Tor, less than half a mile distant. It is from here that the Vorka are emerging. Like some foul discharge, they flow forth in green streams from the newly-constructed armouries that adjoin Vandyan<ch.apos/>s grim stronghold.</p>
       <p>You resolve to avoid Skull-Tor and continue along Flank Wall in the hope that it will lead directly to Flank Street.

Beyond the gate you enter a broad street lit by hanging lanterns. Drunken soldiers reel and sprawl along the alleyways that feed into this main avenue, and patrols of military reeves attempt in vain to maintain some semblance of order. Houses stand barred and barricaded, and the frightened eyes of native Tekaroans squint through their shuttered windows at the raucous enemy soldiers.</p>

You are about to enter the square when suddenly a patrol of military reeves comes marching around a corner, forcing you to halt to avoid colliding with them. At first their sharp-eyed sergeant simply glowers at you, but then he proceeds to scrutinize your uniform and your horse. Gruffly he demands to know what you are doing in this part of the city. Your Kai Sixth Sense tells you that he has noticed that the regimental number on the sleeve of your tunic does not tally with any of the regiments billeted in Tekaro, and you suspect he is thinking that you are deserter.</p>

Looking around the soot-blackened buildings, you see two other roads which lead off from the South Gate square, to the east and west. The west road is called Knucklebone Lane and the east road is called Kettle Street.</p>

       <p>You retrieve the Potion of Gallowbrush from your pack and pour it carefully over the slices of cold meat. Then you cover the meat with vegetables and carry the tray to the guards on duty at the Rune Hall. They prop their halberds against the wall and raise the visors of their helmets as you approach.</p>
       <p><quote>Where<ch.apos/>s Gragov?</quote> asks a guard, as you set the tray of food down on a small table beside the door.</p>
       <p><quote>He<ch.apos/>s gone sick,</quote> you reply.</p>
       <p><quote>I hope it wasn<ch.apos/>t something he ate!</quote> jokes the other guard.</p>
       <p>You can hear the guards eating their food as you walk back along the corridor towards the iron stairs. When you reach the bottom step, you wait here to allow the potion to take effect. After a few minutes you hear a metallic crash, and when you peer over the top step you see that the potion has done its work. Both guards are now lying unconscious in front of the door.</p>

       <p>Reluctantly, they uncross their spears and allow you to march out across the drawbridge, towards the open archway of the inner keep. As you reach the middle of the bridge, you look to your right and see plumes of black smoke rising up into the night sky. They originate from the chimneys of armouries located on the east side of Skull-Tor. Even at this late hour they are in full production, manufacturing an unending supply of weapons and armour for Vandyan<ch.apos/>s Vorka hordes.</p>
       <p>Upon entering the archway of the inner keep, you find yourself standing in a circular hall that is hung with tapestries and framed portraits. At a desk positioned in the middle of this hall sits an Eldenoran scribe who is busily writing in a ledger with a quill pen. He is so engrossed with his work that he does not acknowledge your presence in any way. Behind him you see a flight of stairs spiralling up to the floor above, and on either side of the entrance arch there are open portals which lead off to the left and right.</p>

       <p>As the last of the Eldenorans falls victim to your deadly blows, the mongrel dog yelps with fright and bounds away along the tunnel. You wipe and sheathe your weapon and then enter the chamber to investigate the Eldenoran<ch.apos/>s hoard of loot.</p>
       <p>Among bulging bags of silver Slovian Lune, ornate candlesticks, polished silver plates, and gemstones, you uncover one item of greater value than all of the others put together. It is a golden chalice set with rubies and emeralds. You examine it closely and conclude that it was stolen from Tekaro Cathedral. (If you wish to take the Tekaro Chalice, record it on your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a> as a Backpack Item.)</p>
       <p>Having satisfied yourself that you have not overlooked anything else of special value, you leave the mine and continue your trek along the ravine. Night is fast approaching and you have barely covered a mile when the ravine comes to an abrupt end at the edge of a deep gorge. Less than a hundred yards away to the west you can see the outline of a rocky knoll with a slate base that juts out over the rim of this steep, wooded valley. To the east, the gorge cuts a deep furrow through the forest for many miles. There appears to be no easy way of avoiding the gorge, but you are unwilling to attempt a descent in the dark. Instead, you decide to find somewhere safe nearby where you can make camp and await the dawn.</p>

The centre of the hall is dominated by a large refectory table around which are huddled groups of Eldenoran officers.

       <p>You await your chance and then you slip out from behind the curtain when nobody is looking in your direction.

When she is satisfied that you will pass for her cousin Jac, you leave the parlour and collect two saddled horses from a small stable at the rear of the workshop. You mount up and Delissa leads the way along an alley that gives access to Flank Street. At the end of the street you arrive at a plaza located before the city<ch.apos/>s North Gate. It is late afternoon, a time when this square is normally crowded with people, yet as you ride towards the north gatehouse you can count the number of citizens that you see on the fingers of one hand.</p>

The sergeant arrives and greets Delissa with a wide smile. They are old friends. The sergeant listens sympathetically to her story that you are her cousin and together you are bound for Luyen to nurse her sick sister. When she has finished her tale, the sergeant nods his approval to a face that is peering out from a window of the gatehouse.

There are several exits from this square, but you choose the least-busy one to make your escape. This tree-lined avenue bears west towards Tekaro Cathedral. The Eldenorans have turned the city<ch.apos/>s magnificent building into a dormitory for their troops and, as you pass by its grand doors, you glimpse hundreds of soldiers sleeping on the floor of its central nave. Guards posted on the steps regard your bloodstained clothing with suspicion as your horse plods its way forward.

       <p>At the end of a street flanked by warehouses and guildhalls, you come to the city<ch.apos/>s south gatehouse. A guard casts a cursory glance at you and, upon seeing that you are a scout, he pulls a chain which operates the heavy oak portal. As the gate creaks open you ride through it and out onto the highway beyond. This broad road runs parallel to the shimmering waters of the River Storn and you follow it for a few miles before turning your horse away towards the river. As you approach the rushing waters, you happen upon a derelict hut in the middle of a copse of apple trees picked bare by the invading army.

Wild-eyed with manic excitement, he stares intently at the crystal saucer and seems not to notice that you are about to cut him down. But as you make your attack, he snatches up an iron staff that protrudes from a hole in the platform, and expertly he fends off your blow. The blade of your weapon trails a line of sparks as it scrapes along the length of his staff and clatters against the rail which encircles the platform. He stabs at you with its clawed tip and you dodge this vicious blow, but then you strike again and send the staff spinning from his hands. He emits a strangled cry of fear and frustration and backs away to the edge of the platform. Glancing to the crystal saucer, and then to the glinting weapon that you hold in your hands, suddenly his nerve breaks. He kicks a lever at the edge of the platform and a trapdoor springs open to reveal a dangling rope. Cursing you and vowing eternal revenge, he scrambles through the trapdoor and slides rapidly down the rope to the hall below. As he runs towards the door your first instinct is to pursue him, to prevent him from getting away. But your Kai senses warn you that the storm is peaking. Unless you smash the last remaining rune, the Vaag will materialize and Vandyan will have won.</p>

       <p>Having finished your briefing, Gwynian and Lone Wolf show you to a room at the rear of the tavern where some items of clothing have been laid out for your inspection. Lone Wolf tells you to take off your helmet and Kai battle-armour and exchange them for the plain green tunic, breeches, and cloak of a Kai journeyman that lie draped across a table.</p>
       <p><quote>These clothes will serve you well,</quote> he says, as he buckles the clasp of your cloak. <quote>They are far less likely to attract unwelcome attentions during your journey to Duadon.</quote></p>

Lone Wolf and Gwynian bid you good luck and leave the room to allow you to rest. You manage to get a few hours<ch.apos/> uneasy sleep before Gwynian returns shortly before midnight. The sage escorts you from the tavern and leads you down to the waterfront, to a wharf where a battered little sailboat lies tethered alongside a river barge. At first glance this sailboat looks completely unseaworthy, but upon closer inspection you see that it has been carefully camouflaged with broken timbers and ripped canvas to give the impression that it is a wreck. Stowed on board are a pair of oars and enough food and water for the voyage downstream to Tekaro. You board the boat and Gwynian casts off the mooring rope, bidding you good luck and godspeed as gently the current carries you away.</p>

       <p>The waters of the Quarl are fast-flowing and you have no need of sail nor oar to propel you. By means of the rudder, you are able to steer the boat and let the current carry you swiftly downstream towards your destination. When dawn breaks you are able to take stock of your surroundings. You are making good progress and you calculate that it should take you no more than three days to reach Tekaro. The first day passes uneventfully and you are able to relax and enjoy the views of the fertile countryside that fringes the Quarl. But as darkness begins to fall at the end of the second day, you catch sight of something in the distance that sets your pulse racing. As you round a bend, you see a stone bridge spanning the river little more than a mile downstream. A line of burning torches is fixed along its parapeted walls, and armed guards are positioned on either side of its span. A look at your <a idref="map">map</a> tells you that this bridge carries the road that connects the towns of Woeld and Tido, and when you magnify your vision, you see that the guards are enemy soldiers. They wear studded leather jerkins and have the circle-and-star emblem of Eldenora engraved upon their conical steel helmets. To your dismay, an eagle-eyed lookout posted at the centre of the bridge sees your boat approaching. He alerts his fellow guards and quickly they line up along the parapet of the bridge and unshoulder their bows. One of their number blows a shrill whistle which attracts the attention of a second group who are moving through the trees which border the right bank. Your stomach churns when you catch your first sight of these troops for they are not human<ch.emdash/>they are Vorka. These lizard-like creatures move with a sinister grace which betrays their ancient origins. A cold fire glows in the depths of their sharp, blinking eyes, and their scaly bodies are bedecked with fragments of armour, mostly rotting leather and chainmail looted from the bodies of their slain foes.</p>

The tips of some of their arrows are wound round with strips of oily cloth and they have been set alight.

       <p>Rouf is hugged by his uncle and aunt who are overcome with emotion to see their favourite nephew once more. They thank you both for freeing them and they curse the Eldenorans who invaded their home. When Rouf tells his kin that you are a Kai Lord on a secret mission, their eyes widen with awe. Prizo warns you that there are many Eldenorans in this area and that it is no longer a safe place. He invites you both to stay here this night but he says you must remain watchful. Reluctantly Prizo and his wife have decided to leave their home. They plan to cross the Quarl and seek shelter in Salony. Many Slovian refugees, including other members of Rouf<ch.apos/>s family, have found sanctuary there in the Great Forest.</p>
       <p>You and Rouf take turns to keep watch during the night, and shortly before dawn you awaken his uncle and aunt. Fie prepares a delicious breakfast and while you are eating they discuss their plans. Rouf has decided to join his aunt and uncle and go with them to Salony. You tell them that you must continue with your mission and try to cross the River Storn near Tekaro. Prizo repeats Rouf<ch.apos/>s warning that the city is occupied by the Eldenorans, but he also has some information that could be useful. He says that the Eldenorans have set up a military ferry on the Storn, five miles south of the confluence where the two rivers, the Quarl and the Storn, meet. In your disguise as an Eldenoran scout, you may find it the easiest way to cross the river.</p>
       <p>After breakfast, you thank Rouf and his kin for their help and you wish them luck on their journey to Salony. In return they thank you for freeing them and Fie offers you some food for the road ahead (enough for 2 Meals). Then they bid you farewell and wave goodbye from the doorway as you leave the cabin and go to retrieve your horse.</p>

       <p>The blow from your enemy<ch.apos/>s spiked ball and chain renders you unconscious and sends you spinning out of the saddle. You are spared the pain of impact when you crash head-first to the highway, but sadly you never regain consciousness. The Sinistrari captain brings his horse about and ruthlessly he tramples your helpless body beneath his hooves. Death is painless and instantaneous.</p>
       <p>You may take some comfort from the fact that you fulfilled your vital mission. By destroying the Runes of Agarash you have saved Magnamund from the tyrannical rule of Vandyan and his monstrous horde. It is a great victory, but one that you have paid for with your life.</p>

A violent storm is approaching and droplets of rain are already beginning to spatter your head and shoulders.</p>
       <p>You hurry along the ravine in search of shelter from the coming storm. Lightning is striking closer, forking down into the forest with spectacular effect. You have barely covered a mile of the shallow ravine when it ends abruptly at the edge of a deep gorge. Less than a hundred yards away to the west, you can see a rocky knoll with a slate base that juts out over the rim of this steep valley. To the east, the gorge cuts a deep furrow through the timberland for several miles. There is no easy way to avoid the gorge, but equally you have no wish to descend it during a storm. The rain is getting heavier and the lightning strikes are increasing, and so you decide to seek safe shelter at the rocky knoll.</p>

Cold air rushes out, chilling your face, and your Kai senses tingle when you feel the evil power of the runes bleeding from the hall beyond. Steeling yourself for what may lie ahead, you push against the door again and slip in through the widening gap.</p>
       <p>Before you lies a magnificent chamber hewn from polished obsidian. Colossal columns rise along its curved walls, and iron cradles filled with glowing stones illuminate the jet-black surfaces. Away to your right you can see a metal staircase leading down to the bottom of a vast pit. At its centre there stands a great black bell-like object that is sheathed with crackling energies, sparking and fusing noisily. You take a step forward and gasp when you first see the line of Vorka that are emerging from the side of this belled chamber. Like scaly automatons, they march forth in an endless stream that disappears into an archway on the far side of the pit. You sense the presence of a rune and, when you scour the bell-chamber using your magnified vision, you glimpse the oblong of black stone embedded into its surface.</p>

Within its core there stands a frozen column of black mist, and set into a hollow in its flared top you can see a second rune.</p>
       <p>Your Sixth Sense tells you that there are three runes present in this great hall, yet it is not until you look up at the domed ceiling that you locate the third. On a wide circular platform suspended below an aperture at the top of the dome, you see Lord Vandyan.

Through the aperture in the dome you can see the night sky. Cold winds howl and bolts of lightning flash and sizzle, ripping apart the clouds as the power of a supernatural storm builds to a frightening crescendo above Skull-Tor.</p>

       <p>At the end of a street flanked by warehouses and guildhalls, you come to the city<ch.apos/>s south gatehouse. A guard casts a cursory glance at your uniform and, upon seeing that you are a scout, he pulls a chain which operates the heavy oak portal. As the gate creaks open, you ride through it and out onto the highway beyond. This broad road runs parallel to the shimmering waters of the River Storn and you follow it for a few miles before turning your horse away towards the river. As you approach the rushing waters, you happen upon a derelict hut in the middle of a copse of apple trees picked bare by the invading army.

Hulsta passes you his lantern and, as you rest it on the tunnel floor, you are pleased to see that you have emerged at a point beyond the wall. Hurriedly you help pull your companion out of the freezing water. He is shivering uncontrollably and he cannot move his legs. Using your innate Kai healing powers, you are able to transmit warmth into his frozen muscles and restore the blood circulation. (Use of your Discipline in this way costs you 2 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points.)</p>
       <p>When Hulsta has recovered the full use of his legs, you continue your exploration of the tunnel towards the east. You have covered several hundred yards before he calls you to a halt. He holds his lantern up to the wall and you notice that the stonework is changing. A ragged seam encircles the tunnel where brown brickwork meets rough grey rock.</p>
       <p><quote>This is good,</quote> says Hulsta, approvingly. <quote>We<ch.apos/>re passing through the granite foundations of Skull-Tor. According to the plans, this tunnel runs to a dungeon store room. It is located three levels below the surface. We have not far to go now<ch.emdash/>perhaps two hundred paces at most.</quote></p>
       <p>You are about to lead the way when suddenly you hear a rumbling sound and feel a tremor run through the floor.</p>
       <p><quote>What was that?</quote> you ask, anxiously.</p>
       <p><quote>Ore wagons, most likely,</quote> replies Hulsta. <quote>We must be directly below the West Gate of Skull-Tor.</quote></p>
       <p>Hulsta stops to replace the candle in his lantern, and as he does so, you ask him what you can expect to find when you reach the tunnel<ch.apos/>s end.</p>
       <p><quote>The plans indicated a secret panel which can be opened from both sides,</quote> he replies. <quote>When we reach the panel, I shall stay in the tunnel and await your return. I<ch.apos/>ll only be a burden if I accompany you, and I have no wish to endanger your vital mission. You must enter Skull-Tor alone and make your way up to the surface. Vandyan<ch.apos/>s chambers are located in the inner keep, and from what I<ch.apos/>ve been able to gather, the runes are there also. They are being kept in a hall on the<ch.emdash/></quote></p>
       <p>Hulsta<ch.apos/>s words are suddenly drowned by a deafening noise. The floor shifts violently and you are hurled onto your back as the passageway heaves and shakes. A wide crack appears in the ceiling and you hear Hulsta scream in terror as tons of stone and earth cascade into the tunnel. Helplessly you watch as your companion is buried beneath this deluge of dirt and broken rock.</p>

       <p>Thinking that you are an army scout sent to track them down, the Eldenorans draw their weapons and come racing along the mine shaft in hot pursuit. They are determined to prevent you from getting away. As you reach the entrance to the shaft, you pause to draw your Kai Weapon and land a blow at the base of a ceiling prop. The rotten timber rips in two and several tons of rock cascade into the tunnel. When the dust settles you see that the mine shaft is now sealed off. You allow yourself a wry smile; it will take the Eldenorans more than a day to dig themselves out from their hiding place.</p>
       <p>You leave the collapsed mine entrance and hurry away along the base of the ravine. Night is fast approaching and you have barely covered a mile when the ravine ends abruptly at the edge of a deep gorge. Less than a hundred yards away to the west you can see the outline of a rocky knoll with a slate base that juts out over the rim of this steep, wooded valley. To the east, the gorge cuts a deep furrow through the forest for several miles. There appears to be no easy way of avoiding the gorge, but you are unwilling to attempt a descent in the dark. Instead, you decide to find somewhere safe nearby where you can make camp and await the dawn.</p>

His hands are tied and you suspect he is a prisoner of war.</p>

       <p>The clear night brings with it a sharp frost that sparkles in the starlight, but only a few campfires have been lit. The Vorka have little need of heat, and these fires are solely for the benefit of the humans assigned to command them. You sense that the Eldenorans dislike being in the company of their Vorka troops, and those who are encamped with them harbour a bitter envy of their luckier comrades who are billeted in Tekaro.</p>
       <p>As you are riding past one of the campfires, a disgruntled Eldenoran sergeant looks up from the burning embers and calls out for you to come and join him and his two companions.</p>

       <p>The bitter shock of Hulsta<ch.apos/>s sudden demise hits you like a warhammer in the chest. For several minutes you kneel and stare at his lifeless hand as you struggle to overcome your feelings of grief and remorse. When at last you feel able to continue, you stand up and salute your fallen companion. Then you say a short prayer to the Goddess Ishir to watch over his soul, and you vow to complete your mission in his honour. The swift and successful destruction of the runes will be the best way to ensure that his ultimate sacrifice will never be forgotten.</p>
       <p>With grim resolve you leave the rockfall and follow the tunnel away to the east, but you have covered little more than 100 yards when you come to a dead end. You recall what Hulsta had said earlier, and when you examine the wall closely you discover a secret panel. At waist level a raised lever protrudes from the left wall, but when you attempt to pull it down you find that its ancient mechanism has jammed.</p>

       <p>You steer the boat towards the left bank and feel the keel shudder when it runs aground upon the muddy shore. Another shrill whistle signals to the Vorka and you see them go scurrying back towards the bridge. Using your Kai camouflage skills you are able to slip away from the boat and take cover in the trees unseen. As you lie in the undergrowth, you watch the Vorka cross the bridge and come loping along the river bank towards your boat. Their eyes glow eerily in the moonlit darkness, and the sight of their glinting fangs sends a chill shiver down your spine. Your Kai senses warn you that these ancient predators are excellent hunters and they possess a keen sense of smell.</p>

       <p>Tenaciously you fight to remain in the saddle despite the pain of your injury, and your horse carries you away from the yelling reeves and back to the main street. You draw upon your healing skills to mend your gashed leg as you escape along the street and ride across the square that lies at its end. There are several exits from this square, but you choose the least-busy one to make your escape. This tree-lined avenue bears west towards Tekaro Cathedral. The Eldenorans have turned the city<ch.apos/>s magnificent building into a dormitory for their troops and, as you pass by its grand doors, you glimpse hundreds of soldiers sleeping on the floor of its central nave. Guards posted on the steps regard your blood-spattered breeches with suspicion as your horse plods its way forward. Gently you urge him to increase his pace for fear that they may stop and challenge you.</p>
       <p>At the end of a street flanked by warehouses and guildhalls, you come to the city<ch.apos/>s south gatehouse. A guard casts a cursory glance at you and, upon seeing that you are a scout, he pulls a chain which operates the heavy oak portal. As the gate creaks open you ride through it and out onto the highway beyond. This broad road runs parallel to the shimmering waters of the River Storn and you follow it for a few miles before turning your horse away towards the river. As you approach the rushing waters, you happen upon a derelict hut in the middle of a copse of apple trees picked bare by the invading army. The hut is empty but there is some straw on the ground that will feed your horse, and so you decide to rest here for the few hours that remain before dawn.</p>

       <p>The jovial Slovian helps you to hide the dead Eldenorans in the dense undergrowth. During this task he asks if you are a mercenary from Casiorn. When you tell him that you are a Kai, his jaw drops open with amazement. <quote>A Kai Lord<ch.ellips/>here in Slovia! Ishir be praised. Perhaps we shall win this war after all.</quote> You confide in Rouf that you are on a secret mission and that you must reach the River Storn near Tekaro as soon as you can. He offers to help but he warns you that the city of Tekaro has fallen to the Eldenorans. They occupy the city and have thousands of their Vorka encamped outside its walls. From Tekaro they have been sending reinforcements to their armies fighting across the Slovarian Plain and along the River Suen. This whole region is alive with enemy patrols and it will be difficult for you to avoid them on your way to the Storn. Rouf suggests that you wear one of the dead Eldenoran<ch.apos/>s uniforms, and that he accompany you on the road to Tekaro, posing as your prisoner. His uncle lives in the forest near the River Quarl, a day<ch.apos/>s ride from here, and that is where he wants to go now that he is free.</p>
       <p>You agree to his plan and swap your Kai journeyman clothes for the uniform of a dead Eldenoran scout. (You stow your own kit in your Backpack, which requires space equal to two normal items. If your Backpack is full, you must discard two items to create sufficient space for your Kai Clothes.) Having changed uniform, you mount one of the Eldenoran horses and ride with Rouf back along the forest track heading south towards Tekaro.</p>

       <p>You pull the Phosphor Bomb from your Backpack and hurl it at the Vorka who are swarming up the stairs. It smashes and explodes at their feet, showering the leading half-dozen with hissing white fragments of burning metal and flaming oil. The creatures hit by the blast are thrown back onto those behind them, and they all tumble down the steps in a tangled burning heap. Your deadly weapon has delayed their advance, but it will not stop the waves of armed Vorka that continue to emerge from the distant archway.</p>
       <p>You rush to the head of the stairs and focus your gaze at the rune that is embedded into the side of the bell-chamber. Only by destroying this rune can you stem the Vorka tide. Vandyan is also aware of this and he screams an order to those creatures that are closest to the chamber. In response, they close ranks and use their bodies to form a protective wall in front of the rune.</p>

       <p>You hurry away from the farm and head due north, a course that takes you across open fields and through an old abandoned vineyard. The rain has ceased during the night and the land is now bathed with rays of warm autumn sunlight that filter down through gaps in the clouds. A mile beyond the vineyard you catch sight of a sunken highway, partially hidden by hedgerows. Columns of Eldenoran army wagons are moving along this paved highway in both directions. You magnify your vision and you see that the wagons heading southeast, towards the River Storn, are heavily laden with supplies. The wagons that travel in the opposite direction, towards Duadon, are mostly empty.</p>

At first he does not seem to react to your soporific dirge, but then you notice that he is starting to yawn repeatedly. After a few minutes, he sits down on the steps and cradles his head in his folded arms. You continue your hypnotic chant for a few minutes longer and then, when you are sure that it has had the desired effect, you leave your hiding place and move silently along the corridor. The gaoler is snoring softly when you reach him and you sense that he has fallen into a deep sleep.

Then there is a loud cracking sound and suddenly the crystal chamber collapses in an untidy heap. The rune located above it remains in position. It now hangs suspended in mid-air, but the column of dark mist that inhabited the core of the chamber swirls around the shattered remains like a small tornado. From its centre there comes a hideous shriek and a lance of fear stabs at your heart when suddenly you recall having heard this terrible sound once before.

They are clad in fearsome suits of black armour embellished with skulls and scarlet dragons, and their mounts are similarly protected by plates of burnished steel. They ripple like liquid fire in the light of the setting sun. Alerted by the alarm bell, these riders descend from the hillocks to converge upon the highway and block your path.</p>

       <p><quote>Who are you looking for, trooper?</quote> he barks.</p>
       <p><quote>Er<ch.ellips/>Captain Dvedka,</quote> is your hasty reply. You hold up the map that you took from the herald and add: <quote>I<ch.apos/>ve to deliver this to him, urgently.</quote></p>
       <p>The scribe scoffs at the map. Then, with an arrogant tone, he says: <quote>Dvedka<ch.apos/>s in the Council of War Chamber. It<ch.apos/>s over there.</quote></p>
       <p>With the feather of his quill pen, he points towards the portal to the left of the entrance archway. You thank him for his assistance and then you stride across the hall towards this open door.</p>

       <p>Cautiously you enter the mine shaft and follow the footprints in the dirt of the tunnel floor. You have descended a few hundred yards along the shaft when suddenly you hear the sound of distant voices. When you stop to listen, you quickly determine that they are the voices of three Eldenoran soldiers. From snatches of their furtive conversation you learn that these men are renegades from Vandyan<ch.apos/>s army encamped at Tekaro.</p>

       <p>You take a deep breath before slipping over the side into the cold dark waters of the Quarl. The current helps to speed you along as you swim submerged towards the bridge, and when you are directly beneath its central span, you surface briefly to fill your lungs with air before continuing underwater.</p>
       <p>When you are a few hundred yards beyond the bridge, you surface again and strike out towards the left bank. Your boat has collided with a pillar and the Eldenorans are so preoccupied with recovering it that they fail to see you climb out of the river and escape into the bordering trees. Once you have put more than five miles between yourself and the bridge, you stop to rest for a few hours in the comfortable bough of an oak tree. The night passes without incident and you awaken at dawn to the shrill sound of bird song. Through the thinning canopy of autumn leaves you can see a forest track which runs parallel to the river. A distant flicker of movement catches your eye and, when you magnify your vision, you see three riders approaching from the south. Two are armed and they wear the uniforms of Eldenoran cavalry scouts, but the third is clad in a tunic of scarlet and black<ch.emdash/>the colours of the Slovian army. His hands are tied and you suspect that he is a prisoner of war. The loss of your sailboat threatens to delay your journey downriver to Tekaro by several days. Mindful of this, you decide to ambush the approaching Eldenoran riders and capture their horses.</p>
       <p>From the cover of the trees that border upon the track, you wait until the riders are close and then you draw upon your Magnakai powers of Animal Control to command their mounts to stop. The horses slow to a halt and, despite their riders<ch.apos/> stinging blows, they refuse to take a step further. Silently you unsheathe your Kai Weapon. As soon as the Eldenorans dismount, you leap from your hiding place and take them by surprise.</p>

       <p>The stifling furnace-heat of the workshop hits you like a hammer the moment you walk in. One of the craftsmen motions to you to wait a moment while he puts the finishing touches to a small glass bulb. The shelves are filled with hundreds of similar bulbs, and when you pick one up and examine it, you are shocked to discover it contains a volatile mixture of naphtha and phosphorus. The glassblowers are manufacturing phosphorus bombs for Vandyan<ch.apos/>s army, and stacked upon their shelves are enough of these deadly incendiaries to raze a small town. (If you wish to take a Phosphor Bomb, record it on your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a> as a Backpack Item.)</p>
       <p>Unsettled by what you have discovered here, you decide not to wait for the glassblower to finish his work. Instead, you hurry out of the workshop and return to the street.</p>

       <p>You cut through the wall of Vorka and strike the rune with devastating effect. There is a tremendous explosion and a splash of fiery green sparks erupts as your blade cleaves the evil stone in two. Then the bell-chamber is swallowed up by sheets of orange flame and you are thrown backwards to the floor as shards of broken stone whistle around you. When the rain of debris ceases, you pull yourself to your feet and look upon the devastated remains of the bell-chamber. Pools of fire burn among the shards that litter the floor of the pit, and all the Vorka that were spawned in its core now lie twisted and lifeless among the flaming ruins. The sight of this burning devastation is shocking to behold, yet you feel elated when you sense that the breaking of the rune has, at a single stroke, destroyed every Vorka that has ever emerged from the spawning chamber.</p>

You close your eyes and force yourself to concentrate, and slowly a host of terrible images takes shape in your mind<ch.apos/>s eye. Beneath the soil of this clearing lie the bodies of a thousand Slovian prisoners of war. Captured when Tekaro fell, they were brought here by Eldenoran guards and murdered by the merciless Vorka. This clearing is the site of their mass grave and you can detect a strong psychic presence. Mostly it comprises a lingering residue formed by the souls of the innocent men who were murdered here, but there is also something else<ch.emdash/>something invisible yet wholly evil.</p>

       <p>Over the course of the next hour, the traffic gradually decreases until the highway is empty of enemy wagons. At this time you approach the road and follow it towards the northwest. By noon, having covered more than 10 miles, you stop to gather a meal of wild berries that are growing along the banks of a stream. While you are eating, two riders approach you from the north. You magnify your vision and see that they are Eldenoran scouts; they are clad in uniforms similar to the one you are wearing. Immediately you look around for a place to hide until they have passed, but when you notice that they are now galloping directly towards you, clearly it is too late to hide: you have already been seen.

       <p>From the battlements of Skull-Tor there arises a shrieking wail. At first this terrible sound reminds you of the ghastly howl emitted by the Vaag when they were consumed by the raging storm, but then you look to the fortress and quickly you determine that this is no supernatural sound: it is an alarm siren. Shortly after the shriek of this alarm is heard, you see the portcullis rise at Skull-Tor<ch.apos/>s North Gate. A troop of cavalry gallops forth, and you note that each trooper is carrying a burning torch in one hand and a Bor pistol in the other. Fear returns to chill your blood when you sense that you have been spotted from the battlements, and this troop of cavalry has been dispatched to ride you down.</p>
       <p>You break into a run and race along the paved avenue towards the western flank of Cillan Square. As you near the corner you see the saddle-maker<ch.apos/>s shop where you and Hulsta first gained entry to the tunnel below Skull-Tor. You are sprinting across the avenue towards an alleyway that runs alongside the shop when the cavalry comes bearing down on you from behind. The captain screams an order to his men to open fire and the thunderous report of their pistols explodes in your ears.</p>

       <p>Hurriedly you draw upon your advanced Kai Discipline to conjure up a mist that engulfs both you and your mount. The Eldenorans are startled by the billowing vapours and they back away in confusion, giving you space in which to turn your horse about and gallop away into a nearby alley. As you race along this deserted passageway, you glance over your shoulder and see that the mist has now dissipated and the reeves are pursuing you. The alley turns to the right and comes to a dead end. Facing you is a three-storey townhouse with a balcony which overhangs a pair of stable doors. The lock is broken and so you pull open a door and urge your horse to enter the gloomy interior. Quickly you dismount in the darkness and wedge the doors shut with the shaft of a hammer you find discarded upon the straw-covered ground. Moments later you hear the echoing footfalls of the reeves as they come running around the corner. Their sergeant orders them to check the entrance of every house bordering the <foreign xml:lang="fr">cul-de-sac</foreign>. Two soldiers approach and the stable doors rattle when they push against them with the butts of their spears. You wait with bated breath, fearing they will try to force them open, but they are satisfied that the doors must be bolted from the inside and they move on to check the next house. After a few minutes you hear the soldiers leaving the square. Then a yellowy light flares up behind you, and you spin around to see an old woman standing in a doorway at the top of a short flight of stone steps. She is holding a lantern in one hand and a carving knife in the other.</p>

       <p><quote>Very well, I<ch.apos/>ll pay what you ask,</quote> you reply. The guards order the following riders and wagons to wait while they lower the portcullis and escort you away to the gatehouse. You are beginning to think that they intend to renege on the deal and throw you into a cell regardless, but the taller guard soon eases your fears. Quietly he says to you: <quote>Don<ch.apos/>t worry, trooper. We<ch.apos/>ll jus<ch.apos/> go somewhere private. We don<ch.apos/>t want all o<ch.apos/> Duadon witnessing our business.</quote></p>
       <p>You accompany the guards into the gatehouse and along a corridor to an empty chamber where a small door is set into the wall. Here you hand over the 10 Gold Crowns (erase these from your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>) and the guards unlock the door. It opens on to a quiet alleyway overshadowed by the city<ch.apos/>s south wall. <quote>Off y<ch.apos/>go, trooper,</quote> says the tall guard, and he pushes you through the arched doorway.</p>
       <p>The door shuts behind you with a dull thud and you hear a key turning in the lock. You leave the door and walk along the narrow alleyway towards the gatehouse arch. From the shadows, you observe the flagstoned square at the approach to the South Gate and note that the portcullis is raised and the flow of traffic has resumed. Wagons trundle across the square and enter a wide avenue called Bannerway, which leads to Vandyan<ch.apos/>s stronghold of Skull-Tor at the centre of the city.</p>
       <p>You recall Gwynian<ch.apos/>s briefing that the agents you must contact can be found in Flank Street, in the city<ch.apos/>s Northern Quarter. You are presently in the Southern Quarter of Duadon and so you enter the square and follow the line of wagons that is heading towards Skull-Tor. You are hoping that this avenue will be the quickest way to reach the Northern Quarter, but unfortunately you soon discover that Bannerway has been reserved for the use of supply wagons only. Armed guardsmen control access to the avenue and they turn you away as you attempt to enter on foot. Undeterred, you resolve to find another route across Duadon to the Northern Quarter. Looking around the soot-blackened buildings, you see two other roads that lead off from the South Gate square, to the east and west. The west road is called Knucklebone Lane and the east road is called Kettle Street.</p>

       <p>Dusk is fast becoming darkness. You have barely covered a mile of the shallow ravine when it ends abruptly at the edge of a deep gorge. Less than a hundred yards away to the west, you can see a rocky knoll with a slate base that juts out over the rim of this steep valley. To the east, the gorge cuts a deep furrow through the forest for several miles. There appears to be no easy way of avoiding the gorge, but you are far from keen to attempt a descent in the dark. Instead, you decide to find somewhere safe nearby where you can set up camp and wait for the dawn.</p>

       <p>You are four days out of Casiorn when, shortly after noon, the column reaches the outskirts of Quarlen. Many of the mercenary regiments of Anari, Firalond, and Kakush are encamped around its fortified wall and they give a rousing cheer when your banner is first sighted by their lookouts. Proudly Lone Wolf acknowledges their salutes as he leads the Kai through the town<ch.apos/>s East Gate and along a wide street which descends towards the River Quarl. The column is signalled to halt when it comes to a large square, and quietly you await Lone Wolf<ch.apos/>s order to dismount. This square is located close to the eastern approach to a wide stone bridge that no longer crosses the river, its central span having been destroyed to prevent the enemy from using it. Three Anarian officers arrive on foot and request that Lone Wolf and Gwynian accompany them to a nearby tavern where the mercenary commander, Lord Nathuro, has set up his headquarters. Lone Wolf agrees to their request, but before he goes he orders that you and your fellow Grand Masters secure good stabling and billets for the Kai in the buildings which border upon this square.</p>
       <p>Within the hour, you have carried out Lone Wolf<ch.apos/>s orders in full. Your own billet consists of a room above a tailor<ch.apos/>s shop that you share with Bright Star, a friend and fellow Grand Master. You are preparing a meal when a messenger arrives with an order from Lone Wolf for all Grand Masters to join him at once at the Barrel Bridge Tavern<ch.emdash/>Lord Nathuro<ch.apos/>s headquarters.</p>
       <p>Upon entering the tavern<ch.apos/>s spacious taproom, Lone Wolf immediately introduces you and your comrades to Lord Nathuro and his captains. A Council of War has already taken place and Lone Wolf has settled with Nathuro which of his regiments the Kai are to command. He hands lists of these units to Bright Star and the other Grand Masters, and then he orders them to go and inform the Kai of their command postings. You are wondering why you have not been handed one of these lists as you get ready to leave the tavern, but as you turn to go, Lone Wolf orders you to remain. Soon you discover why it is that you have not been allocated a regimental command.</p>

       <p>You retrieve the keys from your tunic pocket and immediately your Sixth Sense identifies the one that will open this door. You twist the key in the lock and pull open the heavy portal to discover an unguarded antechamber which leads to an echoing hall. Along the left wall of this windswept hallway are tall arched windows that command a view of the parade ground surrounding the inner keep of Skull-Tor.</p>
       <p>You recall Hulsta speaking about this keep shortly before his untimely death and, when you focus your Kai senses upon its imposing walls, you detect that it harbours the evil power that you have come to destroy. From the cover of the antechamber, you observe the keep and determine that entry to it can only be gained via a drawbridge which gives access to an archway located some 20 feet above the ground. To reach this bridge, you will have to ascend to the next level of Skull-Tor. This will not be an easy task, for the hallway and the parade ground are swarming with Eldenoran officers and Vorka slaves.</p>

       <p>Using the cover of the trees, you skirt around the stone bridge and then follow the river southwards. Once you have put more than five miles between yourself and the Eldenorans, you stop to sleep for a few hours in the comfortable bough of an oak tree. The night passes without incident and you awaken at dawn to the shrill sound of bird song. Through the thinning canopy of autumn leaves you can see a forest track which runs parallel to the river. A distant flicker of movement catches your eye and, when you magnify your vision, you see three riders approaching from the south. Two are armed and they wear the uniforms of Eldenoran cavalry scouts, but the third is clad in a tunic of scarlet and black<ch.emdash/>the colours of the Slovian army. His hands are tied and you suspect that he is a prisoner of war. The loss of your sailboat threatens to delay your journey downriver to Tekaro by several days. Mindful of this, you decide to set an ambush for the approaching Eldenoran riders to capture their horses.</p>
       <p>From the cover of the trees that border upon the track, you wait until the riders are close and then you draw upon your Magnakai powers of Animal Control to command their horses to stop. They slow to a halt and, despite their riders<ch.apos/> stinging blows, they refuse to take a step further. Silently you unsheathe your Kai Weapon. As soon as the Eldenorans dismount, you leap from your hiding place and take them by surprise.</p>

       <p>The guards glance at your wristband and nod their approval. They part their crossed spears and allow you to march out across the drawbridge, towards the open archway of the inner keep. As you reach the middle of the bridge, you look to your right and see plumes of black smoke rising up into the night sky. They originate from the chimneys of armouries located on the east side of Skull-Tor. Even at this late hour they are in full production, manufacturing an unending supply of weapons and armour for Vandyan<ch.apos/>s Vorka hordes.</p>
       <p>Upon entering the archway, you find yourself standing in a circular hall that is hung with tapestries and framed portraits. At a desk positioned in the middle of this hall sits an Eldenoran scribe who is busily writing in a ledger with a quill pen. He is so engrossed with his work that he does not acknowledge your presence in any way. Behind him you see a flight of stairs spiralling up to the floor above, and on either side of the entrance archway there are open portals which lead off to the left and right.</p>

       <p>Quickly you locate the grating and Hulsta uses his dagger to dig out the grime that cements it in place. Once it is cleared, together you lift the grating away and peer down at the river flowing below. Hulsta is anxious about the depth of the water and so he ties a chunk of brick to the end of his rope and lowers it into the flow. When he withdraws it you are both relieved to see that the water here is little more than waist-deep. You are the first to enter the river, and then you take hold of the lantern to allow Hulsta to drop down behind you. Your Magnakai Discipline of Nexus protects you from the water<ch.apos/>s icy chill, but Hulsta is not so fortunate. He gasps with shock when he enters the water and you realize that he will not be able to tolerate its freezing temperature for more than a few minutes at most.</p>
       <p>Mindful of your companion<ch.apos/>s discomfort, you hand him back the lantern and then lead the way along this circular channel. You are peering at the rough-hewn ceiling, seeking out the next grating, when suddenly you feel something brush against your thigh. You glimpse a trail of bubbles and instinctively you pull away, tugging your weapon from its scabbard as you recoil. Moments later, the scaly head of a large black serpent breaks through the surface and rears up before your face. Its venomous fangs glint in the lantern-light and its forked crimson tongue flickers wildly, sensing prey. Hulsta cries out in alarm as the great black snake jerks back its head and narrows its ghoulish green eyes. It is getting ready to strike.</p>

       <p>You recite the words of the spell and launch a bolt of energy that strikes the rune with devastating effect. There is a loud <onomatopoeia>Crack!</onomatopoeia> and a splash of fiery green sparks erupts as the evil stone is sundered in two. Moments later, the crystal chamber is torn apart and a terrible shriek assails your ears as the air is filled with hissing bolts of fire. Instinctively you turn away from the explosion and cover your head with your left arm as shards of broken crystal cascade around you, like a rain of deadly daggers. When this deluge ceases, you turn back and look with fearful expectation upon the devastated remains of the chamber. Flickering trails of green fire sputter and die among the scattered crystal shards, and the column of dark mist that inhabited its core now swirls around the debris like a small tornado. From its core there comes a hideous shriek and a lance of cold fear stabs at your heart when suddenly you recall having heard this terrible sound once before. This dark shadow is Zorkaan the Soultaker, the entity that you encountered at the clearing in the Grochod Forest, the evil presence that you disturbed as it fed upon the psychic remains of the innocent Slovian prisoners slain and buried there. The whirling shadow of Zorkaan gathers speed and, with a parting wail, it shoots upwards and disappears through the aperture in the hall<ch.apos/>s domed ceiling, into the very eye of the raging storm.</p>
       <p>The noise of the exploding bell-chamber and the hellish shriek of Zorkaan alerts Vandyan to your presence in the hall below. You see his face twisted with rage. He raises a glowing silver disc that is clasped tightly in the palm of his right hand, and then he spits out a vile curse that chills your blood.</p>

       <p>Tenaciously you fight to remain in the saddle despite the pain of your injury, and your horse carries you away from the yelling reeves and back to the main street. You draw upon your healing skills to mend your wound as you escape along the street and ride across the square that lies at its end. There are several exits from this square, but you choose the least-busy one to make your escape. This tree-lined avenue bears west towards Tekaro Cathedral. The Eldenorans have turned the city<ch.apos/>s magnificent building into a dormitory for their troops, and as you pass by its grand doors, you glimpse hundreds of soldiers sleeping on the floor of its central nave. Guards posted on the steps regard your blood-spattered clothing with suspicion as your horse plods its way forward. Gently you urge him to increase his pace for fear that they may stop and challenge you.</p>
       <p>At the end of a street flanked by warehouses and guildhalls, you come to the city<ch.apos/>s south gatehouse. A guard casts a cursory glance at you and, upon seeing that you are a scout, he pulls a chain which operates the heavy oak portal. As the gate creaks open you ride through it and out onto the highway beyond. This broad road runs parallel to the shimmering waters of the River Storn and you follow it for a few miles before turning your horse away towards the river. As you approach the rushing waters, you happen upon a derelict hut in the middle of a copse of apple trees picked bare by the invading army. The hut is empty but there is some straw on the ground that will feed your horse, and so you decide to rest here for the few hours that remain before dawn.</p>

       <p>Shortly you come to a highway that runs parallel to the Storn. You cross over this road and descend a bracken-covered slope towards the river<ch.apos/>s east bank. As you approach the rushing waters, you happen upon a derelict hut in the middle of a copse of apple trees picked bare by the invading army. The hut is empty but there is some straw on the ground that will feed your horse, and so you decide to rest here for the few hours that remain before dawn.</p>

       <p>The moment you turn the third dial to its correct setting,<footref id="sect221-1" idref="sect221-1-foot"/> the great black door swings silently open to reveal a magnificent marble chamber, lit by a glowing orb which hangs suspended in mid-air. The walls are covered with battle scenes, recently engraved, which depict the victories of Vandyan<ch.apos/>s Vorka hordes against the Freeland armies of the Stornlands. On a table at the far end of the chamber you discover a wooden rack which contains three stoppered vials. In each of these glass tubes there is a coloured, jelly-like liquid: one red, one yellow, and one blue.</p>

       <p>You run along a wide, low-ceilinged tunnel that is strewn with the corpses of Vorka, all of whom perished the moment you destroyed the rune which empowered their existence. The tunnel enters an armoury where furnaces now blaze unattended, and ends at a ramp that ascends to an open gate. Through this gate you glimpse the starry night sky and the rooftops of Duadon<ch.apos/>s East Quarter. This is a welcome sight for it holds the promise of escape from Skull-Tor. As you reach the ramp you increase your pace and run swiftly towards the gate but, as you are nearing the top, your path is blocked by a hulking, blue-skinned giant. At once you recognize this creature to be an Ogron, a notoriously dull-witted breed but one much suited to hard labour. The Ogron who faces you now is an armourer and he is carrying a heavy double-handed warhammer. You order him to let you pass, but your command is angrily countermanded by Vandyan<ch.apos/>s guards who have entered the tunnel behind you. They order the Ogron to attack you, and readily he raises his great warhammer and takes a swipe at your head.</p>

       <p>Delissa has already prepared the route by which you can escape from Duadon. One of the ancient tunnels of Skull-Tor passes directly below the city<ch.apos/>s North Gate and it emerges in the middle of a coppice less than a mile from the city wall. She and Hulsta found a way to enter this tunnel through the cellar of a warehouse located less than half a mile from the cooperage. Hulsta scouted the tunnel before you arrived in the city, but Delissa is anxious to ensure that the way is still clear now that Vandyan<ch.apos/>s troops are out hunting for you.</p>
       <p>Shortly after dawn, she leaves the cooperage to scout the surrounding streets. When she returns an hour later, you sense that she is anxious and disappointed.</p>
       <p><quote>Vandyan<ch.apos/>s men have discovered the tunnel,</quote> she says, despondently. <quote>They have sealed it off and posted guards around the building. The watch on the battlements and at the city gates has been trebled, and a reward has been placed on your head.</quote> She takes a scroll from her pocket and gives it to you. When you unfurl it you see your own face depicted upon the parchment. Below is printed the sum of 10,000 Gold Crowns, and the words: <quote>For delivery of this man<ch.apos/>s body to Skull-Tor. Dead or Alive</quote>.</p>
       <p><quote>They are posted on every street corner,</quote> she says, shaking her head. <quote>It is not safe for you to leave the cooperage<ch.emdash/>everyone is looking for you. Duadon is awash with rumour. The Vorka have perished and the Eldenoran army is in retreat. The citizens fear retribution at the hands of those who were overrun by Vandyan<ch.apos/>s horde, and as for Vandyan himself, they say he has gone mad with rage. He has ordered his most feared troops<ch.emdash/>the Sinistrari<ch.emdash/>to return to Duadon at once to lead the hunt for you. They are riding from Luyen and will arrive tomorrow.</quote></p>
       <p>Delissa insists that you remain hidden in the parlour over the next two days. She hopes that Vandyan may begin to believe that you fled Duadon immediately after your escape from Skull-Tor, and that you are no longer to be found in the city. Her reasoning seems to be borne out by a reduction in the number of guards she sees patrolling the streets at the end of the second day. But when the third day arrives, you can no longer afford to lie low and wait for Vandyan to release his iron grip upon this city. You must reach Xaitar<ch.apos/>s Rock before nightfall in order to rendezvous with Guildmaster Banedon.</p>
       <p>Now that the tunnel can no longer be used, you formulate a new plan to escape from Duadon by way of the city<ch.apos/>s North Gate. Delissa prepares a disguise for you, using theatrical make-up and a wig, and she also creates a convincing story to explain your departure from the city. You are to play the role of her cousin, and the two of you will be leaving Duadon bound for Luyen in order to tend to Delissa<ch.apos/>s sister who has suddenly been taken ill. It is a bold plan, and as the hour of your departure draws closer, you offer up a prayer to Goddess Ishir in the hope that she will grant it her blessing. (Having rested for three days, you may now restore 9 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points to your current total.)</p>

       <p>When the other Grand Masters have left the taproom, Lone Wolf tells you of an important mission that he and Gwynian want you to undertake. Agents in the Eldenoran capital of Duadon have confirmed that the Runes of Agarash are being kept in the city<ch.apos/>s stronghold, a daunting fortress called Skull-Tor. Lone Wolf wants you to travel alone to Duadon and make contact with Gwynian<ch.apos/>s agents. They know a secret route into the fortress and they will help you to gain entry. Once inside, you must find and destroy the runes as quickly as you are able. Upon completion of this task, the agents will assist you to escape from Duadon and will take you to a place of safety.</p>
       <p><quote>This is a very dangerous mission, Grand Master,</quote> says Lone Wolf gravely, <quote>yet it must be undertaken and it must be completed successfully if we are to rid the Stornlands of Vandyan and his foul Vorka hordes. It is the only key we have to a lasting victory. You have proved yourself to be brave and resourceful these past few months and I would not think ill of you if you were to decline this mission. But of all the Kai, I know that only you possess the inner strength and resolve to fulfil this vital task. Grand Master, will you accept the mission?</quote></p>
       <p>The thought of venturing hundreds of miles behind enemy lines to undertake such a dangerous quest fills you with a sense of dread. Yet you feel greatly honoured to have been chosen for this mission and you do not flinch from your duty. <quote>I accept, my lord,</quote> you reply firmly.</p>
       <p>Gwynian, Nathuro, and the assembled mercenary captains all breathe a collective sigh of relief upon hearing your response. Lone Wolf smiles and nods his head. <quote>So be it, Grand Master. The road ahead is sure to be a difficult one, but I am confident you shall prevail.</quote></p>
       <p>Lord Nathuro and his officers salute you and bid you good luck, and then they leave the tavern and assist with the transfer of their regiments to Kai command. Lone Wolf and Gwynian bid you accompany them to an adjoining chamber where you are given further information about the mission. With the help of a <a idref="map">map of the Stornlands</a>, Gwynian shows you that the quickest route to Duadon is by way of the River Quarl. You are to travel downriver by boat to a place beyond the city of Tekaro where the Quarl flows into the great River Storn. Here, preferably at night, you must cross to the west bank of the Storn, abandon your boat, and then enter the Grochod Forest on foot. This is Eldenoran territory and Lone Wolf warns you that any persons or creatures that you encounter in Grochod Forest will most likely be hostile. Under cover of the trees, you are to trek north through the timberlands until you reach the southern approaches to Duadon itself. The city gate is likely to be guarded well, but you must enter without being seen.</p>
       <p><quote>Once inside Duadon,</quote> says Gwynian, <quote>make your way to Flank Street. It is in the Northern Quarter. There you will find a cooperage, a barrel-maker<ch.apos/>s shop, which is run by a man called Hulsta and his wife, Delissa. They are my agents and they are loyal to our cause. They are awaiting the arrival of a Kai and you may make yourself known to them by using the words: <quote>A barrel made from Sommlending oak</quote>. Be sure to use these exact words for they will respond to no others. Hulsta will show you how to enter Skull-Tor where you must locate and destroy the runes and escape as quickly as you are able. If you are successful, we shall know of it immediately. By breaking the runes you will extinguish the source of the power by which the Vorka are permitted to exist. When Vandyan<ch.apos/>s fell army dissolves, we shall be able to raise the siege of Varetta and defeat any Eldenoran who dares remain upon Lyrisian soil.</quote></p>

       <p>You thank the owner for his time, and then you hurry out of the emporium and continue on your way. When you reach the end of Knucklebone Lane, you turn right into Flank Wall. The signpost bearing its name is topped by a brass badge shaped in the likeness of a setting sun, indicating that you are now entering Duadon<ch.apos/>s West Quarter. You walk along Flank Wall, past the workshops of hatters, lamp-makers, and potters, until you come to a flagstoned square in the shadow of the city<ch.apos/>s West Gate. An unending stream of wagons, each piled high with timber and iron ore, is pouring into the city through this gateway. They trundle across the square and along a wide thoroughfare called Corvayl Avenue which leads directly to Skull-Tor. You stop to look along this busy street and, through a hazy curtain of acrid smoke, you catch your first glimpse of the imposing arched entrance to Vandyan<ch.apos/>s stronghold. It resembles the toothed and fleshless jaw of a huge shark.</p>
       <p>Mindful of the emporium owner<ch.apos/>s words, you resolve to avoid Skull-Tor and continue along Flank Wall. Yet in order to do so you must negotiate the heavy traffic that is trundling across the West Gate square.</p>

       <p>You chase after the Eldenoran but you are unable to prevent him from getting away. As he gallops off into the darkness, you hope that he is too scared to return this night. When you return to the cabin you find Rouf being hugged by his uncle and aunt who are overcome with emotion to see their favourite nephew once more. Quickly Rouf explains that, despite your uniform, you are not an Eldenoran. When he then goes on to reveal that you are a Kai Lord on a secret mission, their eyes widen with awe. Prizo warns you that there are many Eldenorans in this area and that it is no longer a safe place. He invites you both to stay here this night but he says you must remain watchful. Reluctantly Prizo and his wife have decided to leave their home. They plan to cross the Quarl and seek shelter in Salony. Many Slovian refugees, including other members of Rouf<ch.apos/>s family, have found sanctuary there in the Great Forest and they plan to join them.</p>
       <p>You and Rouf take turns to keep watch during the night, and shortly before dawn you awaken his uncle and aunt. Fie prepares a delicious breakfast and while you are eating they discuss their plans. Rouf has decided to join his aunt and uncle and go with them to Salony. You tell them that you must continue with your mission and try to cross the River Storn near Tekaro. Prizo repeats Rouf<ch.apos/>s warning that the city is occupied by the Eldenorans and encircled by Vorka regiments, but he also has some extra information that might be useful. He says that the Eldenorans have set up a military ferry on the Storn, five miles south of the confluence where the two rivers, the Quarl and the Storn, meet. In your disguise as an Eldenoran scout, you may find it is the easiest way to cross the river.</p>
       <p>After breakfast, you thank Rouf and his kin for their help and you wish them luck on their journey to Salony. In return they thank you for freeing them and Fie offers you some food for the road ahead (enough for 2 Meals). Then they bid you farewell and wave goodbye from the doorway as you leave the cabin and go to retrieve your horse.</p>

       <p>You walk up Flank Avenue, past the establishments of moneylenders, wagoneers, and rope-makers until you come to a flagstoned square before the city<ch.apos/>s East Gate. A column of scaly-skinned Vorka are marching across the square and out through the gate, accompanied by young fresh-faced Eldenoran officers on horseback. You stop to watch the Vorka and, when you look back along their ranks, you see a busy street which leads to the centre of the city. Lurking behind a hazy curtain of acrid grey smoke is the fortress of Skull-Tor, less than half a mile distant. It is from here that the Vorka are emerging. Like some foul discharge, they flow forth in green streams from the newly-constructed armouries that adjoin Vandyan<ch.apos/>s grim stronghold.</p>
       <p>You resolve to avoid Skull-Tor and continue along Flank Avenue in the hope that it may lead directly to Flank Street. When a gap appears between the marching ranks, you hurry across the square and press on towards the north of the city. Soon you come to a watchtower in the northeast corner of Duadon. Your spirits rise when you see a signpost surmounted by a silver star, for it indicates that you are about to enter the Northern Quarter. But when you read the name engraved below the star you are disappointed to find that it says: North Watch Lane.</p>

Gently you urge him to increase his pace for fear that they may stop and challenge you.</p>
       <p>At the end of a street flanked by warehouses and guildhalls you come to the city<ch.apos/>s south gatehouse. A guard casts a cursory glance at your horse and uniform and, upon seeing that you are a scout, he pulls a chain which operates the heavy oak portal. The gate creaks open and quickly you ride through it and out onto a highway beyond. This broad road runs parallel to the River Storn and you follow it for five miles before you come to a wide cinder track, newly-laid by Eldenoran engineers to service their military ferry across the great river. You recall Rouf<ch.apos/>s uncle telling you about the ferry and you decide to take a closer look. You steer your horse onto the cinder track and descend towards a large raft which is moored at the river. There are six Eldenoran guards on duty here, but none pay you too much attention. They all appear to be nursing hangovers this morning and none feel inclined to talk. You ride onto the raft and remain in the saddle as the flat-bottomed ferry is winched by rope and pulley across the Storn. As soon as it comes to a halt, you ride your horse up a wooden ramp and onto a road that has been cleared and levelled by the Eldenoran army through this part of the Grochod Forest. Once clear and beyond sight of the ferry, you leave this military road and enter the trees. The forest is too dense for you to traverse it on horseback and so you abandon your mount and continue on foot.</p>

       <p>A piece of rock smashes into the planking near your feet. It tears a hole in the bottom of the boat and a spout of water gushes into the air to rain down upon your head. You are attempting to plug this leak with a knot of canvas when an arrow clips your shoulder and knocks you down: lose 2 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points.</p>
       <p>The Eldenorans cheer as your boat begins to founder. As it disappears from view beneath the centre arch, you hear their echoing footfalls as they rush across to the opposite side of the bridge to wait for it to reappear. When you emerge, the Eldenorans laugh and jeer. The water is rushing in so fast now that you decide you must abandon the boat. You turn the rudder towards the left bank and aim your sinking craft at a place where a copse of willow trees overhangs the river. As you pass beneath the branches, you clamber out and quickly take cover among the trees.</p>
       <p>The Eldenorans soon arrive to search the boat and the surrounding area. They fail to discover you and silently you observe them from the undergrowth as they drag your half-submerged boat out of the water and sift through its meagre contents. When they tire of this, they return to their duties at the bridge. Once the coast is clear, you leave the copse and hurry away. Only when you have put more than five miles between yourself and the Eldenorans do you dare stop to rest for a few hours in the bough of an oak tree.</p>

       <p>You pull away from the Vorka and retreat towards the stairs. As you move, you unshoulder your Bow and draw an Arrow to your lips. For a few fleeting seconds you see the rune clearly, and this is all you need in order to be able to let loose your shaft with accuracy. The Arrow strikes the rune with devastating effect. There is a tremendous explosion and a splash of fiery green sparks erupts as it cleaves the evil stone in two. Instantly the bell-chamber is swallowed up by sheets of orange flame and you are blown back against the wall of the pit. Shards of broken stone whistle around you. When the rain of debris ceases, you pull yourself to your feet and look upon the devastated remains of the bell-chamber. Pools of fire burn among the splinters that litter the floor, and all the Vorka that were spawned in its core now lie twisted and lifeless among the flaming ruins. The sight of this burning devastation is shocking to behold, yet you feel elated when you sense that the breaking of the rune has, at a single stroke, destroyed every Vorka that has ever emerged from the spawning chamber.</p>

       <p>You are nearing the northern perimeter of the forest when you stop for a few minutes to catch your breath. You look back towards the clearing, now more than a mile distant, and for a few fleeting moments your head is filled with screams of pain and the plaintive cries of innocent men begging for their lives to be spared. These terrible sounds drive cold spikes of despair deep into your heart, but your Kai senses swiftly override these feelings of hopelessness and suddenly you realize that the sounds are not real. They are a cruel illusion, an aural hallucination planted in your mind by the evil shadow-creature.</p>
       <p>Fearful of its sinister powers, you hurry away through the trees. Soon you emerge from the Grochod Forest upon a grassy ridge and see before you a patchwork of ploughed and fallow fields stretching to the far horizon. You recognize this land to be the Demera Quilt, the cultivated farmlands and vineries south of Duadon. The cloudy sky is darkening as night approaches yet, when you magnify your vision, you are still able to catch a glimpse of Duadon itself. This grim city lies 30 miles away, towards the northwest.</p>
       <p>As night draws closer, a cold wind arises and the heavy rains of the past few days return once more. Chilled by the weather and by your encounter at the clearing, you scan the landscape in search of somewhere dry to spend this night.

       <p>As you strike the telling blow, Zorkaan emits a hideous shriek. The shadowy creature begins to shimmer and whirl like a raging cyclone, rising and fading in intensity. Then, with a last mournful wail, it shoots upwards and disappears through the aperture in the hall<ch.apos/>s domed ceiling, into the very eye of the storm that rages overhead. You raise your Kai Weapon once more and run towards the rune that hangs suspended in the air, above the shattered remains of the crystal bell-chamber. With cat-like grace you spring into the air and strike the black stone a single devastating blow. There is a loud explosion and a splash of fiery green sparks erupts when your blade cleaves the evil stone in two.</p>
       <p>Vandyan is shocked to witness the defeat of Zorkaan and the destruction of his Vorka horde. But the storm is reaching its peak above Skull-Tor, and soon he will summon the Vaag to enact his revenge upon you. He cackles with mad glee as he raises into position the crystal saucer which contains the last remaining rune. Bolts of lightning are striking at the very edge of the aperture now; it is only a matter of minutes before the Vaag will be released. Desperate to prevent this calamity, you rush across the hall to an iron ladder that is bolted to the obsidian wall. It ascends to the edge of Vandyan<ch.apos/>s raised platform. As you climb towards the storm-lit platform, you pray to Kai to give you strength enough to defeat this wicked foe.</p>

Gradually you increase your pace as you draw closer and, with cat-like grace, you spring into the air and strike the black stone a single devastating blow. There is a loud explosion and a splash of fiery green sparks erupts when your blade cleaves the evil stone in two. As your feet return to the ground, you hear the thundering crash of fragmenting crystal. Suddenly the air is filled with crackling bolts of green fire and a terrible shriek assails your ears. Instinctively you roll away from the collapsing chamber and cover your head with your left arm as shards of broken crystal cascade around you, like a rain of deadly daggers. When the deluge ceases, you raise your head and look with fearful expectation at the devastated remains of the chamber. Flickering trails of green fire sputter and die among the heaped crystal shards, and the column of dark mist that inhabited its core now swirls around the remains like a small tornado. From its core there comes a hideous shriek and a lance of cold fear stabs at your heart when suddenly you recall having heard this terrible sound once before. This dark shadow is Zorkaan the Soultaker, the entity that you encountered at the clearing in the Grochod Forest, the evil presence that you disturbed as it fed upon the psychic remains of the innocent Slovian prisoners slain and buried there. The whirling shadow of Zorkaan gathers speed and, with a parting wail, it shoots upwards and disappears through the aperture in the hall<ch.apos/>s domed ceiling, into the very eye of the raging storm.</p>

       <p>You wait until a gap appears and then you rush forward and dash between the trundling supply wagons. The driver of an oncoming wagon lashes his horses with his whip in a deliberate attempt to run you down. But the swiftness of your reactions saves you from being trampled and you reach the far side unscathed.</p>
       <p>The driver brandishes his whip and yells that he will report you to the reeves at Skull-Tor. Rather than run the risk of being arrested, you melt away quickly into the crowded street that lies beyond the West Gate square.</p>

       <p>With a gurgling death-cry, the Vorka tumbles out of the boat and splashes into the dark waters. For an instant you glimpse the curve of its back, and then its body is caught by the current and dragged below the surface.</p>
       <p>You sheathe your Weapon and cover yourself once more with the canvas to avoid being seen when your craft emerges from beneath the bridge. The sailboat is carried swiftly away in the grip of the river<ch.apos/>s powerful current, and soon the gruff sound of the Eldenorans can no longer be heard. Within the hour you arrive at a point where the river meanders into a hilly, timbered region. It is difficult to navigate this section of the river in the dark and so you decide to stop and rest until daybreak. You beach your boat on the left bank and settle down to sleep under the bough of an oak tree.</p>
       <p>Before you go to sleep, unless you possess the Discipline of Grand Huntmastery, you must eat a Meal or lose 3 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points.</p>

       <p>This litter-strewn street leads to a circular watchtower located at the place where Duadon<ch.apos/>s south and west city walls meet.

       <p>You draw upon your Discipline of Animal Mastery to subdue the dog, and the effect of your suggestion is immediate and irresistible. The dog stops growling and comes bounding towards you like a carefree puppy. You pat and stroke him, and he licks your hand affectionately.</p>
       <p><quote>Well I<ch.apos/>ll be!</quote> exclaims one of the guardsmen. <quote>You certainly <ch.apos/>ave a way with dogs. Ol<ch.apos/> Bloodfang don<ch.apos/>t normally take to strangers.</quote></p>

       <p>Your control over the dog greatly impresses the two soldiers and they choose to forget about searching the parlour and its adjoining rooms. After a few minutes they put their dog on a leash and then they return to the yard. You stand in the doorway and watch as they, and four other guardsmen, make a thorough search of the barrels stored along the rear wall.</p>

       <p>The guards appear satisfied with your account and they call off their search. They bid you both goodnight and leave by the rear gate. When she is sure they have gone, Delissa quickly returns to the parlour and locks the door behind her.</p>

       <p>You wait until you can count no more than a dozen Eldenorans. Then you leave the antechamber and march boldly along the hallway towards a grand staircase which ascends to the next level of the fortress. Keeping your head bowed to avoid eye contact with passing enemy officers, you reach the stairs and hurry up them to a landing on the floor above. As you approach this landing you see the entrance to the drawbridge away to your right. It is lit by lanterns and is guarded by two Eldenoran warriors who are sheathed from head to toe in shiny black plate armour. They stand on either side of the approach to the drawbridge with the shafts of their spears crossed to prevent anyone passing without their approval. An Eldenoran captain approaches the guards. He raises his right hand to reveal a leather wristband and they nod their assent. Briskly they withdraw their spears to allow the officer to cross over the drawbridge and enter the inner keep.</p>

       <p>Within the hour you arrive at a junction where the track leaves the forest and joins the beaten road that runs from Tido to Tekaro. This highway borders upon the seemingly endless expanse of the Slovarian Plain, a verdant grassland that stretches away into the far distance. You scan the rolling horizon, wary of the enemy, yet you see little there save for a few wild stallions.</p>
       <p>You turn your horses towards Tekaro and ride on at a comfortable pace. As the morning unfolds, Rouf tells you something of the battles fought across the plains during the past weeks. <quote>This is cavalry country,</quote> he says. <quote>Fighting here is like warring upon the high sea. Swift movement and striking power are the keys to victory. We Slovians are great horsemen and great soldiers and long have we been masters of this land. Our generals boasted that we would destroy the plodding Eldenoran infantry on the open plain, but we had never before encountered the Vorka. Those demons have been our undoing. They can run like ravening wolves and fight as hard as any knight in armour. Alas, if only we knew how to destroy them<ch.ellips/></quote></p>
       <p>Rouf asks you about your mission but wisely you decline to give him any details. <quote>It is not that I do not trust you,</quote> you say, sincerely, <quote>but it is best you do not know. The Eldenorans are not above torturing their captives. If by chance you should be captured again, they will not make you tell what you do not know.</quote></p>
       <p>During the afternoon you pass several Eldenoran riders bound for Tido. Some jeer at Rouf in passing, but none delay nor prevent you from continuing on your way. As night approaches, you reach a junction where a dirt track joins the road from the west. Rouf informs you that this trail leads to his uncle<ch.apos/>s cabin in the woods. You follow the track for three miles until you reach a mound of stones topped by a wooden flagpole fixed with a ragged Slovian flag. When Rouf sees the flag he immediately signals you to halt.</p>
       <p><quote>Something<ch.apos/>s wrong,</quote> he whispers. <quote>That flag<ch.ellips/>it<ch.apos/>s upside down. It<ch.apos/>s a warning sign.</quote></p>
       <p>Quietly you dismount and tether your horses among the trees before approaching the cabin on foot. It rests at the bottom of a shallow ravine and is surrounded by a number of smaller wooden outbuildings. Three saddled horses are tied to a rail beside the main cabin and, when you magnify your vision, you see that their saddles are identical to your own. They are Eldenoran army mounts. Cautiously you approach the cabin and peer in through a side window. Rouf gasps when he sees his Uncle Prizo and Aunt Fie, for they have been tied to chairs and placed back-to-back in the middle of the cabin. Three burly Eldenorans are looting their home and you can hear them threatening to kill them if they do not reveal where they have hidden their gold. The threats make Rouf<ch.apos/>s blood boil. He urges you to help him attack the Eldenorans and save his kinfolk, but you are wary of rushing headlong into the cabin. Clearly the Eldenorans are worthless thieves and to attack them may endanger Prizo and Fie<ch.apos/>s lives.</p>

       <p>The Arrow strikes the rune with devastating effect. There is a tremendous explosion and a splash of fiery green sparks erupts as your shaft cleaves the evil stone in two. The crystal chamber is torn apart and a terrible shriek assails your ears as the air is filled with crackling bolts of green fire. Instinctively you turn away from the explosion and cover your head with your left arm as shards of broken crystal cascade around you, like a rain of deadly daggers.</p>
       <p>When this deluge ceases, you turn back and look with fearful expectation upon the devastated remains of the chamber. Flickering trails of green fire sputter and die among the scattered crystal shards, and the column of dark mist that inhabited its core now swirls around the remains like a small tornado. From its core there comes a hideous shriek and a lance of cold fear stabs at your heart when suddenly you recall having heard this terrible sound once before. This dark shadow is Zorkaan the Soultaker, the entity that you encountered at the clearing in the Grochod Forest, the evil presence that you disturbed as it fed upon the psychic remains of the innocent Slovian prisoners slain and buried there. The whirling shadow of Zorkaan gathers speed and, with a parting wail, it shoots upwards and disappears through the aperture in the hall<ch.apos/>s domed ceiling, into the very eye of the raging storm.</p>
       <p>The noise of the exploding bell-chamber and the hellish shriek of Zorkaan alerts Vandyan to your presence in the hall below. You see his face twisted with rage. He raises a glowing silver disc that is clasped tightly in the palm of his right hand, and then he spits out a vile curse that chills your blood.</p>

       <p>For two hours you ride past the farms, estates, vineyards, and hamlets of the Demera Quilt until you come within sight of Duadon. As you approach the city<ch.apos/>s South Gate, you join a queue of wagons and riders who are waiting their turn to enter. To your left, you note a distant column of supply wagons that is approaching the city<ch.apos/>s West Gate laden with ore and timber: raw materials for Duadon<ch.apos/>s armouries. To the right, a seemingly endless file of Vorka march out from the East Gate towards the River Storn. You watch them closely and your Sixth Sense tells you that they are on their way to bolster the Eldenoran army that is besieging Varetta.</p>

       <p><quote>He<ch.apos/>s gone sick,</quote> you reply.</p>
       <p><quote>I hope it wasn<ch.apos/>t something he ate!</quote> jokes the other guard.</p>
       <p>You can hear the guards eating their food as you walk back along the corridor towards the iron stairs. When you reach the bottom step, you wait here to allow the potion to take effect. After a few minutes you hear a metallic crash, and when you peer over the top step you see that the Ghilev has done its work. Both guards are now lying unconscious in front of the door.</p>

       <p>You awaken shortly before daybreak to the bracing chill of a frosty morning. A pale half-light illuminates the river and surrounding landscape, and you cast your keen eye across it in search of enemy soldiers. Save for distant Tekaro and the Vorka horde encamped around its walls, you see no immediate threat and so you mount your horse and rejoin the highway heading south. After little more than two miles, you come to a wide cinder track that has been newly-laid by Eldenoran engineers to service a military ferry across the great river. You recall Rouf<ch.apos/>s uncle telling you about this ferry and you decide to take a closer look. You steer your horse onto the track and follow it to a large raft which is moored at the river<ch.apos/>s edge. There are six Eldenoran guards on duty here, but none pay you too much attention. They all seem to be nursing hangovers this morning and none feel inclined to speak. You ride onto the raft and remain in the saddle as the flat-bottomed ferry is winched by rope and pulley across the Storn. As soon as it comes to a halt, you ride your horse up a wooden ramp and onto a road that has been cleared and levelled by the Eldenoran army through this part of the Grochod Forest. When you are beyond sight of the ferry, you leave this military road and enter the trees. The timberland is too dense for you to make progress on horseback, so you abandon your mount and continue on foot.</p>

       <p>The Eldenorans make a brief search of the parlour and its adjoining rooms, and one of them tries to open the closet door. You tug on the handle to keep the door shut and the guard quickly abandons his attempt to pull it open, believing that the door is locked. With bated breath you peer through the keyhole and watch two men leaving, dragging their reluctant dog behind them.</p>

       <p>The room beyond appears to be an alchemist<ch.apos/>s workshop.

       <p>Your eye is drawn to a rack of shelves that stretch along one wall. They are filled with hundreds of bottles and stoppered flasks, each one labelled and filled with powders, granules, fluids, or crystals. A cursory inspection of these containers reveals four potions with which you are familiar:</p>
       <ul>

       <p>The rumble of thunder fails to divert the archers<ch.apos/> attention.<footref id="sect275-1" idref="sect275-1-foot"/> As you draw closer, they let fly a deadly volley of arrows that puncture the boat<ch.apos/>s timbers in many places. One shaft pierces your calf and you have to bite your fist to stop yourself from crying out in pain: lose 3 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points.</p>
       <p>Water gushes in where part of the bottom has been holed by arrows. The Eldenorans cheer as your craft begins to founder, and as it disappears from view beneath the central arch, you hear their echoing footfalls as they rush across to the opposite side of the bridge to wait for it to reappear. Quickly you draw upon your healing skills to staunch the flow of blood from your wounded leg and, as the boat emerges, the Eldenorans give another cheer. The water is rushing in so fast now that you decide you must soon abandon the boat. You turn the rudder towards the left bank and aim your sinking craft at a place where a copse of willow trees overhang the river. As you pass beneath their branches, you clamber out and quickly take cover among the trees.</p>
       <p>The Eldenorans soon arrive to inspect their handiwork. Silently you observe them as they drag the half-submerged boat out of the water and sift through its meagre contents. They soon tire of this and return to their duties at the bridge. When the coast is clear, you leave the copse and hurry away. Once you have put more than five miles between yourself and the Eldenorans, you stop to rest for a few hours in the bough of an oak tree.</p>

Here it curves sharply to the east and passes beneath a stone arch which denotes the boundary of the city<ch.apos/>s Northern Quarter. Beyond the arch, the street is lined with all manner of shops and premises, but not one of them is a cooperage.</p>
       <p>At length, the street ends at a tree-lined plaza located near to the northern gatehouse. An iron post stands at its centre, affixed with arrowed signs which show the names of the surrounding streets. They all lead away from the plaza like spokes from the hub of a wheel. Your hopes rise when you see the name <quote>Flank Street</quote> among them, and hurriedly you set off towards it.</p>

       <p>After a few moments the dog scurries off along the tunnel in pursuit of its master. You sense that it has not detected you and so you remain hidden in the fissure, awaiting their return. A few minutes later the Eldenoran and his dog walk back along the tunnel and re-enter the chamber. You hear the men talking in hushed tones as they gather up their loot and load it into their backpacks. They suspect that they have been discovered and they are about to abandon their hiding place.</p>
       <p>Silently you slip out of the fissure and retrace your steps back to the tunnel entrance. You pause here to draw your Kai Weapon and land a blow at the base of a ceiling prop. The rotten timber rips in two and several tons of rock cascade into the tunnel. When the dust settles you see that the mine shaft is now sealed off.</p>
       <p>You leave the collapsed mine entrance and hurry away along the base of the ravine. Night is fast approaching and you have barely covered a mile when the ravine ends abruptly at the edge of a deep gorge. Less than a hundred yards away to the west you can see the outline of a rocky knoll with a slate base that juts out over the rim of this steep, wooded valley. To the east, the gorge cuts a deep furrow through the forest for several miles. There appears to be no easy way of avoiding the gorge, but you are unwilling to attempt a descent in the dark. Instead, you decide to find somewhere safe nearby where you can make camp and await the dawn.</p>

       <p>The third tumbler clicks into position and the door swings open to reveal a vaulted corridor leading to a flight of iron steps.<footref id="sect280-1" idref="sect280-1-foot"/> You enter, and the door closes silently behind you. There is a junction halfway along the corridor where another passage crosses from left to right. You hurry across and climb the metal steps but, as you are approaching the top of the stairs, you catch a glimpse of two armoured guards beyond. They are standing to attention before a large door that is engraved with mystic symbols. Your Sixth Sense detects that beyond this door lie the Runes of Agarash. Instinctively you duck below their line of sight, and then quietly you retreat to the junction. Here you detect the sound of footsteps approaching, and when you spin around to face them, you see a young kitchen attendant walking along the passageway towards you. He is carrying a tray laden with food and he stops abruptly when he sees you suddenly appear. Fearful that he may raise the alarm, you stride towards him and say in an accusing tone: <quote>Why are you late, boy? Lord Vandyan has been kept waiting more than an hour for his food!</quote></p>
       <p><quote>But<ch.ellips/>but this is not for his lordship,</quote> answers the young man, clearly confused by your rebuke. <quote>It<ch.apos/>s for the guards at the door to the Rune Hall.</quote></p>
       <p><quote>What!</quote> you reply, feigning outrage. <quote>You mean to say that you would put the feeding of two lowly guards before our master<ch.apos/>s needs! This is intolerable!</quote></p>
       <p><quote>No<ch.ellips/>no<ch.ellips/>I mean, I was told by the cook to take this tray to the guards. Lord Vandyan ate a meal in his chambers some three hours ago. I<ch.apos/>ve had no order to take him food since.</quote></p>
       <p><quote>Well, our master is hungry,</quote> you reply, <quote>and you<ch.apos/>d better go back to the kitchen and find him something suitable to eat this instant<ch.ellips/>if you value your hide, that is!</quote> Forcefully you snatch the tray from the bemused assistant, saying: <quote>Go tell cook to prepare him something substantial, understand? He<ch.apos/>s very hungry. I<ch.apos/>ll deliver these scraps to the guards myself.</quote></p>
       <p>The confused young assistant scratches his head and then he hurries away to deliver your order to the cook. You watch him until he turns a distant corner, and then you look down at the tray of cold meat and vegetables and an idea takes shape, an idea that may help you gain entry to the Rune Hall.</p>

Fortunately, they are too preoccupied with their marching and other duties to spare a lowly horse-scout more than a second glance.</p>
       <p>The sun has set and dusk is surrendering to darkness by the time you reach Tekaro. The rolling fields around this old walled city are swarming with Vorka regiments, and the fetid smell of their scaly hides gusts towards you on the chill night breeze.</p>

Coolly you release your shaft and it flies true, yet an unwitting guard runs in front of his master and it is he who perishes when your arrow pierces his heart. This close shave makes the cowardly Vandyan immediately take cover behind the hall door, from where he barks orders to his men to advance towards the platform. Fearful of being cut off, you shoulder your Bow and hurry towards the open trapdoor.</p>

       <p>The Arrow strikes the rune with devastating effect. There is a tremendous explosion and a splash of fiery green sparks erupts as your shaft cleaves the evil stone in two. Moments later, the bell-chamber is swallowed up by sheets of orange flame and instinctively you cover your head with your left arm as shards of broken stone cascade around you, like a rain of deadly daggers. When this deluge ceases, you look with fearful expectation upon the devastated remains of the bell-chamber.</p>
       <p>Pools of fire burn among the shards that litter the floor of the pit, and the Vorka that were spawned in its core now lie twisted and lifeless among the flaming ruins. The sight of this burning devastation is shocking to behold, yet you feel elated when you sense that the breaking of the rune has, at a single stroke, destroyed every Vorka that has ever emerged from the spawning chamber.</p>
       <p>The noise of the destruction and the hellish dying shrieks of the Vorka horde alert Vandyan to your presence in the hall below. You look up and see his face twisted with rage. He raises a glowing silver disc, clasped tightly in the palm of his right hand, and he spits out a vile curse that chills your blood.</p>

       <p>You take off your Backpack and pull aside its flap to expose part of the bejewelled Chalice. The guards<ch.apos/> eyes fill with naked avarice when they glimpse its gem-encrusted gold, and they can barely contain their excitement. Quickly they wave the wagon through into the city and then order the following traffic to wait while they escort you to the gatehouse. You are beginning to think that they are going to confiscate the Chalice and throw you in a cell, but the taller guard soon eases your fears. Quietly he says to you: <quote>Don<ch.apos/>t worry, friend. We<ch.apos/>ll jus<ch.apos/> go somewhere private. We don<ch.apos/>t want all o<ch.apos/> Duadon witnessing our business.</quote></p>
       <p>You accompany the guards into the gatehouse and along a corridor to an empty chamber where a small door is set into the wall. You hand over the Tekaro Chalice (erase this Backpack Item from your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>) and the guards unlock the door. It opens on to a quiet alleyway overshadowed by the city<ch.apos/>s south wall. <quote>Off y<ch.apos/>go, trooper,</quote> says the tall guard, and he ushers you through the arched doorway.</p>
       <p>The door shuts behind you with a dull thud and you hear a key turning in the lock. You leave the door and walk along the alleyway towards the gatehouse arch. From the shadows, you observe the large flagstoned square at the approach to the South Gate and note that the traffic of wagons has resumed. They trundle across the square and enter a wide avenue called Bannerway, which leads to Vandyan<ch.apos/>s stronghold of Skull-Tor at the centre of the city.</p>
       <p>You recall Gwynian<ch.apos/>s briefing that the agents you must contact can be found in Flank Street, in the city<ch.apos/>s Northern Quarter. You are presently in the Southern Quarter of Duadon and so you enter the square and follow the line of wagons that is heading towards Skull-Tor. You are hoping that this avenue will be the quickest way to reach the Northern Quarter, but unfortunately your plan comes to a premature end when you discover that Bannerway has been reserved for the use of supply wagons only. Armed guardsmen control access to the avenue and they turn you away as you are about to enter on foot. Undeterred, you resolve to find another route across Duadon to the Northern Quarter. Looking around the soot-blackened buildings, you see two other roads that lead off from the South Gate square to the east and west. The west road is called Knucklebone Lane and the east road is called Kettle Street.</p>

When it comes to within an arm<ch.apos/>s length, you leap up from your hiding place and draw your Kai Weapon with one swift and fluid motion. You strike fast and hard, wounding the Vorka in the throat to prevent it from shrieking out in alarm. The wound is deep, yet the creature is remarkably resilient. It quickly recovers from the shock of your attack and it leaps at you with its clawed hands outstretched. You must fight the creature.</p>

       <p>Your blow is poorly timed and it glances harmlessly off the rider<ch.apos/>s heavy black armour. As you gallop past, he lashes out at you with a spiked ball and chain and it clips the back of your head.

       <p>The blow from your enemy<ch.apos/>s weapon renders you unconscious and sends you spinning out of the saddle. You never regain consciousness. The Sinistrari bear down on you and ruthlessly they trample your helpless body beneath the hooves of their warhorses. Death is painless and instantaneous.</p>
       <p>You may take some comfort in the fact that you fulfilled your vital mission. By destroying the Runes of Agarash you have saved Magnamund from the tyrannical rule of Vandyan and his monstrous horde. It is a great victory, but one that you have paid for with your life.</p>

       <p>You crouch down at the rear of the boat and cover yourself with a ragged sheet of canvas. Through a rent in the fabric you can see the bridge getting closer and carefully you trim the rudder to steer your craft towards its central stone arch. Once again there is a shrill whistle and the Vorka begin to screech with excitement. You hear them running along the muddy bank, and then there is a loud splash when one of them dives headlong into the river.</p>
       <p>As you come to within 20 yards of the bridge, the Eldenoran archers let loose their first volley of arrows.</p>

       <p>Beyond the open portal you descend by ramp and stair to the floor of a large hall. It is ringed with marble pillars and its walls are draped with Eldenoran battle-flags. The centre of the hall is dominated by a large refectory table around which are huddled groups of Eldenoran officers. They are poring over charts and battle-maps which show the positions of their Vorka hordes and the defensive lines of the Freeland armies. Messengers come and go, delivering and collecting orders, and nobody seems to pay you special attention as you quietly pass among these high-ranking officers.</p>

       <p>Quickly you draw upon your advanced Kai Discipline to conjure up a mist that engulfs you and your immediate enemies. This disorients the Vorka just long enough for you to be able to reach the rune and strike it with devastating effect. There is a tremendous explosion and a splash of fiery green sparks erupts as your blade cleaves the evil stone in two. Then the bell-chamber is swallowed up by sheets of orange flame and you are hurled backwards to the floor. Shards of broken stone whistle around you. When the rain of debris ceases, you pull yourself to your feet and look upon the devastated remains of the bell-chamber. Pools of fire burn among the splinters that litter the floor of the pit, and all the Vorka that were spawned in its core now lie twisted and lifeless among the flaming ruins. The sight of this burning devastation is shocking to behold, yet you feel elated when you sense that the breaking of the rune has, at a single stroke, destroyed every Vorka that has ever emerged from the spawning chamber.</p>

       <p>The old woman tells you to approach the stairs. Slowly she descends to the bottom step and, as the light from her lantern washes over you, she scrutinizes your clothing and your features.</p>
       <p><quote>You have the face of a Northlander yet you wear the uniform of Vandyan<ch.apos/>s army. What are you<ch.ellips/>a mercenary in his pay?</quote></p>
       <p><quote>No, ma<ch.apos/>am,</quote> you reply, politely. <quote>I<ch.apos/>m no mercenary. I<ch.apos/>m Sommlending, and though I wear this uniform I do not fight for Vandyan. I fight against him. If you will grant me shelter this night, you will be hastening the day when Tekaro is freed from Vandyan<ch.apos/>s grasp.</quote></p>
       <p>The truth and sincerity of your words touch her heart and readily she agrees to let you stay. She also gives you a meal of bread and meat and she provides some feed for your tired horse. You sleep well and leave her house before dawn to avoid being seen. The alleyways and streets of this quarter are empty at this early hour and you do not see any Eldenorans until you reach a tree-lined avenue that leads to the plaza of Tekaro Cathedral. The enemy have turned this magnificent building into a dormitory for their troops and, as you pass by its open doors, you glimpse hundreds of soldiers asleep on the floor of its central nave. Guards posted on the steps regard you with suspicion as your horse plods his way across the plaza. Gently you urge him on lest they should stop and challenge you.</p>
       <p>At the end of a street flanked by warehouses and guildhalls you come to the city<ch.apos/>s south gatehouse. A guard casts a cursory glance at your horse and uniform and, upon seeing that you are a scout, he pulls a chain which operates the heavy oak portal. The gate creaks open and quickly you ride through it and out onto a highway beyond. This broad road runs parallel to the River Storn and you follow it for five miles before you come to a wide cinder track, newly-laid by Eldenoran engineers to service their military ferry across the great river. You recall Rouf<ch.apos/>s uncle telling you about the ferry and you decide to take a closer look. You steer your horse onto the cinder track and descend towards a large raft which is moored at the river. There are six Eldenoran guards on duty here, but none pay you too much attention. They all appear to be nursing hangovers this morning and none feel inclined to speak. You ride onto the raft and remain in the saddle as the flat-bottomed ferry is winched by rope and pulley across the Storn. As soon as it comes to a halt, you ride your horse up a wooden ramp and onto a road that has been cleared and levelled by the Eldenoran army through this part of the Grochod Forest. Once you are clear and beyond sight of the ferry, you leave this military road and enter the trees. The forest is too dense for you to continue on horseback, so you abandon your mount and continue on foot.</p>

       <p>Hulsta bids his wife a fond farewell and she, in turn, wishes you good luck and godspeed. During your absence she will make arrangements for your escape from Duadon to a place of safety. <quote>May Ishir protect you both,</quote> she says, as she watches you descend the steps and walk across the yard to the rear gate.</p>
       <p>Running along the back wall of Hulsta<ch.apos/>s yard is an alleyway, one of a thousand such passages that weave around the main streets of Duadon like capillaries around veins. It is dark now, and the alleys are unlit, yet Hulsta leads you expertly through the maze of narrow passageways. Soon you arrive at the rear of a three-storey shop where Hulsta stops to peer over the rear wall.</p>
       <p><quote>This is the place I showed you on the plans,</quote> he whispers. <quote>I came here three months ago to make sure that it<ch.apos/>s still possible to get into the old tunnel from here.

You examine the door and detect that it is not bolted. It is secured by a simple mortise lock.</p>

       <p>As you approach the door, your Kai Sixth Sense tells you that the chamber beyond is empty. Confident in your natural ability, you twist the iron handle and push against the heavy portal. Silently it swings open on well-oiled hinges to reveal an empty circular chamber. A large iron-rimmed chute is set into its stone wall, and when you examine this opening, your stomach turns. Its surfaces are smeared with traces of human blood. You can hear the distant sound of rushing water and suddenly you realize that this chute leads directly to the river which flows beneath Duadon. From its condition and location you conclude that this chute has a single, sinister purpose: it is used by the gaolers of Skull-Tor for the swift disposal of prisoners who die in their charge.</p>

       <p>Quickly you gather your equipment and hurry back to the edge of the gorge in search of safer shelter from this ferocious storm. Through the sheeting rain you can see the rocky knoll. It is devoid of trees and undergrowth and offers no protection from the lashing rain, but when you magnify your vision you notice that beneath its jutting slate base there is a dry hollow.</p>
       <p>You struggle through the mud and eventually you reach the hollow. Shivering and exhausted, you settle yourself down and attempt to sleep here while the storm rages unabated. Unless you possess the Discipline of Grand Huntmastery, you must now eat a Meal or lose 3 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points.</p>
       <p>Throughout the long night you are awoken several times by concussive booms of thunder that roll and reverberate along the gorge. For a while you sit up and watch the wild and terrible beauty of this ferocious storm, but the fatigue of your long day<ch.apos/>s march cannot be suppressed for too long and you find yourself drifting off into fits of restless sleep.</p>
       <p>It is an hour after dawn when you finally decide to leave the hollow and press on with your long trek north. The worst of the storm has now passed but the rains persist and they hamper your progress. During the morning of the third day you catch sight of a trail that bisects the forest, running north to south. The heavy rain has transformed this dirt trail into a quagmire and several Eldenoran army wagons, laden with weapons and supplies, have become bogged down in the gluey mud. The troops attached to these wagons have set up tents among the trees and, to avoid the risk of running into them, you make a short detour to the east before continuing northwards once more.</p>
       <p>During the afternoon of the fourth day you stumble upon a clearing close to the northern perimeter of the Grochod Forest. The ground here is studded with sawn stumps and the soft soil is freshly turned, indicating that this area has only recently been cleared of trees. As you look across the clearing you feel a prickling sensation at the nape of your neck. It is your Kai Sixth Sense and it is warning you that this place harbours a sinister secret.</p>

       <p>As you ride along the highway that heads north from Duadon, you see in the distance a pair of grassy hillocks. The highway passes between them before rising to a cultivated plateau which is crisscrossed with irrigation channels. You are drawing closer to the hillocks when you notice two units of armoured riders are stationed here, one unit on either side of the road. These horsemen are clad in fearsome suits of black armour, embellished with skulls and scarlet dragons, and their mounts are similarly protected by plates of burnished steel that shimmer like liquid fire in the light of the setting sun.</p>

The mounting tension draws beads of cold perspiration from your brow, but these enemy riders offer you no challenge and you are able to continue unhindered. As you emerge from the hillocks, you whisper to Delissa out of the side of your mouth. <quote>Just keep riding<ch.ellips/>and don<ch.apos/>t look back!</quote></p>
       <p>It is not until you reach the safety of the plateau that you dare glance back over your shoulder at Vandyan<ch.apos/>s horsemen, now five miles distant. Beyond them, silhouetted black against the darkening sky, you see the walls of Duadon and the domed peak of Skull-Tor. Now that you are safely beyond reach, you raise your fist and give voice to a defiant cry of victory.</p>

       <p>You leave the ridge and trek across a ploughed field to get to a large barn, the closest of three outbuildings surrounding the remote farmhouse. You enter this barn through a rear door and discover that it shelters twelve milk cows, housed in stalls, and a few dozen chickens which are penned into a corner. You climb a ladder to a hay-loft where you discover a small store of milk, cheese, and eggs (enough for 2 Meals). You feel tired after your earlier ordeal in the Grochod Forest, and so you make a comfortable nest in the hay and settle yourself down for some much needed sleep.</p>
       <p>You are awoken shortly before dawn by the sound of whistling. It is the farmer<ch.apos/>s eldest son and he has risen early to milk the cows. Carefully you crawl to the ladder and look down to see the young man standing directly below. He is holding a pitchfork in his right hand and he is about to climb up the ladder. You pull away to avoid being seen and hurriedly you look around for another way out. The only other exit is a small loading door through which bales of hay are hoisted by line and pulley into the loft.</p>

       <p>A great door in the north wall of the hall swings open and through it strides a lean and elegant man, clad in a flamboyant tunic of emerald and gold. He moves with the confident grace of an athlete, yet his true age is revealed by his sagging jowls and the loose folds of skin that hang down below his dark, malevolent eyes. The gathering of officers salute their leader, Lord Vandyan, and they applaud when he climbs the steps of a marble dais in readiness to deliver his address.</p>
       <p><quote>Varetta will be ours by midnight tomorrow!</quote> he announces, to a roar of approval. <quote>The legions of Vorka that I have dispatched to Lyris will ensure this victory. The Kai have been sighted at Quarlen but we will entrap them. Our victorious armies will march north from Suentina and cross the Slovarian Range through the North Pass. We shall cut off their supply route to Casiorn and attack their defences at Quarlen from the rear. The Kai will have but two choices: to die in Quarlen or be forced north into the abyss of the Maakengorge.</quote> Upon hearing this, the Eldenorans cheer their arrogant leader and praise his martial skill. However, his ambitious strategy to defeat the Kai fails to impress you for you know that Lone Wolf will be prepared for such an eventuality. You think it more likely that Vandyan<ch.apos/>s army will perish when it attempts to traverse the treacherous North Pass.</p>
       <p>Vandyan raises his hand and motions for silence. As the cheering dies away, he continues his address. His plans for the defeat of the Kai have failed to impress you, but when he reveals his strategy for the conquest of all Magnamund, it is then that you feel an icy chill of fear run down your spine.</p>

       <p>You take off your Backpack and pull aside its flap to expose part of the bejewelled Chalice. The guards<ch.apos/> eyes fill with naked avarice when they glimpse its gem-encrusted gold, and they can barely contain their excitement. They order the following riders and wagons to wait while they escort you away to the gatehouse. You are beginning to think that they intend to confiscate the Chalice and throw you in a cell, but the taller guard soon eases your fears. Quietly he says to you: <quote>Don<ch.apos/>t worry, friend. We<ch.apos/>ll jus<ch.apos/> go somewhere private. We don<ch.apos/>t want all o<ch.apos/> Duadon witnessing our business.</quote></p>
       <p>You accompany the guards into the gatehouse and along a corridor to an empty chamber where a small door is set into the wall. You hand over the Tekaro Chalice (erase this Backpack Item from your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>) and the guards unlock the door. It opens on to a quiet alleyway overshadowed by the city<ch.apos/>s south wall. <quote>Off y<ch.apos/>go, trooper,</quote> says the tall guard, and he ushers you through the arched doorway.</p>
       <p>The door shuts behind you with a dull thud and you hear a key turning in the lock. You leave the door and walk along the narrow alleyway towards the gatehouse arch. From the shadows, you observe the flagstoned square at the approach to the South Gate and note that the portcullis is raised and the flow of traffic has resumed. Wagons trundle across the square and enter a wide avenue called Bannerway, which leads to Vandyan<ch.apos/>s stronghold of Skull-Tor at the centre of the city.</p>
       <p>You recall Gwynian<ch.apos/>s briefing that the agents you must contact can be found in Flank Street, in the city<ch.apos/>s Northern Quarter. You are presently in the Southern Quarter of Duadon and so you enter the square and follow the line of wagons that are heading towards Skull-Tor. You are hoping that this avenue will be the quickest way to reach the Northern Quarter, but unfortunately you soon discover that Bannerway has been reserved for the use of supply wagons only. Armed guardsmen control access to the avenue and they turn you away as you attempt to enter on foot. Undeterred, you resolve to find another route across Duadon to the Northern Quarter. Looking around the soot-blackened buildings, you see two other roads that lead off from the South Gate square, to the east and west.

Along the left wall of this windswept hallway are tall arched windows that command a view of the parade ground surrounding the inner keep of Skull-Tor. You recall Hulsta speaking about this keep shortly before his untimely death and, when you focus your Kai senses upon its imposing walls, you detect that it harbours the evil power that you have come to destroy. From the cover of the antechamber, you observe the keep and determine that entry to it can only be gained via a drawbridge which gives access to an archway located some 20 feet above the ground. To reach this bridge, you will have to ascend to the next level of Skull-Tor. This will not be an easy task, for the hallway and the parade ground are swarming with Eldenoran officers and Vorka slaves.</p>

       <p><quote>One of my ancestors was an engineer who worked on the construction of Skull-Tor,</quote> says Hulsta. <quote>These are his original plans<ch.emdash/>the only ones that remain in existence today.</quote></p>
       <p>The parchment has faded with the passing of centuries, yet it still contains a wealth of information. Hulsta indicates the perimeter of the fortress<ch.apos/>s inner keep, its great arch, and the location of several subterranean chambers. Of particular interest is the course of an underground river, which passes directly below the fortress, and a series of tunnels which connect Skull-Tor to remote parts of the city.</p>
       <p><quote>These passageways were constructed as escape routes for Prince Jiokara, the ruler who commissioned the building of Skull-Tor. Many have since been sealed off or have collapsed into the river, but there is one that still exists.</quote> Hulsta indicates its location on the map and you notice that it passes beneath the city<ch.apos/>s Northern Quarter.</p>
       <p><quote>We can gain entry to this tunnel from the cellar of a building located on the corner of Cillan Square. I propose we go there tonight. I shall act as your guide and I will take you into Skull-Tor by this route. Once we have gained entry, you must complete your mission alone. I will stay in the tunnel and await your return. Then I shall bring you out of the tunnel and escort you to a safe place where we can await the arrival of the victorious Freeland armies.</quote></p>

Before you set off, he excuses himself for a few minutes so that he may change out of his working clothes. While he is getting dressed, Delissa suggests that you may wish to visit their workshop.</p>

       <p>As Vandyan<ch.apos/>s vile curse echoes around the hall, the procession of Vorka that are streaming from the bell-chamber suddenly slows to a halt. As if awakening from a walking sleep, they rub their eyes and take stock of their surroundings; then they come swarming towards the iron steps. They are quickly joined by others of their kind who pour back into the pit from the archway on the far side. These Vorka are armed with bladed weapons, and beyond the archway you glimpse the armoury whence they have returned.</p>

Hundreds of gallons are stored here in stout wooden casks that line the walls. Hulsta hurries past them to the southeast corner of the cellar where he drops to his knees. Carefully he places the lantern down on the floor and then he runs his hands lightly across the surface.</p>

The worst of the storm has passed but the rains persist to hamper swift progress. During the morning of the third day you catch sight of a trail that bisects the forest, running north to south. The heavy rain has transformed this dirt trail into a quagmire and several Eldenoran army wagons, laden with weapons and supplies, have become bogged down in the gluey mud. The troops attached to these wagons have sought shelter among the trees and, to avoid running into them, you make a short detour to the east before continuing northwards once more.</p>

       <p>You confide in Rouf that you are on a secret mission and that you must reach the River Storn near Tekaro as soon as you can. Now that your sailboat has been destroyed by fire, you have little option but to continue by horse. Rouf offers to help but he warns you that the city of Tekaro has fallen to the Eldenorans. They occupy the city and have thousands of their Vorka encamped outside its walls. From Tekaro they have been sending reinforcements to their armies fighting across the Slovarian Plain and along the River Suen. This whole region is alive with enemy patrols and it will be difficult for you to avoid them on your way to the Storn. Rouf suggests that you wear one of the dead Eldenorans<ch.apos/> uniform, and that he accompany you upon the road to Tekaro, posing as your prisoner. His uncle lives in the forest near the River Quarl, a day<ch.apos/>s ride from here, and that is where he wants to go now that he is free.</p>
       <p>You agree to his plan and swap your Kai journeyman clothes for the uniform of a dead Eldenoran scout. (You stow your own kit in your Backpack, which requires space equal to two normal items. If your Backpack is full, you must discard two items to create sufficient space for your Kai Clothes.) Having changed uniform, you mount one of the Eldenoran horses and ride with Rouf back along the forest track heading south towards Tekaro.</p>

       <p>You inspect the vials closely and your advanced Kai skills help you to determine that the strange jelly-like substances contained within these glass tubes possess strong psychic properties.</p>
       <p>You cannot accurately gauge the strength of these psychic potions, but you are able to determine their effects. The contents of the Red Vial, when swallowed before psychic combat, will increase your mental defences. The contents of the Blue Vial will boost your psychic attacks. The contents of the Yellow Vial, however, will reduce the effectiveness of your psychic defences and could render you especially vulnerable to mental assault.</p>
       <p>If you wish to keep the Red Vial, the Blue Vial, or the Yellow Vial, record them on your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a> as Special Items which you carry in your tunic pocket.</p>

       <p>It is nearly dark when you enter the hills and ride with Delissa to your rendezvous at Xaitar<ch.apos/>s Rock. Within minutes of arriving at this spire of weathered granite, you see a thin sliver of light in the darkening sky. You magnify your vision and your heart skips a beat when you see that this sliver is the sleek metal hull of <cite>Cloud-dancer</cite><ch.emdash/>Guildmaster Banedon<ch.apos/>s wondrous flying ship<ch.emdash/>fast approaching from the southwest.</p>
       <p>Banedon brings his vessel to a halt directly above the spire of rock. Then a landing cage is winched down and a young Toranese crewman beckons you and your companion to step inside. Your stomach flutters as the cage is hoisted up to the deck of the flying ship where the Guildmaster himself is waiting to greet you and congratulate you upon the success of your mission.</p>

       <p>Within minutes of your arrival aboard, a new route is charted and <cite>Cloud-dancer</cite> is set on course for the city of Varetta. The journey by air takes little more than two hours and, although darkness has fallen, Banedon has little difficulty locating the city. Its siege-damaged walls are ringed with beacons of fire that are visible from 50 miles. As you draw closer, you see the lifeless remains of the Vorka horde spread out across the plain surrounding Varetta, and the regiments of the Freeland Alliance marching proudly towards the city gates. The beacons guide Banedon<ch.apos/>s craft towards the centre of the city where it is made to hover above the Halls of Learning. Swiftly you are lowered by cage to the grounds of this magnificent building where the New Order Kai are encamped. You are greeted by the thunderous cheer of your fellow kinsmen, and the proud embrace of Lone Wolf and Gwynian the Sage. It is a joyful and victorious reunion, one that will live forever in your memory and in the legends of the New Order Kai.</p>
       <p>News of your arrival spreads quickly through Varetta and you are f<ch.ecirc/>ted by its grateful citizens. By your brave action, the cruel siege of their city was lifted. Following a night of celebration, Lone Wolf orders you to return in triumph to the Kai Monastery aboard <cite>Cloud-dancer</cite> the next day. He will ride home with the New Order and arrive with them in a week<ch.apos/>s time. Gladly you obey your leader<ch.apos/>s command, and shortly before noon you wave farewell to your proud brothers from the deck of Banedon<ch.apos/>s magnificent flying ship.</p>
       <p>Early the next day, you arrive at the Kai Monastery and deliver the glad news of your victory at Skull-Tor. Warmly the defenders praise your achievement and listen in awe when you recount the details of your perilous mission. You inform them that Lone Wolf and the Kai crusaders are returning from Varetta and will arrive at the monastery one week from today. You are now the highest ranking Kai present at the monastery and so you take charge and oversee preparations for their welcome home.</p>
       <p>Five days pass and the preparations are completed ahead of schedule. Everyone is looking forward with eager anticipation to their return. It is late in the afternoon when a Kai scout named Gold Rain arrives unexpectedly at the monastery. His face and clothes are badly travel-stained, and it is clear from his state of near-exhaustion that he has ridden hard without rest. You are hoping that he brings glad tidings, but you soon learn the contrary. Gold Rain has grave and shocking news to impart.</p>
       <p>You learn that Lone Wolf has disappeared. During an overnight encampment on the outskirts of Ruanon, your leader was abducted. Those who witnessed the abduction said that Lone Wolf was engulfed by a whirling black shadow that fell upon him from out of a stormy sky. So swift was the attack that your fellow Grand Masters were unable to prevent him from being carried away.</p>
       <p>A cold chill runs down your spine when you listen to Gold Rain<ch.apos/>s report. His description of the whirling black shadow is identical to the form adopted by Zorkaan the Soultaker. You are filled with a gnawing sense of doubt, a fear that the destruction of the rune used by Vandyan to summon Zorkaan did not bring about the fell creature<ch.apos/>s demise. Instead, it has trapped Zorkaan on Magnamund. Immediately you suspect that Lone Wolf<ch.apos/>s abduction is an act of revenge. Your Sixth Sense tells you that Lone Wolf is still alive and present somewhere upon Magnamund, but you cannot determine where that place is.</p>
       <p>You have achieved a great victory at Duadon, but the shocking news of Lone Wolf<ch.apos/>s disappearance casts a shadow of doubt over your triumph there. You fear that the loss of your illustrious leader is too high a price to pay for the defeat of Vandyan and his Vorka hordes. Your natural instinct is to do everything in your power to find Lone Wolf and release him from his shadowy abductor. But this will be a great and difficult task, one that is sure to test your bravery and skills to the limit. If you have the courage and resolve of a true Grand Master, the challenge of finding and freeing Lone Wolf awaits you in the next exciting adventure, entitled:</p>
