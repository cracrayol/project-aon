     <p>In the northern land of Sommerlund, it has been the custom for many centuries to send the children of the Warrior Lords to the monastery of Kai. There they are taught the skills and disciplines of their noble fathers.</p>
     <p>The Kai monks are masters of their art, and the children in their charge love and respect them in spite of the hardships of their training. For one day when they have finally learnt the secret skills of the Kai, they will return to their homes equipped in mind and body to defend themselves against the constant threat of war from the Darklords of the west.</p>
     <p>In olden times, during the Age of the Black Moon, the Darklords waged war on Sommerlund. The conflict was a long and bitter trial of strength that ended in victory for the Sommlending at the great battle of Maakengorge. King Ulnar and the allies of Durenor broke the Darkland armies at the pass of Moytura and forced them back into the bottomless abyss of Maakengorge. Vashna, mightiest of the Darklords, was slain upon the sword of King Ulnar, called <quote>Sommerswerd</quote>, the sword of the sun. Since that age, the Darklords have vowed vengeance upon Sommerlund and the House of Ulnar.</p>
     <p>Now it is in the morning of the feast of Fehmarn, when all of the Kai Lords are present at the monastery for the celebrations. Suddenly a great black cloud comes from out of the western skies. So many are the numbers of the black-winged beasts that fill the sky, that the sun is completely hidden. The Darklords, ancient enemy of the Sommlending, are attacking. War has begun.</p>
     <p>On this fateful morning, you, Silent Wolf (the name given to you by the Kai) have been sent to collect firewood in the forest as a punishment for your inattention in class. As you are preparing to return, you see to your horror a vast cloud of black leathery creatures swoop down and engulf the monastery.</p>
     <p>Dropping the wood, you race to the battle that has already begun. But in the unnatural dark, you stumble and strike your head on a low tree branch. As you lose consciousness, the last thing that you see in the poor light is the walls of the monastery crashing to the ground.</p>
     <p>Many hours pass before you awake. With tears in your eyes you now survey the scene of destruction. Raising your face to the clear sky, you swear vengeance on the Darklords for the massacre of the Kai warriors, and with a sudden flash of realization you know what you must do. You must set off on a perilous journey to the capital city to warn the King of the terrible threat that now faces his people. For you are now the last of the Kai<ch.emdash/>you are now the Lone Wolf.</p>

     <p>You keep a record of your adventure on the <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
     <p>During your training as a Kai Lord you have developed fighting prowess<ch.emdash/><typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> and physical stamina<ch.emdash/><typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ>. Before you set off on your adventure you need to measure how effective your training has been. To do this take a pencil and, with your eyes closed, point with the blunt end of it onto the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a>. If you pick 0 it counts as zero.</p>
     <p>The first number that you pick from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> in this way represents your <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ>. Add 10 to the number you picked and write the total in the <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> section of your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a> (i.e. if your pencil fell on the number 4 in the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> you would write in a <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> of 14). When you fight, your <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> will be pitted against that of your enemy. A high score in this section is therefore very desirable.</p>
     <p>The second number that you pick from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> represents your powers of <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ>. Add 20 to this number and write the total in the <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> section of your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a> (i.e. if your pencil fell on the number 6 on the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> you would have 26 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points).</p>
     <p>If you are wounded in combat you will lose <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points. If at any time your <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points fall to zero or below, you are dead and the adventure is over. Lost <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points can be regained during the course of the adventure, but your number of <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points can never go above the number with which you start your adventure.</p>

       <p>Over the centuries, the Kai monks have mastered the skills of the warrior. These skills are known as the Kai Disciplines, and they are taught to all Kai Lords. You have learnt only five of the skills listed below. The choice of which five skills these are, is for you to make. As all of the Disciplines may be of use to you at some point on your perilous quest, pick your five with care. The correct use of a Discipline at the right time can save your life.</p>
       <p>When you have chosen your five Disciplines, enter them in the Kai Disciplines section of your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>.</p>

         <p>This Discipline enables a Kai Lord to blend in with his surroundings. In the countryside, he can hide undetected among trees and rocks and pass close to an enemy without being seen. In a town or city, it enables him to look and sound like a native of that area, and can help him to find shelter or a safe hiding place.</p>

         <p>Upon entering the Kai Monastery, each initiate is taught to master one type of weapon. If Weaponskill is to be one of your Kai Disciplines, pick a number in the usual way from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a>, and then find the corresponding weapon from the list below. This is the weapon in which you have skill. When you enter combat carrying this weapon, you add 2 points to your <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ>.</p>
         <p>The fact that you are skilled with a weapon does not mean you set out on the adventure carrying that particular weapon. However, you will have opportunities to acquire weapons in the course of your adventures. If you pick the axe, you are lucky enough to be skilled in the one weapon Lone Wolf is carrying from the start of the adventure. (This will be explained fully in the <a idref="equipmnt">Equipment section</a>.)</p>

       <p>There will be occasions on your adventure when you have to fight an enemy. The enemy<ch.apos/>s <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> and <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points are given in the text. Lone Wolf<ch.apos/>s aim in the combat is to kill the enemy by reducing his <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points to zero while losing as few <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points as possible himself.</p>
       <p>At the start of a combat, enter Lone Wolf<ch.apos/>s and the enemy<ch.apos/>s <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points in the appropriate boxes on the Combat Record section of your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
       <p>The sequence for combat is as follows.</p>
       <ol class="paragraphed">
        <li><p>Add any extra points gained through your Kai Disciplines to your current <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> total.</p></li>
        <li>
         <p>Subtract the <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> of your enemy from this total. The result is your Combat Ratio. Enter it on the <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
         <p>Example</p>
         <p>Lone Wolf (<typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> 15) is ambushed by a Winged Devil (<typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> 20). He is not given the opportunity to evade combat, but must stand and fight as the creature swoops down on him. Lone Wolf has the Kai Discipline of Mindblast, so he adds 2 points to his <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ>, giving a total <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> of 17.</p>
         <p>He subtracts the Winged Devil<ch.apos/>s <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> from his own, giving a Combat Ratio of <ch.minus/>3 (17 <ch.minus/> 20 = <ch.minus/>3). <ch.minus/>3 is noted on the <a idref="action">Action Chart</a> as the Combat Ratio.</p>
        </li>
        <li><p><a id="stage3">When you have your Combat Ratio</a>, pick a number from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a>.</p></li>
        <li>
         <p>Turn to the <a idref="crtable">Combat Results Table</a>. Along the top of the chart are shown the Combat Ratio numbers. Find the number that is the same as your Combat Ratio and cross-reference it with the random number that you have picked (the random numbers appear on the side of the chart). You now have the number of <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points lost by both Lone Wolf and his enemy in this round of combat. (E represents points lost by the enemy; LW represents points lost by Lone Wolf.)</p>
         <p>Example</p>
         <p>The Combat Ratio between Lone Wolf and Winged Devil has been established as <ch.minus/>3. If the number taken from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> is a 6, then the result of the first round of combat is:</p>
         <ul>
          <li>Lone Wolf loses 3 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points</li>
          <li>Winged Devil loses 6 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points</li>
         </ul>
        </li>
        <li><p>On the <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>, mark the changes in <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points to the participants in the combat.</p></li>
        <li><p>Unless otherwise instructed, or unless you have an option to evade, the next round of combat now starts.</p></li>
        <li><p>Repeat the sequence from <a idref="stage3">Stage 3</a>.</p></li>
       </ol>
       <p>This process of combat continues until the <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points of either the enemy or Lone Wolf are reduced to zero or below, at which point that combatant is declared dead. If Lone Wolf is dead, the adventure is over. If the enemy is dead, Lone Wolf proceeds but with his <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points possibly reduced.</p>

         <p>During your adventure you may be given the chance to evade combat. If you have already engaged in a round of combat and decide to evade, calculate the combat for that round in the usual manner. All points lost by the enemy as a result of that round are ignored, and you make your escape. Only Lone Wolf may lose <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points during that round, but then that is the risk of running away! You may only evade if the text of the particular section allows you to do so.</p>

     <p>Your mission will be one of great danger, for the Darklords and their servants are a cruel and fierce enemy who give and expect no mercy. Use the <a idref="map">map</a> to help you steer a correct course for the capital. Make notes as you progress through the story, for they will be of great help in future adventures.</p>
     <p>Many things that you find will aid you during the adventure. Some Special Items will be of use in future <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> adventures and others may be red herrings of no real use at all, so be selective in what you decide to keep.</p>
     <p>There are many routes to the King, but only one involves a minimum of danger. With a wise choice of Kai Disciplines and a great deal of courage, any player should be able to complete the mission, no matter how weak their initial <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> or <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points score.</p>
     <p>The honour and memory of the Kai Lords will go with you on your perilous journey.</p>

       <p>For what seems an eternity, the rush of the crowd carries you along like a leaf on a fast-flowing stream. You desperately fight to stay on your feet, but you feel weak and dizzy from your ordeal, and your legs are as heavy as lead. Suddenly, you catch a glimpse of a long, narrow stone stairway that leads up to the roof of an inn.</p>
       <p>Gathering the last reserves of your strength, you dive for the stairs and climb slowly up to the top. From here you can see the magnificent view of the rooftops and spires of Holmgard, with the high stone walls of the citadel gleaming in the sun.</p>

       <p>The houses and buildings of the capital are built very close to each other, and it is possible to jump from one roof to the next. In fact many of the citizens of Holmgard used to use the <quote>Roofways</quote> (as they are known) when the heavy autumn rains made the unpaved parts of the streets too muddy for walking. But after many accidents, a royal decree forbade their use.</p>
       <p>After careful thought, you decide to use the <quote>Roofways</quote>, as they are your only chance of reaching the King. You have hopped, skipped, and jumped across several streets and you are only one street away from the citadel when you come to the end of a row of rooftops.</p>
       <p>The jump to the next row is much further than anything you have tried before, and your stomach begins to feel as if it were full of butterflies. Determined to reach the citadel, you turn and take a long run-up to the jump. With blood pounding in your ears, you sprint to the edge of the roof and leap into space, your eyes fixed on the opposite rooftop.</p>

Thank the gods that they recognize you, for you must appear a ragged and suspicious figure.

       <p>The pin is an easier task. Slowly it rises out of the lock and falls to the floor. The granite door swings towards you on hidden hinges and the grey half-light of the Graveyard floods into the tomb. The exit is overgrown with graveweed and you suffer many small cuts to your face and hands as you fight your way through to the surface. You are startled by a sudden noise. You turn to see the disembodied head of a corpse laughing at you.</p>
       <p>In blind panic, you race through the eerie necropolis towards the southern gate.</p>

       <p>A war party of Giaks, some twenty-five to thirty strong, are attacking the ruins from all sides. Many more of the Giaks are dead or dying among the broken pillars of marble, but still they assault whatever is hidden inside. Suddenly, a bolt of blue lightning rips through the front rank of Giaks sending the armour-clad creatures tumbling in all directions. A Giak, taller than the others and dressed from head to foot in black chainmail, curses at his troops as he whips them forward with a barbed flail.</p>
       <p>With weapon ready, you move to the edge of the clearing, under cover of the thick foliage, and try to catch a glimpse of the defenders. To your amazement, the ruins are being defended by a young man no older than yourself. You recognize his sky-blue robes, embroidered with stars. He is a young theurgist of the Magicians<ch.apos/> Guild of Toran: an apprentice in magic.</p>

Stretching out towards the west, the River Eledil traces its course from the mountains of the Durncrag Range to the Holmgulf.

       <p>To your right you can see the highway heading off over the rolling plain towards Holmgard. At a run you could reach the outer fieldworks of the city defences in an hour, but you would be in the open for most of the time and vulnerable to attack by Kraan. However, ahead of you, a wide and muddy river drifts sluggishly towards the Eledil. You could use the cover of the river banks and swim towards the capital. Or towards your left lies the Graveyard of the Ancients. These tombs and crumbling monuments to a forgotten age would conceal your approach, but it is a forbidden area. Many are the unnamed horrors that lie there in restless sleep, waiting to consume the unwary trespasser.</p>

       <p>As you get nearer to the men, you call to them. As they turn to face you, your skin turns cold and your heart pounds, for they are Drakkarim in disguise. Suddenly they charge at you. Forced to the ground, you are tied up with ropes and dragged behind them along a track. They take your Backpack and Weapons, but do not search your cloak or find your Gold Crowns. They cackle menacingly to themselves, and talk at great length of the tortures that await you at their camp.</p>

The Kraan takes off and begins to fly across the lake to where you are hidden.</p>

Just as you are about to stop and rest, you see through the trees a line of people moving south along a wide highway.

This could be your chance to reach the capital as quickly as possible.</p>

       <p>Cautiously, you approach the base of the log wall. The tree trunks are rough-hewn and afford plenty of footholds for your climb. As you reach the top of the wall, you come face to face with a crossbow. The soldier holding it in your face motions for you to descend a wooden ladder to the ground. You do not argue with him. Slowly you descend the ladder.</p>

       <p>Lying in the rushing water like a great black dam is a dead Kraan. You creep nearer, under cover of the foliage, until you see three arrows deep in the beast<ch.apos/>s chest. Trapped beneath the beast is the body of its rider. It is a Giak, a spiteful and malicious servant of the Darklords. Many centuries ago, their ancestors were used by the Darklords to build the infernal city of Helgedad, which lies in the volcanic wastelands beyond the Durncrag range of mountains. The construction of the city was a long and torturous nightmare, and only the strongest Giaks survived the heat and poisonous atmospheres of Helgedad. This creature is a descendant of these Giak slaves. It seems that this one must have drowned. The Giak<ch.apos/>s pouch contains 3 Gold Crowns. (You may take these if you wish.)</p>

       <p>You have followed this twisting track for about twenty minutes when you hear the beating of wings high above the trees. Looking up you see a large Kraan approaching from the north, its huge black wings casting a gigantic shadow on the trees below.</p>
       <p>On its back are two creatures armed with long spears. They are Mountain Giaks<ch.emdash/>small ugly creatures full of hatred and malice. Many centuries ago, their ancestors were used by the Darklords to build the infernal city of Helgedad, which lies in the volcanic wastelands beyond the Durncrag mountain range. The construction of the city was long and torturous, and only the strongest of the creatures survived the heat and poisonous atmosphere of Helgedad.</p>
       <p>Quickly you dive for the shelter of a large fern tree as the Kraan passes overhead. With heart pounding, you pray that your quick reactions have saved you from being spotted.</p>

       <p>Surrounded by thorny briars and closely packed roots, you see the entrance of a tunnel disappearing into the hillside beyond. It is approximately seven feet in height and just over ten feet wide. As you get closer, you can feel a slight breeze coming from the inky blackness. If the other end of this tunnel emerges on the far side of the hill, it could save you many hours of difficult climbing. But it could also harbour unknown danger.</p>

Looking up you can just make out the shape of a Kraan approaching from the north. It is one of the monsters that attacked the monastery and on its back are two grey-skinned creatures armed with long spears.</p>
       <p>These are Mountain Giaks<ch.emdash/>evil servants of the Darklords, full of hatred and malice. Many centuries ago, their ancestors were used by the Darklords to build the infernal city of Helgedad, which lies in the volcanic wastelands beyond the Durncrag range of mountains. The construction of the city was long and torturous and only the strongest of the Giaks survived the heat and poisonous atmosphere of Helgedad.</p>
       <p>Hidden by the trees, you freeze, keeping absolutely still as the Kraan passes overhead and disappears towards the south. When you are sure that it has gone, you move off once again into the forest.</p>

       <p>(<a idref="equipmnt">Equipment: How to use your equipment</a>) Added a period to the second from last sentence in the Weapons subsection.

Replaced <quote>at which point the one with the zero score is declared dead.</quote> with <quote>at which point that combatant is declared dead.</quote>.</p>
 
       <p>(<a idref="levels">Levels of Kai Training</a>) The Levels of Kai Training section did not originally appear in this book, but has been added for the reader<ch.apos/>s information.</p>
 
       <p>(<a idref="kaiwisdm">Kai Wisdom</a>) Removed <quote>on the back cover of the book </quote>. Replaced <quote>Lone Wolf</quote> with <quote><cite>Lone Wolf</cite></quote> when referring to the series.</p>

It doesn<ch.apos/>t make sense to skip the section describing the tumble downhill.</p>
       <p>(<a idref="sect18">18</a>) Moved the choice about the Camouflage Discipline into the first position.</p>
       <p>(<a idref="sect19">19</a>) Moved the choice about the Tracking Discipline into the first position. Replaced <quote>Gallowbrush</quote> with <quote>gallowbrush</quote>: you can<ch.apos/>t pick it up.</p>
       <p>(<a idref="sect20">20</a>) Replaced <quote>Jala</quote> with <quote>jala</quote>. Replaced <quote>dagger</quote> with <quote>Dagger</quote>. The original versions of this book had this section lead to <a idref="sect272">Section 272</a>, which is incorrect. We are using the correct section, <a idref="sect273">273</a>, as used in more recent editions.</p>
       <p>(<a idref="sect21">21</a>) The text is unchanged but we have concatenated some of the paragraphs for the dice rolls for clarification. Replaced <quote>on to</quote> with <quote>onto</quote>.</p>
       <p>(<a idref="sect22">22</a>) Added a comma after <quote>0<ch.endash/>4</quote> in the first choice. Replaced <quote>click</quote> with <quote><onomatopoeia>click</onomatopoeia></quote>.</p>
       <p>(<a idref="sect23">23</a>) Reordered the choices. The choice that was originally first (about removing the pin) is now last. The choice about the Golden Key was originally last and is now first. Also added <quote>and wish to use it</quote> after <quote>Golden Key</quote>. Added a period to the end of the illustration<ch.apos/>s caption.</p>
       <p>(<a idref="sect32">32</a>) Replaced <quote>unmistakeable</quote> with <quote>unmistakable</quote>.</p>
       <p>(<a idref="sect33">33</a>) Replaced <quote>fur and</quote> with <quote>fur, and</quote>.</p>
       <p>(<a idref="sect34">34</a>) Added a period to the end of the illustration<ch.apos/>s caption.</p>
       <p>(<a idref="sect36">36</a>) Added a comma after <quote>4 or lower</quote> in the first choice.</p>
       <p>(<a idref="sect37">37</a>) Added a blank line before the decisions and reversed their order.</p>
       <p>(<a idref="sect38">38</a>) Replaced both occurrences of <quote>woodsmoke</quote> with <quote>wood smoke</quote>.</p>
       <p>(<a idref="sect41">41</a>) Added a period to the end of the illustration<ch.apos/>s caption.</p>
       <p>(<a idref="sect46">46</a>) Moved the last choice (about Sixth Sense) into the first position.</p>
       <p>(<a idref="sect51">51</a>) Added a period to the end of the illustration<ch.apos/>s caption.</p>
       <p>(<a idref="sect54">54</a>) Replaced <quote>the last thing you remember are</quote> with <quote>the last thing you remember is</quote>.</p>
       <p>(<a idref="sect57">57</a>) Replaced <quote>liquids and</quote> with <quote>liquids, and</quote>.</p>
       <p>(<a idref="sect58">58</a>) Made the choice that led to <a idref="sect286">Section 286</a> to lead to <a idref="sect251">Section 251</a> instead. Many readers have realized that there was an error here but assumed that the original numbers for the choices should simply be reversed, giving Lone Wolf a chance at survival for hiding and certain death for riding on. Actually, there is no certain death possibility here. Hiding is supposed to grant you certain survival. The proof of this correction is that there is no other path to <a idref="sect251">Section 251</a>, and it works perfectly.</p>
       <p>(<a idref="sect61">61</a>) Replaced <quote>blood-smeared and</quote> with <quote>blood-smeared, and</quote>.</p>
       <p>(<a idref="sect62">62</a>) Replaced <quote>crossbow had</quote> with <quote>crossbow has</quote>. Replaced <quote>west and</quote> with <quote>west, and</quote>.</p>
       <p>(<a idref="sect63">63</a>) Added a period to the end of the illustration<ch.apos/>s caption.</p>
       <p>(<a idref="sect67">67</a>) Made the choice that led to <a idref="sect140">Section 140</a> to lead to <a idref="sect252">Section 252</a> instead. If you read <a idref="sect222">Section 222</a>, you<ch.apos/>ll notice that the choice leading to <a idref="sect252">Section 252</a> is the east track. Indeed, only <a idref="sect140">Section 140</a> may lead you to the bear of which Tracking is supposed to warn you in this section.</p>
       <p>(<a idref="sect69">69</a>) Replaced <quote>Gallowbrush</quote> with <quote>gallowbrush</quote>: you can<ch.apos/>t pick it up.</p>
       <p>(<a idref="sect70">70</a>) Moved the last choice (about Sixth Sense) into the first position.</p>
       <p>(<a idref="sect71">71</a>) Moved the last choice (about Sixth Sense) into the first position.</p>
       <p>(<a idref="sect73">73</a>) Replaced <quote>the Darklords cruellest troops</quote> with <quote>the Darklords<ch.apos/> cruellest troops</quote>.</p>
       <p>(<a idref="sect75">75</a>) Replaced <quote>border rangers</quote> with <quote>Border Rangers</quote>.</p>
       <p>(<a idref="sect76">76</a>) Replaced <quote>slip it into the pocket of your jacket</quote> with <quote>slip this Vordak Gem into your Backpack</quote>. Replaced <quote>horse and</quote> with <quote>horse, and</quote>.</p>
       <p>(<a idref="sect82">82</a>) Replaced <quote>steed and</quote> with <quote>steed, and</quote>.</p>
       <p>(<a idref="sect83">83</a>) Added another <quote>s</quote> after <quote>posses</quote> in the last choice and moved that choice into the first position.</p>
       <p>(<a idref="sect87">87</a>) Replaced <quote>Graveweed</quote> with <quote>graveweed</quote>. Replaced <quote>click</quote> with <quote><onomatopoeia>click</onomatopoeia></quote>.</p>
       <p>(<a idref="sect88">88</a>) Replaced <quote>or do</quote> with <quote>or if you do</quote>. Replaced <quote>my Lord</quote> with <quote>my lord</quote>.</p>
       <p>(<a idref="sect91">91</a>) Moved the last choice (about Sixth Sense) into the first position.</p>
       <p>(<a idref="sect97">97</a>) Added a period to the end of the illustration<ch.apos/>s caption.</p>
       <p>(<a idref="sect105">105</a>) Replaced <quote>jet black</quote> with <quote>jet-black</quote>. Replaced <quote>skill,</quote> with <quote>skill, or if you do not wish to use it,</quote>.</p>
       <p>(<a idref="sect112">112</a>) Replaced <quote>cavemouth</quote> with <quote>cave mouth</quote>.</p>
       <p>(<a idref="sect119">119</a>) Replaced <quote>Gallowbrush</quote> with <quote>gallowbrush</quote>: you can<ch.apos/>t pick it up.</p>
       <p>(<a idref="sect120">120</a>) Replaced <quote>strike, then</quote> with <quote>strike and then</quote>.</p>
       <p>(<a idref="sect121">121</a>) Added a period to the end of the illustration<ch.apos/>s caption.</p>
       <p>(<a idref="sect122">122</a>) Split the first sentence which was actually two independent clauses into two sentences to fix it.</p>
       <p>(<a idref="sect125">125</a>) Moved the last choice (about the Tracking Discipline) into the first position.</p>
       <p>(<a idref="sect128">128</a>) Replaced <quote>border ranger</quote> with <quote>Border Ranger</quote>. Replaced <quote>Durncrag mountains</quote> with <quote>Durncrag Mountains</quote>.</p>
       <p>(<a idref="sect131">131</a>) Replaced <quote>Magicians Guild of Toran</quote> with <quote>Magicians<ch.apos/> Guild of Toran</quote>. Replaced <quote>area, and</quote> with <quote>area and</quote>.</p>
       <p>(<a idref="sect132">132</a>) Replaced <quote>sumptuous Meal</quote> with <quote>sumptuous meal</quote>.</p>
       <p>(<a idref="sect137">137</a>) Replaced <quote>20 Gems</quote> with <quote>20 Tomb Guardian Gems</quote> and <quote>mark these on your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a></quote> with <quote>mark these on your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a> as a single Backpack Item</quote> based on changes made to the Collector<ch.apos/>s Edition.</p>
       <p>(<a idref="sect142">142</a>) Replaced <quote>Durncrag range</quote> with <quote>Durncrag Range</quote>.</p>
       <p>(<a idref="sect144">144</a>) Added <quote> or if you have no Backpack Items</quote> to the second paragraph. Replaced <quote>one Item is stolen</quote> with <quote>one item is stolen</quote>. Added a period to the end of the illustration<ch.apos/>s caption.</p>
       <p>(<a idref="sect151">151</a>) Added <quote>If you wish to remove the pin, <!--link-text-->turn to 337<!--/link-text-->.</quote> This is the only other possible choice for what is a strangely one-sided option in the original text. More flavourful language might make more sense, such as <quote>If you still wish to remove the pin with your hands,</quote> but to best preserve the integrity of the text, we simply copied the choice from <a idref="sect23">Section 23</a>.</p>
       <p>(<a idref="sect152">152</a>) Added a period to the end of the illustration<ch.apos/>s caption.</p>
       <p>(<a idref="sect153">153</a>) Replaced <quote>Durncrag range</quote> with <quote>Durncrag Range</quote>.</p>
       <p>(<a idref="sect154">154</a>) Replaced <quote>head first</quote> with <quote>head-first</quote>. Replaced <quote>last thing you feel are the black shafts</quote> with <quote>last thing you feel is the black shafts</quote>.</p>
       <p>(<a idref="sect163">163</a>) Replaced <quote>nearly an half</quote> with <quote>nearly half</quote>.</p>
       <p>(<a idref="sect166">166</a>) Replaced <quote>tortuous</quote> with <quote>torturous</quote>.</p>
       <p>(<a idref="sect167">167</a>) Moved the last choice (about Sixth Sense) into the first position.</p>
       <p>(<a idref="sect170">170</a>) Added a period to the end of the illustration<ch.apos/>s caption.</p>
       <p>(<a idref="sect172">172</a>) Moved the second choice (about the Camouflage Discipline) into the first position.</p>
       <p>(<a idref="sect175">175</a>) Moved the last choice (about the Camouflage Discipline) into the first position. Replaced <quote>border rangers</quote> with <quote>Border Rangers</quote>.</p>
       <p>(<a idref="sect181">181</a>) Removed <quote>You have lost your Weapons and Equipment, but not your life.</quote> from the end of the second paragraph because it is possible to reach this section of the book without having lost your equipment.</p>
       <p>(<a idref="sect184">184</a>) Replaced <quote>Sword and</quote> with <quote>Sword, and</quote>.</p>
       <p>(<a idref="sect192">192</a>) Replaced <quote>Kraan, and</quote> with <quote>Kraan and</quote>.</p>
       <p>(<a idref="sect197">197</a>) Removed a superfluous space after the word <quote>wish</quote> at the very end of the second sentence.</p>
       <p>(<a idref="sect196">196</a>) Replaced <quote>click</quote> with <quote><onomatopoeia>click</onomatopoeia></quote>.</p>
       <p>(<a idref="sect200">200</a>) Reversed the order of the choices. Added a period to the end of the illustration<ch.apos/>s caption.</p>
       <p>(<a idref="sect201">201</a>) Changed the choice that led to <a idref="sect215">Section 215</a> to lead to <a idref="sect15">Section 15</a> instead. The original choice appears to make sense, but does not work out in a map. The indication that the correct section is really <a idref="sect15">15</a> is the fact that it is not otherwise accessible (though <a idref="sect215">Section 215</a> is) and <a idref="sect15">15</a> leads back to <a idref="sect201">Section 201</a> when taking the opposite direction.</p>
       <p>(<a idref="sect205">205</a>) Added <quote>(You must now erase all Weapons and Backpack Items from your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>.)</quote> in harmony with the Collector<ch.apos/>s Edition. Replaced <quote>click</quote> with <quote><onomatopoeia>click</onomatopoeia></quote>.</p>
       <p>(<a idref="sect211">211</a>) Moved the second choice (about Sixth Sense) into the first position.</p>
       <p>(<a idref="sect212">212</a>) Added a period to the end of the illustration<ch.apos/>s caption.</p>
       <p>(<a idref="sect218">218</a>) Replaced <quote>war cries</quote> with <quote>war-cries</quote>.</p>
       <p>(<a idref="sect221">221</a>) Replaced <quote>rough hewn</quote> with <quote>rough-hewn</quote>.</p>
       <p>(<a idref="sect222">222</a>) Moved the last choice (about Tracking) into the first position.</p>
       <p>(<a idref="sect226">226</a>) Replaced <quote>head first</quote> with <quote>head-first</quote>.</p>
       <p>(<a idref="sect228">228</a>) Replaced <quote>axe</quote> with <quote>weapon</quote> because another weapon is available in <a idref="sect305">Section 305</a>. Replaced <quote>dense, and</quote> with <quote>dense and</quote>.</p>
       <p>(<a idref="sect235">235</a>) Moved the last choice (about Tracking) into the first position.</p>
       <p>(<a idref="sect236">236</a>) Added <quote>(Remember to erase the Vordak Gem from your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>. If you had two Gems, you need erase only one.)</quote>.</p>
       <p>(<a idref="sect246">246</a>) Added a period to the end of the illustration<ch.apos/>s caption.</p>
       <p>(<a idref="sect252">252</a>) Replaced <quote>men and</quote> with <quote>men, and</quote>.</p>
       <p>(<a idref="sect254">254</a>) Replaced <quote>Durncrag mountains</quote> with <quote>Durncrag Mountains</quote>.</p>
       <p>(<a idref="sect260">260</a>) Replaced <quote>spreadeagled</quote> with <quote>spread-eagled</quote>.</p>
       <p>(<a idref="sect267">267</a>) Capitalized <quote>message</quote> in the second sentence of the second paragraph, since that is how retrievable items are supposed to be represented, and to be consistent with the first time the item is mentioned in this section. Added a period to the end of the illustration<ch.apos/>s caption.</p>
       <p>(<a idref="sect268">268</a>) Replaced <quote>wary</quote> with <quote>weary</quote>. We hardly think Lone Wolf would be wary among the King<ch.apos/>s soldiers.</p>
       <p>(<a idref="sect272">272</a>) Replaced <quote>wood-smoke</quote> with <quote>wood smoke</quote>.</p>
