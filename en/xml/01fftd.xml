    <p>In the northern land of Sommerlund, it has been the custom for many centuries to send the children of the Warrior Lords to the monastery of Kai. There they are taught the skills and disciplines of their noble fathers.</p>
    <p>The Kai monks are masters of their art, and the children in their charge love and respect them in spite of the hardships of their training. For one day when they have finally learnt the secret skills of the Kai, they will return to their homes equipped in mind and body to defend themselves against the constant threat of war from the Darklords of the west.</p>
    <p>In olden times, during the Age of the Black Moon, the Darklords waged war on Sommerlund. The conflict was a long and bitter trial of strength that ended in victory for the Sommlending at the great battle of Maakengorge. King Ulnar and the allies of Durenor broke the Darkland armies at the pass of Moytura and forced them back into the bottomless abyss of Maakengorge. Vashna, mightiest of the Darklords, was slain upon the sword of King Ulnar, called <quote>Sommerswerd</quote>, the sword of the sun. Since that age, the Darklords have vowed vengeance upon Sommerlund and the House of Ulnar.</p>
    <p>Now it is in the morning of the feast of Fehmarn, when all of the Kai Lords are present at the monastery for the celebrations. Suddenly a great black cloud comes from out of the western skies. So many are the numbers of the black-winged beasts that fill the sky, that the sun is completely hidden. The Darklords, ancient enemy of the Sommlending, are attacking. War has begun.</p>
    <p>On this fateful morning, you, Silent Wolf (the name given to you by the Kai) have been sent to collect firewood in the forest as a punishment for your inattention in class. As you are preparing to return, you see to your horror a vast cloud of black leathery creatures swoop down and engulf the monastery.</p>
    <p>Dropping the wood, you race to the battle that has already begun. But in the unnatural dark, you stumble and strike your head on a low tree branch. As you lose consciousness, the last thing that you see in the poor light is the walls of the monastery crashing to the ground.</p>
    <p>Many hours pass before you awake. With tears in your eyes you now survey the scene of destruction. Raising your face to the clear sky, you swear vengeance on the Darklords for the massacre of the Kai warriors, and with a sudden flash of realization you know what you must do. You must set off on a perilous journey to the capital city to warn the King of the terrible threat that now faces his people. For you are now the last of the Kai<ch.emdash/>you are now the Lone Wolf.</p>

   <data>
    <p>You keep a record of your adventure on the <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
    <p>During your training as a Kai Lord you have developed fighting prowess<ch.emdash/><typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> and physical stamina<ch.emdash/><typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ>. Before you set off on your adventure you need to measure how effective your training has been. To do this take a pencil and, with your eyes closed, point with the blunt end of it onto the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a>. If you pick 0 it counts as zero.</p>
    <p>The first number that you pick from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> in this way represents your <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ>. Add 10 to the number you picked and write the total in the <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> section of your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a> (i.e. if your pencil fell on the number 4 in the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> you would write in a <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> of 14). When you fight, your <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> will be pitted against that of your enemy. A high score in this section is therefore very desirable.</p>
    <p>The second number that you pick from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> represents your powers of <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ>. Add 20 to this number and write the total in the <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> section of your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a> (i.e. if your pencil fell on the number 6 on the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> you would have 26 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points).</p>
    <p>If you are wounded in combat you will lose <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points. If at any time your <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points fall to zero or below, you are dead and the adventure is over. Lost <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points can be regained during the course of the adventure, but your number of <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points can never go above the number with which you start your adventure.</p>

      <p>Over the centuries, the Kai monks have mastered the skills of the warrior. These skills are known as the Kai Disciplines, and they are taught to all Kai Lords. You have learnt only five of the skills listed below. The choice of which five skills these are, is for you to make. As all of the Disciplines may be of use to you at some point on your perilous quest, pick your five with care. The correct use of a Discipline at the right time can save your life.</p>
      <p>When you have chosen your five Disciplines, enter them in the Kai Disciplines section of your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>.</p>

       <data>
        <p>This Discipline enables a Kai Lord to blend in with his surroundings. In the countryside, he can hide undetected among trees and rocks and pass close to an enemy without being seen. In a town or city, it enables him to look and sound like a native of that area, and can help him to find shelter or a safe hiding place.</p>
        <p>If you choose this skill, write <quote>Camouflage</quote> on your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>.</p>

       <data>
        <p>Upon entering the Kai Monastery, each initiate is taught to master one type of weapon. If Weaponskill is to be one of your Kai Disciplines, pick a number in the usual way from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a>, and then find the corresponding weapon from the list below. This is the weapon in which you have skill. When you enter combat carrying this weapon, you add 2 points to your <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ>.</p>
        <p>The fact that you are skilled with a weapon does not mean you set out on the adventure carrying that particular weapon. However, you will have opportunities to acquire weapons in the course of your adventures. If you pick the axe, you are lucky enough to be skilled in the one weapon Lone Wolf is carrying from the start of the adventure. (This will be explained fully in the <a idref="equipmnt">Equipment section</a>.)</p>

      <p>There will be occasions on your adventure when you have to fight an enemy. The enemy<ch.apos/>s <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> and <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points are given in the text. Lone Wolf<ch.apos/>s aim in the combat is to kill the enemy by reducing his <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points to zero while losing as few <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points as possible himself.</p>
      <p>At the start of a combat, enter Lone Wolf<ch.apos/>s and the enemy<ch.apos/>s <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points in the appropriate boxes on the Combat Record section of your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
      <p>The sequence for combat is as follows.</p>
      <ol class="paragraphed">
       <li><p>Add any extra points gained through your Kai Disciplines to your current <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> total.</p></li>
       <li>
        <p>Subtract the <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> of your enemy from this total. The result is your Combat Ratio. Enter it on the <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
        <p>Example</p>
        <p>Lone Wolf (<typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> 15) is ambushed by a Winged Devil (<typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> 20). He is not given the opportunity to evade combat, but must stand and fight as the creature swoops down on him. Lone Wolf has the Kai Discipline of Mindblast, so he adds 2 points to his <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ>, giving a total <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> of 17.</p>
        <p>He subtracts the Winged Devil<ch.apos/>s <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> from his own, giving a Combat Ratio of <ch.minus/>3 (17 <ch.minus/> 20 = <ch.minus/>3). <ch.minus/>3 is noted on the <a idref="action">Action Chart</a> as the Combat Ratio.</p>
       </li>
       <li><p><a id="stage3">When you have your Combat Ratio</a>, pick a number from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a>.</p></li>
       <li>
        <p>Turn to the <a idref="crtable">Combat Results Table</a>. Along the top of the chart are shown the Combat Ratio numbers. Find the number that is the same as your Combat Ratio and cross-reference it with the random number that you have picked (the random numbers appear on the side of the chart). You now have the number of <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points lost by both Lone Wolf and his enemy in this round of combat. (E represents points lost by the enemy; LW represents points lost by Lone Wolf.)</p>
        <p>Example</p>
        <p>The Combat Ratio between Lone Wolf and Winged Devil has been established as <ch.minus/>3. If the number taken from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> is a 6, then the result of the first round of combat is:</p>
        <ul>
         <li>Lone Wolf loses 3 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points</li>
         <li>Winged Devil loses 6 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points</li>
        </ul>
       </li>
       <li><p>On the <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>, mark the changes in <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points to the participants in the combat.</p></li>
       <li><p>Unless otherwise instructed, or unless you have an option to evade, the next round of combat now starts.</p></li>
       <li><p>Repeat the sequence from <a idref="stage3">Stage 3</a>.</p></li>
      </ol>
      <p>This process of combat continues until the <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points of either the enemy or Lone Wolf are reduced to zero or below, at which point that combatant is declared dead. If Lone Wolf is dead, the adventure is over. If the enemy is dead, Lone Wolf proceeds but with his <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points possibly reduced.</p>

Only Lone Wolf may lose <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points during that round, but then that is the risk of running away!

    <p>Your mission will be one of great danger, for the Darklords and their servants are a cruel and fierce enemy who give and expect no mercy. Use the <a idref="map">map</a> to help you steer a correct course for the capital. Make notes as you progress through the story, for they will be of great help in future adventures.</p>
    <p>Many things that you find will aid you during the adventure. Some Special Items will be of use in future <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> adventures and others may be red herrings of no real use at all, so be selective in what you decide to keep.</p>
    <p>There are many routes to the King, but only one involves a minimum of danger. With a wise choice of Kai Disciplines and a great deal of courage, any player should be able to complete the mission, no matter how weak their initial <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> or <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points score.</p>

      <p>The houses and buildings of the capital are built very close to each other, and it is possible to jump from one roof to the next. In fact many of the citizens of Holmgard used to use the <quote>Roofways</quote> (as they are known) when the heavy autumn rains made the unpaved parts of the streets too muddy for walking.

Pulling your cloak around you to blend into the dense bracken, you dash through the forest and away from the hidden ambushers as fast as possible. This entire area is infested by Giaks and you must escape as quickly as you can. You run without rest for over an hour until you happen to fall upon a straight forest path heading towards the east. You follow the path, taking care to keep watch for signs of the enemy.</p>

      <p>After a few minutes walking you see a stranger, clad in red, standing in the centre of the track ahead. He has his back towards you, and his head is covered by the hood of his robes. Perched on his outstretched arm is the black raven that you saw earlier.</p>

      <p>You have covered about a quarter of a mile when you hear shouting and a noise like thunderclaps ahead. Edging nearer, you soon make out a clearing that you recognize to be the site of the ruins of Raumas, an ancient forest temple.</p>
      <p>A war party of Giaks, some twenty-five to thirty strong, are attacking the ruins from all sides. Many more of the Giaks are dead or dying among the broken pillars of marble, but still they assault whatever is hidden inside. Suddenly, a bolt of blue lightning rips through the front rank of Giaks sending the armour-clad creatures tumbling in all directions. A Giak, taller than the others and dressed from head to foot in black chainmail, curses at his troops as he whips them forward with a barbed flail.</p>
      <p>With weapon ready, you move to the edge of the clearing, under cover of the thick foliage, and try to catch a glimpse of the defenders. To your amazement, the ruins are being defended by a young man no older than yourself. You recognize his sky-blue robes, embroidered with stars. He is a young theurgist of the Magicians<ch.apos/> Guild of Toran: an apprentice in magic.</p>

Stretching out towards the west, the River Eledil traces its course from the mountains of the Durncrag Range to the Holmgulf. But from below the mountain peaks you can see a vast black army marching relentlessly on towards the city.</p>
      <p>To your right you can see the highway heading off over the rolling plain towards Holmgard. At a run you could reach the outer fieldworks of the city defences in an hour, but you would be in the open for most of the time and vulnerable to attack by Kraan. However, ahead of you, a wide and muddy river drifts sluggishly towards the Eledil. You could use the cover of the river banks and swim towards the capital. Or towards your left lies the Graveyard of the Ancients. These tombs and crumbling monuments to a forgotten age would conceal your approach, but it is a forbidden area. Many are the unnamed horrors that lie there in restless sleep, waiting to consume the unwary trespasser.</p>

      <p>The herbalist offers you a selection of special potions. Some increase your strength; some induce invisibility; some give you great powers of stealth; and others give you the power of turning yourself into a gaseous form. The man pulls open the bottom drawer of the counter to reveal a magnificent wand. He says that it is a powerful weapon against all evil creatures, and that it will make you invulnerable in battle. He points to the mystical inscriptions which cover the black staff.</p>

      <p>Before you are the tall grey-white walls and glimmering spires of Holmgard, the city<ch.apos/>s banners fluttering from the battlements in the fresh morning breeze. Stretching out towards the west, the River Eledil traces its course from the mountains of the Durncrag Range to the Holmgulf. But below the mountain peaks you can see a vast black army marching relentlessly on towards the capital.</p>

      <p>To your right you can see the highway heading off over the rolling plain towards Holmgard. At a gallop you could make the outer fieldworks of the city<ch.apos/>s defences in less than an hour, but you would be in the open for most of the time and vulnerable to attack by Kraan. Directly ahead of you, a wide river drifts sluggishly towards the Eledil. If you abandoned your horse, you could swim towards the outer defences under cover of the river banks. Or there is a final alternative. To your left lies the Graveyard of the Ancients. These tombs and crumbling monuments to a forgotten age would conceal your approach but it is a forbidden area. Many are the unnamed horrors that lie there in restless sleep, waiting to consume the unwary trespasser.</p>

      <p>Night falls and you are soon engulfed in darkness. To press on any further would be futile, for you would be sure to lose your way. Tethering your horse to a tree, you pull your green Kai cloak about you and fall into a restless sleep.</p>
      <p>You are awoken by the sound of troops in the distance. Across the lake you see the black shapes of Drakkarim and a pack of Doomwolves. A Kraan appears from above the trees and lands on the roof of the small wooden shack. It is being ridden by a creature dressed in red robes. The Kraan takes off and begins to fly across the lake to where you are hidden.</p>

It is a Giak, a spiteful and ghoulish servant of the Darklords. Many centuries ago, their ancestors were used by the Darklords to build for them the infernal city of Helgedad, which lies in the volcanic wastelands beyond the Durncrag range of mountains. The construction of the city was a long and torturous nightmare, and only the strongest of the Giaks survived the heat and poisonous atmospheres of Helgedad. This creature that lies before you is a descendant of these Giak slaves. It has been killed by a sword blow to its head, and by its side lies a Mace. You may take this Weapon if you wish.</p>

      <p>Carefully, you follow the stream as it makes its way towards the east. Suddenly you notice something in the distance that brings you to a halt.</p>
      <p>Lying in the rushing water like a great black dam is a dead Kraan. You creep nearer, under cover of the foliage, until you see three arrows deep in the beast<ch.apos/>s chest. Trapped beneath the beast is the body of its rider. It is a Giak, a spiteful and malicious servant of the Darklords. Many centuries ago, their ancestors were used by the Darklords to build the infernal city of Helgedad, which lies in the volcanic wastelands beyond the Durncrag range of mountains. The construction of the city was a long and torturous nightmare, and only the strongest Giaks survived the heat and poisonous atmospheres of Helgedad. This creature is a descendant of these Giak slaves. It seems that this one must have drowned. The Giak<ch.apos/>s pouch contains 3 Gold Crowns. (You may take these if you wish.)</p>

      <p>Slowly sitting upright, you notice that you are still wearing your belt<ch.emdash/>you had not lost it after all. What you grabbed from the jaw of the Burrowcrawler was a leather strap with a small pouch and a sheathed Dagger halfway along it. You break open the clasp to find it contains 20 Gold Crowns. You may take both the Dagger and the Crowns if you are able to.</p>
      <p>Feeling a little better now, you gather your Equipment together and push on eastwards into the forest.</p>

      <p>The trees start to thin out, and just ahead you can make out the silhouette of an old log cabin beneath an oak tree. This hut seems to have been abandoned and there is little of apparent value left behind. Opening a small chest near the main door, you discover bunches of twigs that have been tied together with strong twine. One end of each bundle has been coated with pitch. They are Torches. Next to the chest are a Short Sword and a Tinderbox. You may take them and a Torch if you wish but make sure that you mark them on your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>.<footref id="sect347-1" idref="sect347-1-foot"/></p>
      <p>Closing the door of the cabin, you head off along an overgrown path towards the northeast.</p>

      <p>He is a young blond-haired youth with deep brooding eyes. His face is lined with exhaustion and the grime of battle, and his long sky-blue robes bear evidence of living rough in the wilds. He shakes your hand and bows. <quote>My eternal thanks, Kai Lord. My powers are nearly drained. Had you not come to my aid, I fear I would have ended my days atop a Giak lance.</quote></p>
      <p>He is weak and unsteady on his feet. You take his arm and sit him down upon a fallen pillar where you listen intently to what he has to say.</p>
      <p><quote>My name is Banedon. I am journeyman to the Brotherhood of the Crystal Star, which is the Magicians<ch.apos/> Guild of Toran. My Guildmaster has sent me to your monastery with this urgent message.</quote> He removes a vellum envelope from inside his robes and hands it to you.</p>
      <p><quote>As you see, I have opened the letter and read its contents. When the war started, I was on the highway with two travelling companions. The Kraan attacked us and we lost each other in the forest during our escape.</quote></p>
      <p>The letter is a warning to the Kai Lords that the Darklords have mustered a vast army beyond the Durncrag Range. The Guildmaster urges the Kai to cancel the celebrations of Fehmarn and prepare for war.</p>
      <p><quote>I fear we were betrayed,</quote> says Banedon, his head bowed in sorrow.</p>
      <p><quote>One of my order, a brother called Vonotar, had explored the forbidden mysteries of the Black Art. Ten days ago he denounced the Brotherhood and killed one of our Elders. He has since disappeared. It is rumoured that he now aids the Darklords.</quote></p>
      <p>You tell Banedon what has happened at the monastery, and of your mission to warn the King. Silently, he removes a gold chain from around his neck and hands it to you. On the chain is a small Crystal Star Pendant. <quote>It is the symbol of my Brotherhood, and we are both truly brothers in this hour of darkness. It is a talisman of good fortune<ch.emdash/>may it protect you on your road ahead.</quote></p>
      <p>You thank him, place the chain around your neck, and slip the Crystal Star<footref id="sect349-1" idref="sect349-1-foot"/> inside your shirt. (Remember to mark this on your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>.)</p>
      <p>Banedon bids you farewell. <quote>We must leave this place lest the Giaks return with more of their loathsome kind to put an end to us. I must return to my Guild. I bid you farewell, my brother. May the luck of the gods go with you.</quote></p>

The King and his closest advisers are studying a large map spread upon a marble plinth in the centre of the chamber. Their faces are lined with worry and concentration. A silence fills the hall as you tell of the death of your kinsmen and of your perilous journey to the citadel. As you finish your story, the King approaches and takes your right hand in his.</p>

      <p><quote>Lone Wolf, you have selfless courage: the quality of a true Kai Lord. Your journey here has been one of great peril and although your news comes as a grievous blow, the spirit of your determination is like a beacon of hope to us all in this dark hour. You have brought great honour to the memory of your Masters, and for that we praise you.</quote></p>
      <p>You receive the praise and heartfelt thanks of the entire hall<ch.emdash/>an honour that brings a certain redness to your young face. The King raises his hand and all the voices cease.</p>
      <p><quote>You have done all that Sommerlund could have asked of a loyal son, but she is greatly in need of you still. The Darklords are powerful once more and their ambition knows no bounds. Our only hope lies within Durenor with the power that once defeated the Darklords an age ago. Lone Wolf, you are the last of the Kai<ch.emdash/>you have the skills. Will you journey to Durenor and return with the Sommerswerd, the sword of the sun? Only with that gift of the gods may we crush this evil and save our land.</quote></p>

      <p>(<a idref="equipmnt">Equipment</a>) Added periods to the sentences describing the Helmet and Chainmail Waistcoat.</p>

      <p>(<a idref="equipmnt">Equipment: How to use your equipment</a>) Added a period to the second from last sentence in the Weapons subsection.

Added <quote>You may only use one Weapon at a time in combat.</quote> in harmony with the Collector<ch.apos/>s Edition. Added <quote>It cannot be used to increase <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points immediately prior to a combat.</quote> in harmony with the Collector<ch.apos/>s Edition.</p>

      <p>(<a idref="cmbtrulz">Rules for Combat</a>) Removed a superfluous period in the second paragraph of the first example. Removed <quote> on the inside back cover of the book</quote>.

Replaced <quote>at which point the one with the zero score is declared dead.</quote> with <quote>at which point that combatant is declared dead.</quote>.</p>

      <p>(<a idref="levels">Levels of Kai Training</a>) The Levels of Kai Training section did not originally appear in this book, but has been added for the reader<ch.apos/>s information.</p>

      <p>(<a idref="sect17">17</a>) Changed the last choice that led to <a idref="sect331">Section 331</a> to lead to <a idref="sect316">Section 316</a> instead in order to parallel <a idref="sect89">Section 89</a>. It doesn<ch.apos/>t make sense to skip the section describing the tumble downhill.</p>
      <p>(<a idref="sect18">18</a>) Moved the choice about the Camouflage Discipline into the first position.</p>
      <p>(<a idref="sect19">19</a>) Moved the choice about the Tracking Discipline into the first position. Replaced <quote>Gallowbrush</quote> with <quote>gallowbrush</quote>: you can<ch.apos/>t pick it up.</p>
      <p>(<a idref="sect20">20</a>) Replaced <quote>Jala</quote> with <quote>jala</quote>. Replaced <quote>dagger</quote> with <quote>Dagger</quote>. The original versions of this book had this section lead to <a idref="sect272">Section 272</a>, which is incorrect. We are using the correct section, <a idref="sect273">273</a>, as used in more recent editions.</p>
      <p>(<a idref="sect21">21</a>) The text is unchanged but we have concatenated some of the paragraphs for the dice rolls for clarification. Replaced <quote>on to</quote> with <quote>onto</quote>.</p>
      <p>(<a idref="sect22">22</a>) Added a comma after <quote>0<ch.endash/>4</quote> in the first choice. Replaced <quote>click</quote> with <quote><onomatopoeia>click</onomatopoeia></quote>.</p>
      <p>(<a idref="sect23">23</a>) Reordered the choices. The choice that was originally first (about removing the pin) is now last. The choice about the Golden Key was originally last and is now first. Also added <quote>and wish to use it</quote> after <quote>Golden Key</quote>. Added a period to the end of the illustration<ch.apos/>s caption.</p>
      <p>(<a idref="sect32">32</a>) Replaced <quote>unmistakeable</quote> with <quote>unmistakable</quote>.</p>
      <p>(<a idref="sect33">33</a>) Replaced <quote>fur and</quote> with <quote>fur, and</quote>.</p>
      <p>(<a idref="sect34">34</a>) Added a period to the end of the illustration<ch.apos/>s caption.</p>
      <p>(<a idref="sect36">36</a>) Added a comma after <quote>4 or lower</quote> in the first choice.</p>
      <p>(<a idref="sect37">37</a>) Added a blank line before the decisions and reversed their order.</p>
      <p>(<a idref="sect38">38</a>) Replaced both occurrences of <quote>woodsmoke</quote> with <quote>wood smoke</quote>.</p>
      <p>(<a idref="sect41">41</a>) Added a period to the end of the illustration<ch.apos/>s caption.</p>
      <p>(<a idref="sect46">46</a>) Moved the last choice (about Sixth Sense) into the first position.</p>
      <p>(<a idref="sect51">51</a>) Added a period to the end of the illustration<ch.apos/>s caption.</p>
      <p>(<a idref="sect54">54</a>) Replaced <quote>the last thing you remember are</quote> with <quote>the last thing you remember is</quote>.</p>
      <p>(<a idref="sect57">57</a>) Replaced <quote>liquids and</quote> with <quote>liquids, and</quote>.</p>
      <p>(<a idref="sect58">58</a>) Made the choice that led to <a idref="sect286">Section 286</a> to lead to <a idref="sect251">Section 251</a> instead. Many readers have realized that there was an error here but assumed that the original numbers for the choices should simply be reversed, giving Lone Wolf a chance at survival for hiding and certain death for riding on. Actually, there is no certain death possibility here. Hiding is supposed to grant you certain survival. The proof of this correction is that there is no other path to <a idref="sect251">Section 251</a>, and it works perfectly.</p>
      <p>(<a idref="sect61">61</a>) Replaced <quote>blood-smeared and</quote> with <quote>blood-smeared, and</quote>.</p>
      <p>(<a idref="sect62">62</a>) Replaced <quote>crossbow had</quote> with <quote>crossbow has</quote>. Replaced <quote>west and</quote> with <quote>west, and</quote>.</p>
      <p>(<a idref="sect63">63</a>) Added a period to the end of the illustration<ch.apos/>s caption.</p>
      <p>(<a idref="sect67">67</a>) Made the choice that led to <a idref="sect140">Section 140</a> to lead to <a idref="sect252">Section 252</a> instead. If you read <a idref="sect222">Section 222</a>, you<ch.apos/>ll notice that the choice leading to <a idref="sect252">Section 252</a> is the east track. Indeed, only <a idref="sect140">Section 140</a> may lead you to the bear of which Tracking is supposed to warn you in this section.</p>
      <p>(<a idref="sect69">69</a>) Replaced <quote>Gallowbrush</quote> with <quote>gallowbrush</quote>: you can<ch.apos/>t pick it up.</p>
      <p>(<a idref="sect70">70</a>) Moved the last choice (about Sixth Sense) into the first position.</p>
      <p>(<a idref="sect71">71</a>) Moved the last choice (about Sixth Sense) into the first position.</p>
      <p>(<a idref="sect73">73</a>) Replaced <quote>the Darklords cruellest troops</quote> with <quote>the Darklords<ch.apos/> cruellest troops</quote>.</p>
      <p>(<a idref="sect75">75</a>) Replaced <quote>border rangers</quote> with <quote>Border Rangers</quote>.</p>
      <p>(<a idref="sect76">76</a>) Replaced <quote>slip it into the pocket of your jacket</quote> with <quote>slip this Vordak Gem into your Backpack</quote>. Replaced <quote>horse and</quote> with <quote>horse, and</quote>.</p>
      <p>(<a idref="sect82">82</a>) Replaced <quote>steed and</quote> with <quote>steed, and</quote>.</p>
      <p>(<a idref="sect83">83</a>) Added another <quote>s</quote> after <quote>posses</quote> in the last choice and moved that choice into the first position.</p>
      <p>(<a idref="sect87">87</a>) Replaced <quote>Graveweed</quote> with <quote>graveweed</quote>. Replaced <quote>click</quote> with <quote><onomatopoeia>click</onomatopoeia></quote>.</p>
      <p>(<a idref="sect88">88</a>) Replaced <quote>or do</quote> with <quote>or if you do</quote>. Replaced <quote>my Lord</quote> with <quote>my lord</quote>.</p>
      <p>(<a idref="sect91">91</a>) Moved the last choice (about Sixth Sense) into the first position.</p>
      <p>(<a idref="sect97">97</a>) Added a period to the end of the illustration<ch.apos/>s caption.</p>
      <p>(<a idref="sect105">105</a>) Replaced <quote>jet black</quote> with <quote>jet-black</quote>. Replaced <quote>skill,</quote> with <quote>skill, or if you do not wish to use it,</quote>.</p>
      <p>(<a idref="sect112">112</a>) Replaced <quote>cavemouth</quote> with <quote>cave mouth</quote>.</p>
      <p>(<a idref="sect119">119</a>) Replaced <quote>Gallowbrush</quote> with <quote>gallowbrush</quote>: you can<ch.apos/>t pick it up.</p>
      <p>(<a idref="sect120">120</a>) Replaced <quote>strike, then</quote> with <quote>strike and then</quote>.</p>
      <p>(<a idref="sect121">121</a>) Added a period to the end of the illustration<ch.apos/>s caption.</p>
      <p>(<a idref="sect122">122</a>) Split the first sentence which was actually two independent clauses into two sentences to fix it.</p>
      <p>(<a idref="sect125">125</a>) Moved the last choice (about the Tracking Discipline) into the first position.</p>
      <p>(<a idref="sect128">128</a>) Replaced <quote>border ranger</quote> with <quote>Border Ranger</quote>. Replaced <quote>Durncrag mountains</quote> with <quote>Durncrag Mountains</quote>.</p>
      <p>(<a idref="sect131">131</a>) Replaced <quote>Magicians Guild of Toran</quote> with <quote>Magicians<ch.apos/> Guild of Toran</quote>. Replaced <quote>area, and</quote> with <quote>area and</quote>.</p>
      <p>(<a idref="sect132">132</a>) Replaced <quote>sumptuous Meal</quote> with <quote>sumptuous meal</quote>.</p>
      <p>(<a idref="sect137">137</a>) Replaced <quote>20 Gems</quote> with <quote>20 Tomb Guardian Gems</quote> and <quote>mark these on your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a></quote> with <quote>mark these on your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a> as a single Backpack Item</quote> based on changes made to the Collector<ch.apos/>s Edition.</p>
      <p>(<a idref="sect142">142</a>) Replaced <quote>Durncrag range</quote> with <quote>Durncrag Range</quote>.</p>
      <p>(<a idref="sect144">144</a>) Added <quote> or if you have no Backpack Items</quote> to the second paragraph. Replaced <quote>one Item is stolen</quote> with <quote>one item is stolen</quote>. Added a period to the end of the illustration<ch.apos/>s caption.</p>
      <p>(<a idref="sect151">151</a>) Added <quote>If you wish to remove the pin, <!--link-text-->turn to 337<!--/link-text-->.</quote> This is the only other possible choice for what is a strangely one-sided option in the original text. More flavourful language might make more sense, such as <quote>If you still wish to remove the pin with your hands,</quote> but to best preserve the integrity of the text, we simply copied the choice from <a idref="sect23">Section 23</a>.</p>
      <p>(<a idref="sect152">152</a>) Added a period to the end of the illustration<ch.apos/>s caption.</p>
      <p>(<a idref="sect153">153</a>) Replaced <quote>Durncrag range</quote> with <quote>Durncrag Range</quote>.</p>

      <p>(<a idref="sect166">166</a>) Replaced <quote>tortuous</quote> with <quote>torturous</quote>.</p>
      <p>(<a idref="sect167">167</a>) Moved the last choice (about Sixth Sense) into the first position.</p>
      <p>(<a idref="sect170">170</a>) Added a period to the end of the illustration<ch.apos/>s caption.</p>
      <p>(<a idref="sect172">172</a>) Moved the second choice (about the Camouflage Discipline) into the first position.</p>
      <p>(<a idref="sect175">175</a>) Moved the last choice (about the Camouflage Discipline) into the first position. Replaced <quote>border rangers</quote> with <quote>Border Rangers</quote>.</p>
      <p>(<a idref="sect181">181</a>) Removed <quote>You have lost your Weapons and Equipment, but not your life.</quote> from the end of the second paragraph because it is possible to reach this section of the book without having lost your equipment.</p>
      <p>(<a idref="sect184">184</a>) Replaced <quote>Sword and</quote> with <quote>Sword, and</quote>.</p>

The original choice appears to make sense, but does not work out in a map. The indication that the correct section is really <a idref="sect15">15</a> is the fact that it is not otherwise accessible (though <a idref="sect215">Section 215</a> is) and <a idref="sect15">15</a> leads back to <a idref="sect201">Section 201</a> when taking the opposite direction.</p>
      <p>(<a idref="sect205">205</a>) Added <quote>(You must now erase all Weapons and Backpack Items from your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>.)</quote> in harmony with the Collector<ch.apos/>s Edition. Replaced <quote>click</quote> with <quote><onomatopoeia>click</onomatopoeia></quote>.</p>

      <p>(<a idref="sect235">235</a>) Moved the last choice (about Tracking) into the first position.</p>
      <p>(<a idref="sect236">236</a>) Added <quote>(Remember to erase the Vordak Gem from your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>. If you had two Gems, you need erase only one.)</quote>.</p>

      <p>(<a idref="sect267">267</a>) Capitalized <quote>message</quote> in the second sentence of the second paragraph, since that is how retrievable items are supposed to be represented, and to be consistent with the first time the item is mentioned in this section. Added a period to the end of the illustration<ch.apos/>s caption.</p>
      <p>(<a idref="sect268">268</a>) Replaced <quote>wary</quote> with <quote>weary</quote>. We hardly think Lone Wolf would be wary among the King<ch.apos/>s soldiers.</p>

      <p>(<a idref="sect297">297</a>) Replaced all occurrences of <quote>your axe</quote> with <quote>your weapon</quote> because another weapon is available in <a idref="sect305">Section 305</a>.</p>
