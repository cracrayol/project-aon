<p>Sadly, <strong>Trevor Newton</strong>, illustrator of <cite>Voyage of the Moonstone</cite>, passed away in 2002 before Project Aon volunteers could contact him regarding his work for the <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> series. He illustrated a number of titles for younger readers. His wife has very kindly allowed us permission to use his work for <cite>Voyage of the Moonstone</cite> for Project Aon, stating <quote>I am sure Trevor would have been delighted to hear that Joe Dever<ch.apos/>s (and, incidentally, his own) work is being preserved.</quote></p>
