   <p><strong>Brian Williams</strong> was first noticed by Joe Dever for his work in <cite>White Dwarf</cite> magazine (circa issue 50) and the <cite>Real Life Gamebooks</cite> series by Jon Sutherland and Simon Farrell. Brian Williams was Joe<ch.apos/>s first choice of illustrators to replace Gary Chalk. Jon, being an old friend of Joe<ch.apos/>s, introduced the two. Brian was excited to work with Joe on the <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> series. He illustrated <cite>The Cauldron of Fear</cite> and almost every book about Magnamund since that time.</p>
   <p>When he learned that Joe Dever had started Project Aon, he readily and enthusiastically added his illustrations to the millennial gift.</p>
   <p>In October 2010, Brian Williams passed from this world unexpectedly at his home.</p>
