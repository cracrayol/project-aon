	You run through the darkening jungle forest and do Š	not stop until you are sure that your pursuers have Š	abandoned the chase. After a brief rest you press on Š	through the dense moss-covered trees, relying solely Š	upon your tracking skills to keep you moving in a Š	southerly direction. At last you emerge from the Š	jungle and rejoin the trail shortly after dawn the Š	following day. In the distance you see a bridge Š	across a steep-banked river. A glance at your map Š	tells you that this is a tributary of the River Ito, Š	and you decide to stop here to rest for an hour Š	before continuing your hard trek to Caeno on foot.

	Unless you possess the discipline of Grand Š	Huntmastery, you must now eat a Meal or lose 3 Š	ENDURANCE points.
