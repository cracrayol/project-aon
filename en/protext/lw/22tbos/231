	You push yourself away from the parapet and roll Š	across the deck in a desperate attempt to avoid being Š	crushed beneath the falling section of mast. Your Š	swift reactions save your life, for the shattered Š	timber slams through the prow decking where moments Š	before you had lain curled up in a ball. However, you Š	do not move quickly enough to avoid being stuck on Š	the legs by the mass of trailing ropes and debris Š	that falls in the wake of the broken masthead: lose 2 Š	ENDURANCE points.
