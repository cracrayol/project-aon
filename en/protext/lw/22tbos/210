	You force open the door to one of the houses and lead ä	the crewmen inside, but sadly your attempt at evasion ä	is short-lived. One of the owners of a neighbouring ä	house informs the city guard officer of where you are ä	hiding and within minutes his men have forced their ä	way in and overpowered you and your companions:	lose ä	2 ENDURANCE points.

	You are dragged into the courtyard and guarded at ä	spear-point until two horse-drawn wagons arrive to ä	take you away to the city gaol. As you are herded ä	aboard these foul-smelling carriages, your weapons, ä	Kai Weapon, and backpack items are confiscated and ä	dumped into a wooden crate beside the driver's seat. ä	(On your ÈAction ChartÈ mark each of these items with ä	an asterisk [*] to indicate that they are no longer ä	in your possession, but do not erase them at this ä	time. Any Special Items you possess are allowed to ä	remain with you.)
	
	At the officer's command the wagons move off at a ä	speedy pace. After a few bruising minutes your wagon ä	emerges from the gloomy streets and ascends a smooth ä	ramp which passes through the daunting gate of Ghol-ä	Tabras gaol. Above this gate flutters a flag which ä	depicts a black serpent entwined around the blade of ä	a silver scimitar. It is the personal emblem of ä	Sesketera, the ruler of this city, a man not known ä	for his kindness nor his mercy.
