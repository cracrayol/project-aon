	You ride the trail for more than an hour before you Š	come to a shallow ford across a fast-flowing stream. Š	After resting here to let your horse drink his fill, Š	you press on and enter a region of jungle highlands. Š	Night draws in and you halt to make camp among a Š	cluster of wind-worn boulders, close to the trail. Š	The area is carpetted with thick grasses that make Š	ideal fodder for your horse. After making sure that Š	his reins are securely fixed to a rock, you settle Š	yourself down to rest.
