	At length you arrive at the Lourdanian Consulate Š	where a guard at the gate allows you both to enter Š	and wait in its cool, tree-shaded courtyard. A few Š	minutes later you are met by the consul's assistant, Š	a rotund little official called Cheary. He is shocked Š	to hear of the pirate attack, and he urges Gregor to Š	accompany him inside the consulate to make a full Š	written report. He says that it could take several Š	hours, possibly even a day or two, and so you decide Š	that now is a good time to say farewell to your Š	companion. Before you go, Gregor offers you his Š	heartfelt thanks for all you have done for him, and Š	he hopes that one day soon your paths will cross Š	again.
	
	"If you should ever visit Pforodon," he says, "stop Š	by the Singing Lamb Tavern on Spike Street. If I'm Š	not there, the landlord will know where you can find Š	me."
	
	You wish Gregor a safe journey home, then you leave Š	the consulate and make your way back along the main Š	street to the harbour. The heat and dust of the Š	afternoon are making you thirsty and so you stop to Š	drink from a freshwater fountain set into the wall of Š	a crumbling old temple. The hustle and noise of the Š	street crowd is becoming oppressive and you yearn to Š	find somewhere quiet where you can rest before you Š	return to the ship. Looking around, you notice two Š	places which promise some respite. The first is a Š	public park which stands upon a cliff that looms Š	above the city to the east of the harbour wall. The Š	second is a narrow deserted alley that wends its way Š	into the city's Old Quarter.
