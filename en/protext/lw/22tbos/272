	Melchar leads you back through the streets of Caeno ä	to ÈThe Song of the Silver StarÈ tavern, and the young ä	journeyman laughs with sheer relief at having escaped ä	from Wrok's henchmen when finally you enter the ä	sanctuary of its crowded taproom. The innkeeper asks ä	Melchar if his happy mood is due to a win at the ä	derby. He says that, thanks to your advice, he did ä	not bet and therefore he did not lose. He also adds ä	the real reason why he is feeling elated, and the ä	innkeeper frowns.
	
	"Wrok's not a man to cross," he warns, "he's ruthless ä	when it comes to getting even. I think you two had ä	better stay in the attic tonight. Wrok's sure to send ä	his lackeys out a-huntin' for you."

	You heed the innkeeper's warning and spend the night ä	hidden in his attic room. Before dawn breaks you slip ä	out of the tavern by a back door and say farewell to ä	Melchar in the street outside. 

	"Captain Leonghi's ship is moored down at the docks," ä	he says. "It's called ÈEmbassageÈ. I wish you a swift ä	and safe journey to Nhang, Grand Master. I'll always ä	remember our little adventure at the Caeno Derby and ä	I hope we'll meet again one day when you return to ä	Sommerlund."
