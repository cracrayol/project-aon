	As the man's head dips under the water for the last Š	time, you dive into the muddy river and swim across Š	its surging current. Guided by your sixth sense, you Š	locate his body and then pull him to the surface. You Š	fight to maintain your grip as the powerful current Š	sweeps you downstream, and you are propelled along Š	for more than a mile before it finally deposits you Š	on the opposite bank. As you drag the man from the Š	water, you notice a group of huts in the distance. Š	You are about to haul the unconscious man over your Š	shoulder and set off towards them, when suddenly you Š	detect that he has no pulse. Using your Magnakai Š	discipline of Curing you are able to restart his Š	heart and empty the water from his lungs, yet you are Š	unable to restore him to full consciousness. The Š	sudden sound of voices makes you look towards the Š	huts where you see a group of natives pointing Š	excitedly in your direction. They are all wearing Š	jerkins and loincloths made from animal hide, Š	clothing that is identical to that worn by the man Š	you have saved from the river. You call to them and Š	wave your arms to attract their attention and they Š	quickly respond. You are expecting them to be be Š	pleased that you have saved one of their kinfolk, but Š	as they come closer you are shocked by their Š	unexpected response.
