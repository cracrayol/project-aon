	The villagers fire their bows and every arrow strikes ä	the dragon, yet none of them penetrate the creature's ä	scaly hide. You utter the words of the Brotherhood ä	spell - ÈLightning HandÈ - and direct your bolt of ä	energy at the creature's belly as it soars directly ä	overhead. It hits the creature and makes its shudder, ä	but it does not deflect it from its chosen course.
	 ä	The dragon circles the village once more and then ä	hovers above the burnt-out remains of the central ä	hut. You observe the creature and your Kai sixth ä	sense tells you that it has not come here bent on ä	destruction. It is seeking something in the charred ä	ruins.
