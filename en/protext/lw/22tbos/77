	Clutching at your wound, you hurry out of the park ä	and descend the steep path which leads down to the ä	harbour below. When you are sure that you have not ä	been followed, you pause to use your Magnakai skills ä	to heal your injury and check any poison that may ä	have tainted the blade of the cursed dagger. Dusk is ä	approaching by the time you reach ÈThe AzanÈ, and when ä	you go aboard you discover that the cargo has been ä	fully loaded. 
	
	Captain Jenkshi is pleased with his crew and feels ä	they deserve some reward for all their hard work. ä	Half of his men would like to spend the night ashore ä	at the Three Capstans Inn, one of their favourite ä	taverns. The tavernkeeper delivered some fresh food ä	to the ship during the afternoon, and he promised a ä	free flagon of ale to any crew member who paid him a ä	visit this evening. The Captain gives his permission, ä	but on one condition - all those who wish to go ä	ashore this evening must be back on board before dawn ä	breaks tomorrow.

	"We sail on the dawn tide," he bellows, "so don't ä	expect to find us still here if y'roll up late."

	If you decide to stay aboard with the Captain and the ä	remaining crew members, turn to  ‚288‚
