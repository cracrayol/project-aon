	The remaining looters flee from Tzai's warehouse, Š	pausing only to pick up and carry with them the Š	bodies of their confederates who fell to your deadly Š	blows. You help Tzai and his brother to secure the Š	warehouse doors by barracading them with crates and Š	barrels. Once this has been achieved, the three of Š	you return to the house to check that Tuvei and the Š	children are safe. 
	
	Soon the militia gain control of the main square and Š	the mob disperse. Chinn thanks you for saving his Š	life, and he apologises for the way he has behaved Š	since your arrival. He tells you that Gemulkin is an Š	old friend of his and he offers to take you to see Š	him first thing in the morning.
