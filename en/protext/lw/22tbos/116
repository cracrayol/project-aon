	As soon as you walk into the busy market square you Š	are assailed from all sides by merchants eager to Š	sell their wares. All manner of goods are offered but Š	most are of little or no use to you. As you push your Š	way through the merchants, you notice a market stall Š	that sells healing concoctions. One of these is Š	Laumspur for which the vendor is asking 2 Nobels per Š	potion. (Each potion of Laumspur restores 4 ENDURANCE Š	points when consumed after combat.)
	

	If you wish to ask the vendor if he knows the Š	whereabouts of Lord Zinair, turn to  â238â

	If you choose to leave the stall and continue across Š	the square, turn to  â53â
