	The creature stalks its chosen target. Gemulkin frees ä	himself from the wheel, but before he can get away, ä	the beast is upon him like a hungry lion. It grabs ä	him by the throat and lifts him off the deck. You ä	race across the slippery decking and unsheathe your ä	Kai weapon to strike the creature in the side. ä	Callously the beast hurls Gemulkin into the sea and ä	then spins around to face you. Your first blow opens ä	a wound across its chest, making it shriek loudly. ä	But it recovers in an instant and it lashes out at ä	you to connect with your shoulder. The force of the ä	blow knocks you sideways and sends you sliding across ä	the slick deck to fall headlong through an open cargo ä	hatch.
