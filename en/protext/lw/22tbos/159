	Your Kai senses reveal that this man is not trying to Š	help you at all. He is a charlatan, a sly and gifted Š	liar who is trying to lure you into a trap.

	Rather than follow him away from the quay, you tell Š	him that you have changed your mind and that you no Š	longer wish to find Captain Radyard. The man curses Š	you under his breath and then he hurries off into an Š	adjoining alleyway. You watch him disappear before Š	you walk across market square and enquire after Š	Radyard at the Masama Warehouse.
