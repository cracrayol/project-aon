	Using your Kai camouflage skills, you step away from ä	the door and press yourself into a shadowy recess in ä	the corridor wall. Then using your improved ä	discipline of Assimilance, you cause a noise to occur ä	at the far end of the corridor. The guards react ä	immediately; they grab their weapons and rush out of ä	the guardroom to investigate the strange rumbling ä	sound. As soon as they pass by, you slip inside the ä	room and retrieve your confiscated equipment (you may ä	now erase the asterisks from your ÈAction ChartÈ). 
	
	As you are sheathing your Kai weapon into your belt, ä	you hear the guards returning along the corridor. ä	Looking around you see that there is one other exit ä	from this room - a heavy oak door which is banded ä	with strips of black iron.
