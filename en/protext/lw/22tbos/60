	Your Kai sixth sense tells you that, despite his Š	threats, the bandit has no intention of chopping Š	through the rope which anchors the bridge. To do so Š	would lose him your horse, and horses are worth a Š	great many Nobels in this region of Shadaki. 

	However, you decide to play along with their game. Š	You raise your hands to give the impression that you Š	are surrendering, and when they order you to return Š	across the bridge, you pretend you do not understand. Š	The axeman shouts to his accomplice who is hidden in Š	the crevice. He tells him to stop pulling on the rope Š	and he dutifully obeys. As the bridge ceases to sway, Š	the axeman and one other walk across the bridge Š	towards you. They stop just beyond sword reach and Š	motion to you to lay down your weapons and equipment. Š	Slowly you lift the satchel off your shoulder. As the Š	strap clears your head, you grip it tightly and take Š	a swing at the axeman. The satchel catches him on the Š	jaw and the weight of the Moonstone knocks him Š	unconscious. His companion screams with anger and Š	lunges at you with his sword, but you swiftly Š	sidestep him and he loses his balance. With a fearful Š	cry on his lips he falls over the side of the bridge Š	and tumbles to his doom.

	Quickly you remount your horse and coax him across to Š	the far side. Angry voices echo from the gorge behind Š	you as you spur him to the gallop and escape along Š	the jungle trail beyond the bridge.
