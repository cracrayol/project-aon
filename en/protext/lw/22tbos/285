	You are within a dozen yards of a wall of jungle Š	trees when suddenly the ground gives way beneath your Š	feet and you fall headlong into a deep pit. Š	Fortunately, the base of this pit trap does not Š	contain sharpened stakes or any other such deadly Š	contrivances, yet you do sustain several cuts and Š	bruises when you land heavily upon its rocky base: Š	lose 3 ENDURANCE points.
