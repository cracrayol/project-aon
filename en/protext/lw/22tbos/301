	Quickly you unsheathe your Kai weapon and hurl it at Š	the sniper. It spins through the air and thuds into Š	his chest, sending him tumbling backwards from his Š	perch to land heavily upon the exposed roots of the Š	tree. You hurry to his body and retrieve your weapon. Š	To your disappointment, however, you discover that Š	his blowpipe and horn are now useless, both of them Š	having been smashed by his fall.
	
	Quickly you hide his body in the undergrowth and then Š	you move deeper into the jungle, guided and drawn by Š	the strange incessant noise.
