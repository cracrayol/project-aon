	The ferryman becomes impatient when you arrive at the ä	gate and are unable to pay the fare. After some ä	arguing he finally agrees to accept one backpack item ä	in lieu of cash. Delete from your ÈAction ChartÈ one ä	Backpack item of your own choosing.

	You step onto the ferry and take a place at the bow ä	rail. As you wait for the vessel to cast off, you ä	look around at your fellow travellers and notice that ä	most are merchants with wagons and handcarts loaded ä	with goods destined for the markets of Tiklu. It is ä	short voyage of twenty miles across the strait. When ä	the ferry approaches the landing jetty, your fellow ä	passengers get ready to leave. As they disembark, one ä	merchant's small cart is overturned and his cargo is ä	spilled onto the shore. The other merchants push past ä	him, but you feel sorry for his plight and you help ä	to calm his carthorse and retrieve his goods. He is ä	very grateful for your assistance and he offers you a ä	ride to Tiklu aboard his cart which you willingly ä	accept.
