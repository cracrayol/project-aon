	You land on your back with a severe jolt that leaves Š	you gasping for breath: lose 3 ENDURANCE points.
	You have crashed down upon the floor of a cargo hold Š	that is stacked with bales of silk. Above, framed in Š	the open hatchway, you can see the creature getting Š	ready to leap. Quickly you roll away as it drops into Š	the hold, and your speedy action saves you from its Š	deadly talons as maniacally the creature slashes at Š	the floor where, only moments before, you were lying.

	Hissing like an angry snake, it leaps after you and Š	lashes out again. This time it rakes its talons along Š	the wooden wall of the hull, barely inches above your Š	head. The tips of these razor-sharp claws become Š	embedded deeply in the timbers and for a few moments Š	the creature is held fast.
	
	
	If you wish to attack the creature while its talons Š	are stuck firmly in the hull, turn to  â82â
	
	If you choose to use this opportunity to try to evade Š	the creature, turn to  â143â
