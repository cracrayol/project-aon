	You follow the shadowy alleyway until you arrive at a Š	small square which is flanked on all sides by dingy Š	hovels and derelict shops. Only one of these shops is Š	open for business. A sign nailed above its worm-eaten Š	door says: DULGH'S CURIOS
	
	A bell tinkles as you push open the creaking door and Š	a gust of stale, musty air makes you cough as you Š	step into the gloomy interior. Despite its decrepit Š	appearance, you quickly discover that this shop is Š	full of strange and fascinating artifacts. One in Š	particular catches your eye. It is a porcelain Š	figurine of a small child which has uncannily Š	lifelike eyes.

	"Ah, you're a Sommlending, and you're a connoisseur Š	too I see," says a reedy voice. From behind a stand Š	of rusty armour there suddenly appears a little old Š	man. He squints at you through his thick spectacles Š	and wrinkles his face into the semblance of a smile.

	"It is a genuine Nhang Doll, one of the original one Š	hundred that were made for Emperor Hyunstai. Very Š	rare indeed. I'm wont to sell but, well, times are Š	hard. It can be yours for a mere 10 Gold Crowns."

	If you are willing to buy this doll for 10 Gold Š	Crowns, turn to  â21â

	If you wish to buy the doll but would first like to Š	barter with the old man to see if he will lower his Š	price, turn to  â99â

	If you do not wish to purchase the doll, you can Š	leave the curio shop by turning to  â204â
