	From out of the dark clouds there descends a winged Š	horror that freezes the blood of all who gaze upon Š	it. Heavily muscled and sheathed in a glistening Š	green skin, this nightmarish creature lands upon the Š	main deck and glares at the terrified crewmen through Š	slitted eyes. Its wings shrink and melt into its Š	shoulders and from its fang-filled mouth there issues Š	a chilling hiss. In the next instant, it springs Š	among the stunned crew to wreak carnage with its Š	razor-tipped claws. In their terror, many men throw Š	themselves into the sea to avoid the beast's deadly Š	talons. Relentlessly it forges its way towards the Š	stern and climbs the steps to the rear deck where it Š	stares at Gemulkin hungrily. The Captain fumbles to Š	release himself from the wheel as the creature looms Š	closer. Clearly it intends to slay him and you know Š	you must act quickly if you are to save Gemulkin from Š	a terrible fate.
