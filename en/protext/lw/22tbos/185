	You summon a Mindblast and project it into the depths Š	of the cave. The creatures lurking there are Š	susceptible to your powerful psychic charge and it Š	makes them howl in pain and frustration. In a state Š	of blind panic, two wolf-like animals suddenly rush Š	past you to disappear into the rainswept jungle. Š	Confident that they will not return, you settle Š	yourself down upon a bed of soft mosses and drift off Š	to sleep.
