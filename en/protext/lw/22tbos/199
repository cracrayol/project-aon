	You dodge the bolt successfully and the old man emits Š	a cry of shocked surprise when he sees you unsheathe Š	your Kai weapon. He turns tail and runs towards the Š	village, shrieking hysterically.
		
	You hear him calling the men of the village to gather Š	their weapons. He denounces you, saying that you have Š	attacked him without provocation, and he orders that Š	his men put you swiftly to the sword. Quickly you Š	turn and run towards the ridge. You know that it Š	would be useless to attempt to reason with these Š	people and so you resolve to reach the trail	and make Š	a hasty escape.
