	Guided by your companions, you make your way through Š	the darkening streets of Ghol-Tabras and arrive at Š	the entrance to the Flying Fish Tavern. The inn is Š	filled with the captains and crews of many of the Š	vessels that are moored down in the harbour. They are Š	a raucous crowd, yet their noise quietens to barely a Š	whisper the moment you and your companions step Š	through the door.

	Slowly you approach the bar, trying your best to Š	ignore the dark mutterings that are passing among the Š	hard-faced sailors. The innkeeper glares at you. It Š	is as if he is daring you to ask him for service. You Š	swallow hard and ask if he knows of anyone who would Š	be interested in buying some copper.
	
	"Hey, listen up," he shouts to the others, "This Š	infidel wants to sell some copper!"

	The crowded inn erupts with laughter. Now grinning Š	innanely, the innkeeper fixes you with his piggy eyes Š	and asks: "An' just what is it you've got to sell Š	then, eh? Your father's old spit-pot maybe? Bah! Š	Begone y'scabs. We don't serve the likes o'you no Š	more. I'm the new owner of this fine establishment Š	and we don't want your kind here!" 


	If you wish to attempt to buy some ale in the hope Š	that it will appease this boarish innkeeper, turn 
	to  â108â

	If you decide that you are wasting precious time Š	here, you can leave the inn by turning to  â249â
