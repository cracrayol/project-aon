	You wipe your weapon on the scraggy bodies of the Š	slain Kholo and then you drag them out of the cave by Š	their tails. Your encounter with these wild animals Š	leaves you feeling anxious for your safety, and you Š	spend a restless night in the cave listening to the Š	rain and the sounds of the surrounding jungle.

	During your lonely vigil, unless you possess the Š	discipline of Grand Huntmastery you must eat a Meal Š	or lose 3 ENDURANCE points.
