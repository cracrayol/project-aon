	Using the Brotherhood spell - ÈMind CharmÈ - you ä	convince the sceptical officer that you really are ä	telling the truth. Fearing a diplomatic row with the ä	Dessian ambassador, he apologises repeatedly for your ä	arrest and he orders that your weapons be restored to ä	you at once. He then escorts you personally in a ä	horse-drawn carriage to Lord Zinair's residence - the ä	Dessian Consulate - in the city's north quarter. 

	As the toadying officer and his carriage departs, you ä	turn to face the entrance to the consulate building. ä	With mounting anticipation, you climb the front steps ä	and knock on its stout oak door.
