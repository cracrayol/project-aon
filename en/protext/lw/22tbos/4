	You fight your way to the surface of the churning sea ä	and gulp a lungful of air. All about you are flailing ä	lumps of debris, foaming bubbles, and treacherous ä	strands of rope and canvas that threaten to entangle ä	your limbs and drag you to your doom. Breathing hard, ä	you fill your lungs and feed oxygen to your blood ä	before diving deep below the flotsam of the dying ä	ship. You surface beyond the debris and swim for the ä	shore, now less than a mile distant. 
	
	The waves bring you ashore upon a rocky beach where ä	you crawl for shelter among boulders at the base of a ä	chalk cliff. From here you see the wreck of the ä	ÈVargasÈ come drifting towards the shoreline to be ä	smashed to pieces on the rocks. Gangs of men are ä	pacing the beach, salvaging cargo and slaying any ä	crewman who is washed ashore alive. They are ä	wreckers, and your Kai senses tell you that they are ä	led by an evil magician who possesses great power. ä	You can feel the aura of his presence nearby, high ä	upon the cliffs, and you know that he has been ä	responsible for the wicked destruction of the ÈVargasÈ ä	and its crew.

	Using your Kai camouflage skills to keep yourself ä	hidden from the wreckers, you hurry away along the ä	rocky coast. During your escape, unless you possess ä	the discipline of Grand Huntmastery, you must eat a ä	Meal or lose 3 ENDURANCE points.
