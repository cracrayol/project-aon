	You wake with the rising sun and check your equipment Š	before leaving the timberyard to walk along the Š	waterfront to the neighbouring ferry station. You can Š	see the ferry approaching across the strait. It is Š	loaded with carts and horses and more than a hundred Š	people. A queue has formed at the station gate where Š	a ferryman is waiting to collect the crossing fare. A Š	board slung around his chest informs you that the Š	price of the crossing is 2 Nobels.


	If you can afford the price of the crossing, turn 
	to  â188â

	If you do not have 2 Nobels, turn to  â287â
