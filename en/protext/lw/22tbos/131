	You whisper the words of the Brotherhood spell -ä	ÈLightning HandÈ - and wait for the familiar tingle of ä	power to occur in your arm before you leap up and ä	point at the creature in the doorway. There is a ä	flash of bluish light, then a bolt of energy arcs ä	from your finger to hit the beast in the neck. The ä	impact of your magical missile slams the creature ä	against the wall of the hold, but it does not ä	incapacitate it. Before it can fully recover, you ä	unsheathe your Kai weapon and rush forward to strike ä	the first blow.
