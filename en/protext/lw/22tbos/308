	Night has fallen since you were first imprisoned in ä	the hut and you are able to use the cover of darkness ä	to avoid being seen. You are anxious to escape from ä	this place but you are not prepared to leave without ä	first retrieving the Moonstone, your weapons, and ä	your confiscated equipment. 
	
	You allow your Kai sixth sense to guide you to where ä	your Kai weapon is being stored. It is a large wooden ä	shack at the centre of the settlement, and it is ä	occupied by the village elders. Soon the news of your ä	disappearance prompts the leader to order a search. ä	You stay hidden until the shack is empty and the ä	coast is clear, and then you enter it by means of an ä	open window. Inside you discover all of your ä	confiscated equipment, as well as several other items ä	which could prove useful during your quest:

	   Bow                   Bottle of Rice Wine
	   6 Arrows              Soap
	   Spear                 Short Sword
	   Rope                  Lantern
	   Fish Hooks (3)        Crystal Prism (ÈSpecial ItemÈ)
	
	Having restored your equipment, you leave the shack ä	and make your way into the jungle. Your Kai skills ä	enable you to avoid the villagers and make a swift ä	escape westwards into the hills.
