	You pat your belt pouch to make the coins inside Š	jingle, and then you tell the innkeeper that you want Š	to buy your companions a drink.
	
	"What's wrong wiv' you?  Ya hard o'hearin'? I said Š	get out and I meant get out!" And with these harsh Š	words the innkeeper flashes a glance at a group of 
	mean-faced men who are standing along the counter. Š	They put down their ales and then move slowly towards Š	you, their hands hovering menacingly around the hilts Š	of their swords and daggers. For a few anxious Š	moments it looks as if a fight is about to break out, Š	but than a gruff voice arises from the corner of the Š	taproom and the men halt in their tracks.

	"Hold y'horses," says the commanding voice, "Let me Š	speak with the Northlander."

	You peer across the smoky room and see that the voice Š	belongs to a stout, bearded man who is sitting alone Š	in an alcove. He beckons you to join him, but when Š	you approach his table in the company of the Suhnese Š	crewmen he suddenly snaps at you: "I said I wanted to Š	speak to you, not these raggin' crows. If you want to Š	do business with me, they'll have to wait for you in Š	the street outside."


	If you decide to agree to his terms, turn to  â164â

	If you refuse to part company with the Suhnese, turn Š	to  â121â
