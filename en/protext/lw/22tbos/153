	The celebrations go on throughout the night, but you Š	are able to find a quiet place to sleep for a few Š	hours before dawn breaks over this happy city. When Š	you tell the people that you must leave and continue Š	your journey south, they are saddened by the news. Š	They want you to stay as their new chieftain, but you Š	persuade them that they must choose a new leader from Š	among their own tribe. Before you leave they provide Š	you with a mule and some food (enough for up to 3 Š	Meals). 
	
	By mule you expect the overland journey from Kitaezi Š	to Caeno to take no more than three days. It is a Š	rough, potholed trail and yet your mule never once Š	misses his footing or causes you to fall. During the Š	afternoon of the second day you enter the foothills Š	of the Hulhuk Mountains and see a plume of black Š	smoke rising into the sky. It comes from behind a Š	treeless ridge, less than half a mile from the trail.
	The sound of anguished voices can be heard on the Š	wind and these cries prompt you to leave the trail Š	and investigate. As you crest the ridge you see a Š	small native village. Several of the huts are on fire Š	and its people are trying desperately to save their Š	livestock and quell the raging flames.
