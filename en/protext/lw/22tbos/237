	When you decline his offer of food, the bald man ä	shrieks with rage and begins to curse you in a ä	language that you do not recognise. Even so, the mere ä	sound of his vile curses is enough to send a shiver ä	of dread coursing down your spine, like a trickle of ä	icy cold water. He denounces you to the others as an ä	agent of the City Council sent to spy on their ä	meeting, and he orders them to attack and slay you. ä	The men react slowly to his frantic commands. It is ä	as if they are struggling to awaken from a deep ä	sleep. You have no wish to fight these men and so you ä	turn and run towards the park entrance to escape from ä	them. As you reach the open gate, you glance over ä	your shoulder to see that the bald man is preparing ä	to hurl a dagger at your back.
