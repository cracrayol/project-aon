	  IMPROVED GRAND MASTER DISCIPLINES - KAI GRAND MASTER SUPERIOR

	
	‚Animal Mastery‚
	Kai Grand Master Superiors who possess this discipline ä	are able to deter predatory animals in the wild by ä	exuding a scent which is repellent to them. In order ä	for this improved discipline to work effectively, a ä	Grand Master Superior must be aware of the species of ä	predatory animal he/she wishes to deter. The scent can ä	only be detected by the targetted animal.
	
	‚Assimilance‚
	Kai Grand Master Superiors who possess this skill are ä	able to create a noise and project it up to 50 feet ä	away from their location. The noise is akin to the ä	rumbling sound of thunder and it can be used to ä	distract or divert an enemy's attention. This improved ä	discipline requires a degree of preparation and ä	therefore it cannot be used during combat. 
	
	‚Astrology‚
	Kai Grand Master Superiors who possess this discipline ä	are skilled in the use of all mechanical devices ä	designed to measure and/or observe the cosmology of ä	Magnamund. Such devices include sextants, astrolabes, ä	and orreries.

	‚Herbmastery‚
	Kai Grand Master Superiors who have this discipline ä	are able to purify water thereby making contaminated ä	or briny water suitable for consumption. Roughly two ä	pints of water per day can be purified using this ä	skill alone. This daily total steadily increases as a ä	Grand Master advances in rank.                                            

	‚Elementalism‚
	Kai Grand Master Superiors who possess this skill are ä	able to condense pure water out of the surrounding ä	air. This water can be made to fall as a fine spray or ä	as a sudden deluge. It can also be made to fill any ä	suitable container or receptacle. Using this skill, ä	Grand Master Superiors can create the equivalent of ä	one large bucketful of fresh water.

	‚Bardsmanship‚
	Kai Grand Master Superiors who possess this discipline ä	are able to utilize their musical skills to pacify
	an excited or hostile animal.
