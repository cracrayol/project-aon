	You raise your Kai weapon and launch a swipe at the Š	creature's neck. With stunning speed, the beast grabs Š	your forearm with its free claw and stops you landing Š	your blow. Its talons bite into your flesh and its Š	crushing strength makes it hard for you to keep hold Š	of your weapon: lose 3 ENDURANCE points.	

	The deck lurches as the ship is hit by a wave and the Š	sudden movement throws the creature off-balance. As Š	its grip slackens momentarilly, you are able to twist Š	yourself free from its claws and escape into an Š	adjacent cargo hold.
