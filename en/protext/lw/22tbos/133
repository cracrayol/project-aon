	You try to dive out of the path of the speeding dart Š	but your reactions are too slow to avoid it hitting Š	you in the arm. Quickly you pluck it from your flesh Š	and inspect its tip for poison. Your stomach churns Š	when you see that it is smeared with a noisome black Š	fluid. Then a sudden wave of nausea washes over you, Š	confirming your worst fears.


	If you possess the Grand Master discipline of Š	Deliverance, turn to  â46â

	If you do not, turn to  â236â
