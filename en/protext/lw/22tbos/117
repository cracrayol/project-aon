	You dismount from your mule and hurry into the Š	village. The fiercest fire is raging through the roof Š	of the largest hut which dominates the centre of the Š	settlement, and it is here that you use your Kai Š	skill to best effect. You suppress the flames, Š	shrinking them and containing them so that the Š	villagers are able to approach with buckets of water Š	and put out the blaze. 

	When all of the smaller fires in the surrounding huts Š	have also been extinguished, the elder of the village Š	thanks you for your timely help. He tells you that Š	the fire was started deliberately by a dragon that Š	dwells in the Hulhuk Mountains. 
	
	"It is the bane of our humble village," he says, Š	shaking his head sadly. "We fear that it will return Š	this night to finish us." Seeing the Kai weapon Š	sheathed at your side, the elder looks at you with Š	hope in his eyes. He begs you to stay here tonight Š	and help rid the village of its bane.
