	The avenue twists like a snake through a maze of old Š	houses and boarded-up shops until it finishes Š	abruptly at a dead end. You search for a way through Š	to the harbour that is nearby, but there are none to Š	be found.

	Suddenly you hear the sound of the city watch getting Š	closer, and you suddenly realise that all you can do Š	now is fight or surrender to them.


	If you wish to fight the city watch, turn to  â148â

	If you choose to surrender to them, turn to  â345â
