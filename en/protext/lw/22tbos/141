	Your advanced healing skills tell you that the owner ä	of the shop is a very sick man. You sense that his ä	illness is caused by his constant exposure to the ä	vapours from dyes and potions that he keeps in stock. ä	You offer to help cure him of his ailment and at ä	first he is sceptical. In the past he has wasted ä	hundreds of Nobels on physicians and their quack ä	remedies and all to no avail. It is not until you ä	offer to treat him without charge that he has a ä	sudden change of heart.
	
	You place one hand on his chest and the other on his ä	forehead. Then you concentrate on projecting you ä	healing power into his body, and you sense that ä	toxins in his blood are beginning to disappear. ä	Gradually his damaged internal organs rejuvenate and ä	his skin takes on a healthy glow.

	Astonished and delighted by the miraculous recovery ä	you have brought about, the shopkeeper takes from ä	around his neck a valuable emerald medallion and he ä	insists that you accept it as a token of his thanks.

	If you wish to accept this Emerald Medallion, record ä	it on your ÈAction ChartÈ as a Special item which you ä	keep in your pocket.
