	The shock of the unexpected blow knocks the air from Š	your lungs and somersaults you down into the water.
	You draw upon your Kai skills to numb your pain and Š	gather your senses, and as your vision clears you Š	discover that you are still in one piece. However, Š	the satchel containing the Moonstone is no longer Š	slung around your shoulder. The strap has broken and Š	you glimpse the bag sinking towards a coral reef, Š	five fathoms below. Suddenly you sense movement in Š	the water and you twist around. Speeding towards you Š	comes a marine monster; it is returning after having Š	rammed you in the back. It resembles a gigantic Š	crocodile, but one with a blunt-muzzled head and Š	scales of dull grey horn. As it closes for the kill Š	its great jaw swings open revealing a ghastly red maw Š	lined with dozens of dagger-like fangs. 	


	If you wish to try to reach the surface and fill your Š	empty lungs with fresh air, turn to  â166â

	If you decide to unsheathe your Kai Weapon and Š	prepare to defend yourself from this creature's Š	attack, turn to  â67â
