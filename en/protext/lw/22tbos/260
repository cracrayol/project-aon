	The monster writhes in its death throes, spreading ä	its blood like a huge crimson cloud through the warm ä	tropical sea. For a fleeting moment you surface to ä	take a breath, then you dive through the cloud of ä	blood and retrieve your lost satchel from the coral ä	reef. Having regained your precious charge, you stay ä	submerged and swim towards the shore.

	Aching and close to exhaustion, you crawl from the ä	sea and work your way slowly up the beach to the ä	cover of a fallen toa tree. Here you lie upon the wet ä	sand and look out at the two ships standing half a ä	mile off the coast. The longboat from the Sesketera ä	is circling the bloodstained water and its crew ä	appear to be searching for your remains.
