	You muster your psychic power and launch a Mindblast at ä	the officer. The man begins to shake. Then he drops his ä	pistol and clutches his head with both hands. His ä	sudden shriek of agony alarms the marines and, in the ä	confusion, you are able to take a deep breath and throw ä	yourself over the side.

	Your Magnakai discipline of Nexus soon frees you from ä	the cord that binds your wrists and you strike out for ä	the distant shore. Only once you have passed beyond the ä	shadow of Sesketera's flagship do you dare come up for ä	air. As you break the surface, you notice that the crew ä	of ÈThe TriasusÈ are scouring the sea, straining ä	themselves to catch a glimpse of where you are. A ä	marine on the prow deck spots you and, to your ä	surprise, Sesketera's crew begin to laugh and jeer.

	You are trying to fathom the reason for their ä	laughter when suddenly you are struck in the back by ä	a heavy, powerful blow.

	Pick a number from the ÈRandom Number TableÈ. If the ä	number you have chosen is odd (ie. 1,3,5,7,9) reduce ä	your ENDURANCE score by 3. If the number you have ä	chosen is even (ie. 0,2,4,6,8) reduce your ENDURANCE ä	score by 5.
