	The moment you strike the killing blow, the ä	creature's body transforms into a hissing mass of ä	fiery green sparks. Rapidly these sparks dissolve ä	leaving no trace, except for a lingering odour of ä	decay. Your Kai senses ä	detect that the creature was a magical creation, an ä	evil summonation sent here to find the Moonstone. 
	
	As you retrieve your Kai weapon, you ponder who could ä	be responsible for the creature's creation and ä	presence here. Then suddenly your thoughts are forced ä	to turn to more immediate matters. The hull of the ä	ÈVargasÈ is starting to crack under the relentless ä	pounding of the waves. The hold is rapidly filling ä	with water and you must act swiftly to escape from ä	here before it becomes your watery tomb.
