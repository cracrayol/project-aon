	You halt and very slowly lift your hands away from ä	your sides to demonstrate to the Eldenorans that you ä	are not reaching for a weapon. Then you focus on the ä	Eldenoran Captain and launch a sharp pulse of psychic ä	Kai energy at his head. He gasps, and then he lets ä	the crewman fall to the taproom floor as the power of ä	your psychic probe burns through his mind like a red-ä	hot dagger.
	
	Fearing that their Captain is having some kind of ä	fit, the drunken Eldenorans begin to panic. Some ä	throw their ale into his face to revive him, while ä	others struggle to lift his heavy body onto a ä	cluttered table. When one man slices open the ä	Captain's close-fitting leather jerkin with his ä	dagger, so as to help him breathe, another thinks ä	that he is attacking his master. He punches him ä	unconscious and suddenly a fist-fight erupts. During ä	the commotion, you indicate to the Suhnese that now ä	would be a good time to leave. Without a word they ä	rise from their tables and move towards the door, ä	pausing only to pick up their injured comrade as they ä	make a hasty exit from the tavern. Once outside, the ä	Suhnese can afford to laugh at the incredible ä	stupidity of the Eldenorans. It is hollow laughter, ä	but at least it helps them to relieve the frustration ä	of having to return early to ÈThe AzanÈ.
