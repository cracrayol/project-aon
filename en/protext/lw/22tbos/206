	You make a quick search of the dead henchmen and ä	discover the following items:

	Swords (3)
	Daggers (3)
	Nobels (8)

	Melchar helps you to hide their bodies before you ä	leave the tack room. Outside, you discover that the ä	race has ended and that the favourite ÈForlu-zhanÈ came ä	in last. The crowds are bitterly disappointed with ä	the result, but Wrok the Bookmaker is beaming with ä	joy for he and his conspirators have made a fortune ä	by sabotaging the favourite guanza. He begins to ä	wonder why his henchmen have not returned, and when ä	he looks to the tack room door, he catches sight of ä	you and Melchar leaving. Frantically he signals to ä	his conspirators to stop you getting away. You see ä	them closing in and you grab Melchar by the arm for ä	fear of losing him among the crowds that are heading ä	for the exit gates.
