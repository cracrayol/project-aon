	As you tumble over the side of the boat, and the tip ä	of the officer's half-pike misses you by inches. Upon ä	hitting the water you sink like a stone, but your ä	Magnakai discipline of Nexus soon frees you from the ä	cord that binds your wrists and you are able to ä	strike out for the distant shore. Only once you have ä	passed beyond the shadow of Sesketera's flagship do ä	you dare come up for air. As you break the surface, ä	you notice that the crew of ÈThe TriasusÈ are scouring ä	the sea, straining themselves to catch a glimpse of ä	where you are. A marine on the prow deck spots you ä	and, to your surprise, Sesketera's crew begin to ä	laugh and jeer.

	You are trying to fathom the reason for their ä	laughter when suddenly you are struck in the back by ä	a heavy, powerful blow.

	Pick a number from the ÈRandom Number TableÈ. If the ä	number you have chosen is odd (ie. 1,3,5,7,9) reduce ä	your ENDURANCE score by 3. If the number you have ä	chosen is even (ie. 0,2,4,6,8) reduce your ENDURANCE ä	score by 5.
