	Swiftly you leap over the bodies of the slain	gaolers ä	and rush into the guardroom to retrieve your ä	confiscated equipment (you may now erase the ä	asterisks from your ÈAction ChartÈ). 
	
	As you are sheathing your Kai weapon into your belt, ä	you hear the sound of footsteps descending a flight ä	of stone steps at the far end of the corridor. More ä	gaolers are approaching; they have been drawn to ä	investigate by the dying cries of their brother ä	guards.
	
	Desperately you scan the walls of the guardroom for ä	some means of escape and suddenly you see that there ä	is one other exit from this room - a heavy oak door ä	which is banded with strips of black iron.
