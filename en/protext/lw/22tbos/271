	You take the glass and sip the cherry-coloured ä	liqueur. It has a delicious flavour and you commend ä	the guildsman for his good taste. The man is greatly ä	flattered, so much so that he offers you a bottle of ä	this fine Scava liqueur. (If you wish to accept his ä	offer, record this Bottle of Scava on your ÈAction ä	ChartÈ as a backpack item)

	You then bid the guildsman good evening and promise ä	that you will return tomorrow morning to conclude ä	your business. On leaving the hall you rejoin the ä	Suhnese and hurry with them through the flagstoned ä	streets of the city, retracing your route back to the ä	harbour in the hope of reaching ÈThe AzanÈ before night ä	closes in completely. You are within a few hundred ä	yards of the harbour entrance when suddenly a patrol ä	of the city watch come marching around a corner with ä	their spears couched on their chainmailed shoulders. ä	Their officer commands you all to halt and demands ä	that you raise your hands above your heads.

	If you decide to make a dash for the harbour, turn
