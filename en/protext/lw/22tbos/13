	You are awoken during the night by the sound of ä	squeaking. You prise open your eyes and, using your ä	infra-vision, you see a pair of rats are busily ä	gnawing at your backpack. You lash out with your fist ä	and they run squealing for the safety of the ä	darkness.

	Any food (Meals) that you have in your backpack has ä	been spoiled by the rats (erase all Meals from your ä	ÈAction ChartÈ).

	After this disturbance, you find it difficult to ä	return to sleep. Erase 1 ENDURANCE point due to a ä	broken night's rest.
