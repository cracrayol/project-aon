	You follow the man as he requests, but when his path Š	begins to veer away from the quayside you start to Š	feel a little uneasy. You suspect that he is either Š	lost, drunk, or not quite the helpful old beggar he Š	makes himself out to be.
	
	You ask where he is taking you and he says that he Š	knows a short-cut through the town. He leads you into Š	an alley and moments later your fears are confirmed Š	when you find yourself surrounded by six knife-Š	wielding thugs. Your weasel-faced guide disappears Š	into the shadows and the thugs fall upon you from all Š	sides.
