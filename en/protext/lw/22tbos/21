	Carefully the old man wraps the doll in a square of ä	linen while you count out 10 Gold Crowns from your ä	belt pouch. With trembling hands he takes the coins ä	and gives the package which you place into your ä	backpack.
	
	Record the Nhang Doll on your ÈAction ChartÈ as a ä	Special Item, and remember to erase 10 Gold Crowns ä	from your current total.
