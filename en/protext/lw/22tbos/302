	Using your Kai camouflage skills, you step away from ä	the door and press yourself into a shadowy recess in ä	the corridor wall. Then using your powers of Grand ä	Nexus, you cause a torch at the far end of the ä	corridor to topple out of its wall bracket. The ä	guards react immediately; they grab their weapons and ä	rush out of the guardroom to investigate the noise.
	As soon as they pass by, you slip inside the room and ä	retrieve your confiscated equipment (you may now ä	erase the asterisks from your ÈAction ChartÈ). 
	
	As you are sheathing your Kai weapon into your belt, ä	you hear the guards come walking back along the ä	corridor. Looking around you see that there is one ä	other exit from this room - a heavy oak door which is ä	banded with strips of black iron.
