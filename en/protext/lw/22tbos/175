	You leave your cell and make your way silently along Š	towards the guardroom. You are determined to retrieve Š	your Kai weapon and equipment, but you are also aware Š	that you must avoid alerting the guards if you are to Š	preserve your hopes of escaping from this gaol alive.

	Peering around the door to the guardroom you discover Š	that it is occupied by three gaolers. They are Š	playing cards, and they are using the crate which Š	contains your equipment as a makeshift table. In Š	order to get at your equipment you must first lure Š	the gaolers out of the room.
