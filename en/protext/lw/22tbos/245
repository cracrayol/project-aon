	Sesketera rushes at you and launches a whirlwind Š	flurry of thrusts and sweeps that force you away from Š	Oriah's body. You unsheathe your Kai weapon and the Š	clang of striking metal echoes throughout the hall as Š	you parry his relentless rain of blows. Suddenly the Š	sharp report of your colliding weapons is answered by Š	the dull ringing of a bell in a distant part of the Š	citadel. It is an alarm bell, and it is announcing Š	your escape from the dungeons of the gaol.
