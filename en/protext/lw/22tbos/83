	The man curses you quietly under his breath and then Š	he melts away into the taproom crowd. You leave the Š	tavern and approach the Masama Warehouse.	On entering Š	this vast building you discover that it is filled Š	with huget quantities of raw and basic commodities Š	such as metals, grain, cloth, timber, and leather. As Š	you inspect these basic materials you come across Š	several crates of linen that are branded with a crown Š	and star, the mark of Siyen. Your Kai senses tell you Š	that it could be part of Radyard's cargo.
	
	The owner of the warehouse approaches and asks the Š	nature of your business. He has an oily smile that Š	you could find easy to dislike. You ask if he knows Š	Captain Radyard and his slippery smile turns into a Š	scowl:

	"I charge for information," he snaps. "Hand over 3 Š	Nobels or be on your way."


	If you wish to pay the man 3 Nobels (1 Nobel = 1 Gold Š	Crown), turn to  â315â

	If you refuse to pay him, turn to  â217â
