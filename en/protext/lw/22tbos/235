	Melchar excuses himself and then goes to another Š	table where he talks with a bearded man wearing a Š	three-cornered hat. When he returns he is smiling.
	
	"Old Captain Leonghi owes me a favour or two," he Š	says, cocking his thumb towards the man. "He can't Š	take you to Suhn but he'll take you as far as Nhang, Š	and he's agreed to free passage. It's a good offer. Š	You'd be mad to try to go south from here on foot - Š	the Koltains are full of bandits. You'd never make it Š	there alive, or at least not completely in one Š	piece."

	You thank Melchar for his help and accept the Š	Captain's offer. He tells you that Leonghi will sail Š	for Nhang in two days time. As you have a day free in Š	the city, Melchar invites you to go with him to the Š	Caeno Derby tomorrow. He won two tickets in a dice Š	game last night and he would be pleased to give one Š	of them to you. You accept and agree to meet him here Š	in the taproom for breakfast before leaving for the Š	race track.
