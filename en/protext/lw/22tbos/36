	You leave the tavern door and walk back along the ä	waterfront. Beyond the ferry station is a marine ä	timberyard and a chandler's warehouse. The smell of ä	freshly sawn timber reminds you of the Fryelund ä	forest which surrounds your Kai monastery.
	It is a memory that makes you feel a little homesick. 
	The timberyard is deserted and so you decide that you ä	will sleep this night among its fragrant stacks of ä	pine and mountain oak.  

	Pick a number from the ÈRandom Number TableÈ.


	If the number you have chosen is  ‚0‚ - ‚4‚, turn to  ‚211‚

	If it is  ‚5‚ - ‚9‚, turn to  ‚13‚
