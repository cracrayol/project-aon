	Calling upon your Grand Mastery skills, you focus Š	upon the section of stone door jamb into which the Š	drawbolt is secured, and you cause it to vibrate. It Š	is a slow and tiring process (lose 3 ENDURANCE Š	points) but eventually the stonework cracks under Š	this persistent pressure. When the strength of the Š	stone has been sufficiently undermined, you are then Š	able to wrench open the cell door.
