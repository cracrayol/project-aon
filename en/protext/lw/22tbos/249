	You resign yourself to the fact that you are unlikely ä	to find a buyer for copper in this unfriendly inn and ä	so you turn to leave. Seeing this, the drunken louts ä	in the taproom start to jeer at you and throw food ä	and ale at your companions. In the face of this ä	mindless abuse you lead them out of the tavern and ä	begin retracing your route back to the harbour in the ä	hope of reaching ÈThe AzanÈ before night closes in ä	completely. You are within a few hundred yards of the ä	harbour entrance when suddenly a patrol of the city ä	watch come marching around a corner with their spears ä	couched on their chainmailed shoulders. Their officer ä	commands you all to halt and demands that you raise ä	your hands above your heads.
	

	If you wish to do as the officer has ordered, turn to  ä	‚228‚
	
	If you decide to make a dash for the harbour, turn 
	to  ‚330‚
