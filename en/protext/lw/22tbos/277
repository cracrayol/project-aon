	Jenkshi tells you that it will take three days to ä	cross the Gulf of Tentarium to the Shadakine city of ä	Zharloum. There ÈThe AzanÈ will dock overnight and ä	collect its cargo of metal ingots, which are to be ä	traded when the ship reaches its home port of Suhn. 

	Your first day in the Gulf passes pleasantly, yet on ä	the second day the weather closes in and a squall ä	keeps you confined to your cabin for most of the ä	morning. By mid-afternoon the rain abates and you go ä	up on deck to take some exercise. You are looking out ä	across the ocean towards the east when suddenly you ä	notice something bobbing in the water. You magnify ä	your vision and see that it is a man clinging to a ä	piece of wreckage. Quickly you inform Captain ä	Jenkshi, yet, to your surprise, he is very reluctant ä	to change course in order to rescue this man. 


	If you wish to use your psychic Kai skills to ä	persuade Jenkshi to pick up this man, turn to  ‚84‚
		
	If you choose not to influence the Captain's decision ä	in this way, turn to  ‚184‚
