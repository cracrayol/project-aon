	Fearing that Hiojin will carry out his threat, in Š	desperation you make one last attempt to reason with Š	the man.
	
	"If I were an assassin, do you really think that I Š	would ask the City Guard for directions to my Š	victim's house ?"
	
	Hiojin frowns. He is beginning to have doubts about Š	his assumption that you are a hired killer. Rather Š	than admit that he could be wrong he begins to Š	bluster:
	
	"Er, I'll have to look into this further. In the Š	meantime you will be held here pending...er, further Š	investigations." 

	Hiojin quickly summons his men and has you taken away Š	and placed in a solitary cell.
