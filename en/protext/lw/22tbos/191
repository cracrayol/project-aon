	Using the Brotherhood spell - ÈSense EvilÈ - you are ä	able to detect that this is no ordinary storm - it is ä	the result of an evil elemental sorcery. You urge ä	Gemulkin to turn his ship about for the fury of this ä	unnatural storm is churning the sea, making it boil ä	and seethe. Fearing for the safety of his cargo and ä	crew the Captain readily agrees and he orders his ä	helmsman to bring the ship around. But as the ÈVargasÈ ä	returns towards Shuri Point, Gemulkin suddenly sees ä	something on the horizon that makes him change his ä	mind.
