	Instinct and years of Kai training make you throw Š	yourself to the ground. The blowpipe dart passes Š	within inches of your scalp and then embeds itself in Š	the stem of a broad-leafed plant. Black fluid oozes Š	from the puncture hole made by its tip and you watch Š	aghast as the plant rapidly shrivels and dies.
