	You rejoin your companions and hurry with them ä	through the flagstoned streets, retracing your route ä	back to the harbour in the hope of reaching ÈThe AzanÈ ä	before the night closes in completely. You are within ä	a few hundred yards of the harbour entrance when ä	suddenly a patrol of the city watch come marching ä	around a corner with their spears couched on their ä	chainmailed shoulders. Their officer commands you all ä	to halt and demands that you raise your hands above ä	your heads.
	

	If you wish to do as the officer has ordered, turn to  ä	‚228‚
	
	If you decide to make a dash for the harbour, turn 
	to  ‚330‚
