	You insert the key in the door and twist it. To your Š	relief, you hear and feel the lock disengage and then Š	the door creaks open to reveal a flight of spiral Š	stairs which ascend into darkness above. 
	
	Hurriedly you climb these stone steps and come to a Š	landing where several corridors converge. Some are Š	occupied by gaolers and other officials of Š	Sesketera's citadel who are going about their duties. Š	Then you hear the sound of footsteps ascending the Š	stairs behind you, and it reminds you of the pressing Š	need to keep moving. You draw upon your Magnakai Š	disciplines of Huntmastery and Pathsmanship to help Š	in choosing the best route and, to your surprise, in Š	so doing you discover a secret panel in the wall at Š	the head of the staircase. You reach out and press a Š	raised stud and the concealed panel slides open to Š	reveal a narrow passageway beyond. Quickly you enter Š	this passage and the panel automatically clicks shut Š	behind you.
