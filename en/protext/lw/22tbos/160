	As you stagger to your feet from beneath the tangle ä	of debris, you look along the main deck and see that ä	brave Captain Jenkshi has taken over the helm. With ä	grim determination he steers his battered ship ä	relentlessly towards the channel. You see him cursing ä	the enemy captain and shaking his fist defiantly at ä	the villainous Shadakine gunners as their cannonballs ä	whistle across the decks of ÈThe AzanÈ, then a gust of ä	wind fills the torn mainsail and the ship begins to ä	pull away from the lumbering man o'war. A second ä	broadside falls wide of its mark, and Jenkshi's bold ä	plan finally pays off when the enemy ship is forced ä	to veer away for fear beaching her hull in the ä	shallows. The crew cheer loudly when they see her red ä	sails falling away to the stern and ÈThe AzanÈ is left ä	alone to make a swift passage through the islet ä	channel. You make your way along the debris-strewn ä	deck to congratulate Jenkshi on his masterful display ä	of seamanship. He accepts your praise and the cheers ä	of his crew with a rueful smile, even though his ä	skill and his coolness under enemy fire have ä	undoubtedly saved the ship and the lives of all ä	aboard. However, as the ship emerges on the far side ä	of the islets, you soon discover that more than just ä	Jenkshi's bravery will be needed if everyone aboard ä	ÈThe AzanÈ is to live to tell the tale of their deadly ä	encounter with the buccaneers of Shadaki.
