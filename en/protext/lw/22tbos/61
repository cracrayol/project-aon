	You enter this imposing herballist's shop and stare ä	in awe at the thousands of stoppered jars that line ä	its wooden shelves and counters. They contain all ä	manner of rare liquids, powders, roots and tinctures, ä	most with foreign names that are unfamiliar. You ä	scour the jars and find only two which contain herbs ä	from Sommerlund with which you are very familiar.

	POTION OF LAUMSPUR: restores 4 ENDURANCE points when 
	                    swallowed after combat.
	
	POTION OF ALETHER:  increases COMBAT SKILL by 2 when 
	                    swallowed before combat.
	
	Each of these potions cost 3 Nobels (1 Nobel = 1 Gold ä	Crown). If you wish to purchase one or more of them, ä	adjust your ÈAction ChartÈ accordingly.
