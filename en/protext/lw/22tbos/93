	You leave the taverna and follow the road into 
	dense timberland. It is an uncomfortably hot and Š	humid region, and you are made to feel even more Š	uncomfortable by swarms of tiny insects that bite any Š	exposed areas of your flesh (lose 2 ENDURANCE Š	points). Judging by the number of bites you sustain, Š	you suspect that these insects consider Sommlending Š	flesh to be something of a delicacy. During your trek Š	to Jazer, unless you possess the discipline of Grand Š	Huntmastery, you must eat a Meal or lose a further 3 Š	ENDURANCE points.

	As the sun approaches the horizon, the road passes Š	across a high plateau before descending towards
	the shimmering green waters of the Jazer Strait. 
	The city of Jazer nestles in a wooded bay and you Š	arrive at its east gate shortly after sunset. A Š	notice board fixed to the gatehouse wall informs you Š	that you have missed the last ferry, a service which Š	carries road travellers across the strait to connect Š	with the trade road to Tiklu and beyond. The next Š	ferry leaves tomorrow morning at an hour after dawn. 

	It is a warm night, and as you wander through the Š	streets of this city, you contemplate where you Š	should best spend it.
