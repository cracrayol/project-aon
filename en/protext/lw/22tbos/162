	You see the deck of the trading ship come rushing Š	towards you, then, in the very next instant, your Š	vision is obliterated by a vivid white flash and you Š	are plunged into a dark and fathomless void. You have Š	been struck in the head by an arrow and your death is Š	mercifully swift.
	
	Tragically, your life and your quest end here beneath Š	the harbour bridge of Ghol-Tabras.
