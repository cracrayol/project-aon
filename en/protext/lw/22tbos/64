	The woman is disappointed that you will not pay her Š	charge and she asks you to leave her shop. As you are Š	walking to the door she calls out:
	
	"Zinair is well-known. Perhaps you should ask the Š	City Guards. They won't charge you for information."
	
	You thank her for the free advice and return to the Š	square. The City Guards seem to be the only option Š	left, and despite your feelings of unease, Š	reluctantly you approach them and ask for their Š	assistance.
