	You land a couple of feet short of the grassy edge Š	and fall headlong into the deep dark pit.	The base of Š	this trap does not contain sharpened stakes or any Š	other such deadly contrivances, yet it proves to be Š	just as fatal when you are knocked unconscious upon Š	hitting its rocky base. Tragically, you never regain Š	consciousness; the villagers close in and finish you Š	with their bows.
	
	Your life and your quest ends here.
