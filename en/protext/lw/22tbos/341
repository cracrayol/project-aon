	You wake within the hour and from then on you spend Š	an uncomfortable night during which you are bitten Š	constantly by the fleas which infest your mattress. Š	Your Kai curing skills protect you from contracting Š	any illness or infection from the bites, but you lose Š	3 ENDURANCE points due to your lack of rest.

	When the sun rises you decide to abandon your Š	attempts at sleeping. You check your equipment and Š	then you leave the tavern and walk to the nearby Š	ferry station. You can see the ferry approaching Š	across the strait. It is loaded with carts and horses Š	and more than a hundred people. A queue has formed at Š	the station gate where a ferryman is waiting to Š	collect the crossing fare. A board slung around his Š	chest informs you that the price of the crossing is 2 Š	Nobels.


	If you can afford the price of the crossing, turn 
	to  â188â

	If you do not have 2 Nobels, turn to  â287â
