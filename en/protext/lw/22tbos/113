	Radyard is clearly impressed by your act of ä	selflessness and he thanks you. He orders his crew to ä	hoist the sails, and he tells his bo'sun to wave a ä	white flag from the stern deck to signal to Sesketera ä	that he is complying with his command. A longboat is ä	launched from ÈThe TriasusÈ to collect you. It is ä	carrying an officer and six marines, each armed with ä	a half-pike and a Bor pistol. You present yourself to ä	the officer and he ties your hands with cord before ä	placing you aboard the boat. Radyard and his crew ä	watch grim-faced as the longboat pushes off and ä	begins its return run. Four of the marines are rowing ä	whilst the officer and the other two watch you ä	closely, the tips of their shortened naval pikes ä	never wandering far from the vicinity of your heart.	ä	You turn to look to the jungle shore, less than half ä	a mile distant, and suddenly a bold plan springs into ä	your mind.


	If you possess the discipline of Kai-surge, turn to  ä	‚37‚

	If you do not, turn to  ‚312‚
