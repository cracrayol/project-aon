	Quickly you take your musical instrument from your ä	backpack and play the first few verses of the ä	Eldenoran national anthem, entitled "Mighty Duadon". ä	The loutish Eldenorans begin to cheer and stamp on ä	the taproom floor in time to the music when they ä	recognise their banal battle song. Soon they are all ä	singing along, including the Captain who releases his ä	grip and lets the gasping crewman drop in a heap to ä	the taproom floor as he joins in with the chorus. 
	
	You motion to the others that now would be a good ä	time to leave. Without a word they move towards the ä	door, pausing only to pick up their injured comrade ä	as they go. The Eldenorans are soon singing so loudly ä	that they do not notice when you cease playing and ä	hurry out of the tavern. You join the others outside ä	and laugh with them at the incredible stupidity of ä	the Eldenorans. It is hollow laughter, but at least ä	it helps to relieve the frustration of having to ä	return early to ÈThe AzanÈ.
