	Soon the longboat abandons its search and returns to ä	ÈThe TriasusÈ. You watch as both ships unfurl their ä	sails and depart from the coast, ÈThe TriasusÈ heading ä	north and the ÈSeaspriteÈ sailing south. Sesketera must ä	be satisfied that you perished during your encounter ä	with the terrible Nigumu-sa. Your only regret is that ä	Captain Radyard and his crew probably believe this to ä	be true as well.

	When you can no longer see the two ships, you take ä	out your map and unfold it on the sand. Aided by your  ä	Kai tracking skills, you determine that you have come ä	ashore at the tip of a mainland peninsula, at a point ä	close to the Isle of Kobra. The nearest city is ä	Masama. It lies over 300 miles away to the south-ä	west, beyond a wide expanse of dense jungle and ä	hills. The thought of traversing this uncharted ä	territory, alone and on foot, is one that fills you ä	with dread. But you take comfort in the knowledge ä	that you survived your battle in the sea and that you ä	still possess the Moonstone. 
	
	You are tired and hungry after your ordeal. Unless ä	you possess the discipline of Grand Huntmastery, you ä	must now eat a Meal or lose 3 ENDURANCE points.
