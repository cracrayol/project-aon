	You go to the foot of the hatch ladder and recite the ä	words of the Brotherhood spell - ÈLevitationÈ. As you ä	rise, you guide yourself through the hatch and emerge ä	on the foredeck. Quickly you cancel the spell for ä	fear of becoming entangled in the rigging and ruined ä	sails that lie strewn across the decks of this doomed ä	trader. Every mast has fallen and the stern is slowly ä	submerging beneath the relentless waves. You scour ä	the shattered main deck but you can see no sign of ä	survivors. Then you glimpse a hand protruding from ä	beneath a mass of debris, and you stagger across the ä	shifting deck towards it. Suddenly the prow is struck ä	by a cresting wave and you are catapulted off the ä	deck and into the angry sea.
