	You draw upon your Animal Mastery skills in an Š	attempt to calm these frightened and hungry Š	creatures. They are susceptible to your powerful Š	psychic commands, yet they produce an unexpected and Š	adverse reaction. The sudden conflict of their Š	instincts and feelings makes them howl with Š	frustration. In a state of blind panic, the two wolf-Š	like animals rush past you to disappear into the Š	rainswept jungle. Confident that they will not Š	return, you settle yourself down upon a bed of soft Š	mosses and drift off to sleep.
