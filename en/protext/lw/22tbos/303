	The globes dance around your boat and their chilling Š	laughter echoes through the mist. Suddenly the Š	Moonstone and the satchel disappear and an icy Š	coldness invades your heart when you sense that you Š	have now fallen into the thrawl of these supernatural Š	beings. Tragically, you are doomed to spend the rest Š	of eternity a prisoner of this timeless void.
	
	Your life and your quest ends here in the Sea of Š	Mists.
