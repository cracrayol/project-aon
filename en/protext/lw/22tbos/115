	Using your advanced psychic skill, you focus upon the Š	heads of the rivets which fix the drawbolt to the Š	cell door, and you cause them to vibrate. It is a Š	slow and demanding task (lose 3 ENDURANCE points) but Š	eventually these rivets heat up, expand, and then Š	split. When the strength of their iron has been Š	sufficiently undermined, you are then able to wrench Š	open the cell door.
