	Fair weather returns and ÈThe AzanÈ makes good speed
	as it crosses the jade green waters of the Gulf of ä	Tentarium. It is shortly before noon of the following ä	day when the first glimpse of Zharloum is sighted by ä	the lookout, and less than an hour later you find ä	yourself sailing into the harbour of this grand city. ä	Emerald pennants flutter from the towers and roofs of ä	its sun-bleached houses, and crowds of industrious ä	citizens throng its paved avenues and alleyways. This ä	old Shadakine port has a long history of free and ä	fair trading. It is many miles from the cities of ä	Shadakine political power which lie to the south, and ä	due to this fortunate fact it has been spared much of ä	the damage wrought upon this troubled land by a ä	succession of ruthless and tyrannical rulers.
	
	The ship enters and docks at the harbour wall, close ä	to the jetty of a warehouse which contains the iron ä	and copper ingots that it will carry to Suhn. As the ä	crew begin the task of loading the cargo aboard, you ä	decide to go and explore this thriving city. But ä	after little more than an hour the heat, hustle, and ä	noise of the crowded streets becomes oppressive and ä	you find yourself yearning for somewhere quiet to ä	rest before you return to the ship. Looking around, ä	you notice two places which offer the promise of some ä	respite from the teeming crowds. The first is a ä	public park which stands upon a cliff that looms ä	above the city to the east of the harbour wall. The ä	second is a narrow deserted alley that wends its way ä	into the city's Old Quarter.
