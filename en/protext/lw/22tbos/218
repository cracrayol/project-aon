	You throw yourself to the deck and take cover behind ä	the wooden parapet of the prow as the enemy's shot ä	rips into the sails and rigging. Shredded canvas and ä	splintered timbers fall about your ears, yet you ä	survive this ferocious bombardment without sustaining ä	the slightest injury. Bravely Captain Jenkshi takes ä	over the helm and steers his battered ship ä	relentlessly towards the channel. You see him cursing ä	the enemy captain and shaking his fist defiantly at ä	the villainous Shadakine gunners as their cannonballs ä	whistle across the decks of ÈThe AzanÈ. Then a gust of ä	wind fills the torn mainsail and the ship begins to ä	pull away from the lumbering man o'war. A second ä	broadside falls wide of its mark, and Jenkshi's bold ä	plan finally pays off when the enemy ship is forced ä	to veer away for fear beaching her hull in the ä	shallows. The crew cheer loudly when they see her red ä	sails falling away to the stern, and ÈThe AzanÈ is left ä	alone to make a swift passage through the islet ä	channel. You pull yourself unsteadily to your feet ä	and make your way along the debris-strewn deck to ä	congratulate Jenkshi for his masterful display of ä	seamanship. He accepts your praise and the cheers of ä	his crew with a rueful smile, even though his skill ä	and his coolness under enemy fire have undoubtedly ä	saved the ship and the lives of all aboard. However, ä	as the ship emerges on the far side of the islets, ä	you soon discover that more than just Jenkshi's ä	bravery will be needed if everyone aboard ÈThe AzanÈ is ä	to live to tell the tale of their deadly encounter ä	with the buccaneers of Shadaki.
