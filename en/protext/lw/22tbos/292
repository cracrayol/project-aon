	As you race through the knee-high foliage you sense Š	danger ahead. Your mastery of Pathsmanship is warning Š	you that the undergrowth conceals a pit trap. As you Š	draw closer, you are able to detect the outline of a Š	trench that is over fifteen feet wide.


	If you wish to attempt to leap across this concealed Š	pit, turn to  â129â

	If you decide to halt and turn to face your pursuers, Š	go to  â27â
