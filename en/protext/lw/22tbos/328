	Using your advance camouflage skills, you draw your Š	Kai cloak tightly around yourself and stand close to Š	the wall of the hut. Then you scream long and loud, Š	as if in great pain, and wait for the guards to come. Š	The door opens and two natives armed with spears step Š	through into the gloomy interior. They fail to see Š	you where you are and immediately assume that you Š	have escaped. As they leave the hut to raise the Š	alarm, you are able to slip out through the open Š	door.
