	As you leap from the parapet of the harbour bridge, ä	you utter the words of the Brotherhood spell - ä	ÈInvisible ShieldÈ - to help protect yourself from the ä	arrows that are now whistling past on all sides. It ä	is a precaution that saves you from sustaining a ä	serious wound. As you fall, you see an arrow ä	deflected away from your chest by this invisible ä	barrier.
