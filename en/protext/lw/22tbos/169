	You focus on the creature and launch a Mindblast in ä	an attempt to force it to release your horse from its ä	terrible clutches. You sense that your attack has had ä	no effect upon this supernatural beast, and that it ä	possesses an innate resistence to psychic energy.

	Desperate now to save your stricken mount, you rush ä	forward and attack the creature with your Kai weapon.
