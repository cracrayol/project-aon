	You follow Melchar through a maze of passages which ä	lead all the way back to ÈThe Song of the Silver StarÈ ä	tavern, and the young journeyman laughs with sheer ä	relief at having escaped from Wrok's henchmen when ä	finally you enter the sanctuary of the inn's crowded ä	taproom. The innkeeper asks Melchar if his happy mood ä	is due to a win at the derby. He tells him that, ä	thanks to your advice, he did not bet and therefore ä	he did not lose. He also adds the real reason why he ä	is feeling elated and the innkeeper frowns.
	
	"Wrok's not a man to cross," he warns, "he's ruthless ä	when it comes to getting even. I think you two had ä	better stay in the attic tonight. Wrok's sure to send ä	his lackeys out a-huntin' for you."

	You heed the innkeeper's warning and spend the night ä	hidden in his attic room. Before dawn breaks you slip ä	out of the tavern by a back door and say farewell to ä	Melchar in the street outside. 

	"Captain Leonghi's ship is moored down at the docks," ä	he says. "It's called ÈEmbassageÈ. I wish you a swift ä	and safe journey to Nhang, Grand Master. I'll always ä	remember our little adventure at the Caeno Derby and ä	I hope we'll meet again one day when you return to ä	Sommerlund."
