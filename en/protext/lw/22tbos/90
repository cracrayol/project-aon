	The bolt hits you and a brilliant flash of white Š	light obliterates your senses: lose 8 ENDURANCE Š	points. For a few moments you lose consciousness, Š	then your senses return and you struggle to your Š	feet. Stunned and disorientated, you shake your head Š	in an effort to clear your blurred vision. Images Š	swirl before your eyes, weaving and coalescing to Š	create a fearful sight. The flickering night-creature Š	has fixed itself to the neck of your horse like some Š	nightmarish vampire. Tethered by his reins, your Š	mount is unable to escape from the leech-like maw of Š	this supernatural creature.
