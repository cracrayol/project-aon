	Speedily you draw and fire your arrow, sending it Š	thudding into the chest of the sniper before he can Š	reload his deadly blowpipe. The man tumbles out of Š	the branches to land heavily upon the exposed roots Š	of the tree. You hurry to his lifeless body and Š	discover, to your disappointment, that his blowpipe Š	is broken and his poisoned darts are somewhere in Š	among the boughs above. After you have hidden his Š	body in the undergrowth, you move deeper into the Š	jungle, guided and drawn by the strange noise.
