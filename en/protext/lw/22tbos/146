	By dawn the heavy rain has ceased and you get ready Š	to continue your trek. As you leave the cave you Š	notice that the bodies of the kholo have disappeared. Š	Tracks in the mud show that they have been claimed Š	during the night by larger nocturnal predators who Š	thrive in this untamed jungle.
	
	The rains have transformed the hill track into a Š	muddy ditch which makes the going difficult. Yet it Š	is still the quickest way through this territory and Š	you stay with the track until it comes to the bank of Š	the swollen River Ocka. There was once a bridge at Š	this point, but your Kai tracking skills inform you Š	that it has been washed away during the night. You Š	are about to set off along the bank in search of Š	somewhere to cross when suddenly you hear a desperate Š	cry for help. You turn and see a man being swept Š	downstream by the river. His head is barely above the Š	surface and you can see at once that he is near to Š	drowning.
