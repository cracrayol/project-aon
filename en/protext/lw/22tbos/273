	You have cause to be thankful for your Grand Mastery Š	when you detect the outline of a man's body high in Š	the boughs of a nearby tree. His limbs and torso are Š	painted with forest colours that help keep him Š	hidden, and you hazard a guess that he is a lookout Š	for a remote jungle tribe. 
	
	You sense that he has failed to detect your presense. Š	Rather than run the risk of being seen, you make a Š	wide detour around his tree before continuing deeper Š	into the jungle.
