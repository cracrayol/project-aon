	The guildsman takes great offence when you decline to ä	drink with him. He slams the decanter and glasses ä	onto his desk, then he orders you to leave his ä	chambers and never set foot in Coppersmiths Hall ever ä	again. 
	
	Outside the hall you rejoin the Suhnese crewmen and ä	hurry with them through the flagstoned streets of the ä	city, retracing your route back to the harbour in the ä	hope of reaching ÈThe AzanÈ before night closes in ä	completely. You are within a few hundred yards of the ä	harbour entrance when suddenly a patrol of the city ä	watch come marching around a corner with their spears ä	couched on their chainmailed shoulders. Their officer ä	commands you all to halt and demands that you raise ä	your hands above your heads.
	

	If you wish to do as the officer has ordered, turn to  ä	‚228‚
	
	If you decide to make a dash for the harbour, turn 
	to  ‚330‚
