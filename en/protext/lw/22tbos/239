	When you and the Captain return to the main deck of ä	the ÈSeaspriteÈ, Ghol-Tabras is little more than a tiny ä	speck shimmering on the far horizon. Your daring leap ä	from the harbour bridge is still the talk of the crew ä	and they are eager to shake your hand when Radyard ä	proudly shows you around his ship. The Siyenese are a 
	friendly crew with a keen sense of humour that they ä	readily share. You enjoy being in their company and ä	the next three days at sea pass effortlessly. On the ä	evening of the fourth day, Radyard drops anchor off ä	the coast at a place called 'Kastrow's Door'. It is a ä	narrow strait that runs between the jungle mainland ä	and the isle of Kobra. The night is calm and clear, ä	and the stirrings of a warm southerly breeze promises ä	fine sailing for the following day. Yet despite these ä	good omens you awaken next morning feeling ill at ä	ease. As you are leaving your cabin to go on deck, ä	suddenly you hear the lookout in the crow's nest ä	shout a warning that chills your blood: "Man o'war ä	off the starboard bow!"
