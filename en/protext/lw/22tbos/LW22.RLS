	                   THE GAME RULES

	You keep a record of your adventure on the ÈAction ä	ChartÈ that you will find in the front of this book. ä	For ease of use, and for further adventuring, it is ä	recommended that you photocopy these pages.

	During the years you have spent in training at the Kai ä	Monastery you have devoted yourself to further ä	developing your fighting prowess (COMBAT SKILL) and ä	physical stamina (ENDURANCE). Before you begin this ä	New Order adventure you need to measure how effective ä	your training has been. To do this take a pencil and, ä	with your eyes closed, point the blunt end of it on to ä	the ÈRandom Number TableÈ on the last page of the book. ä	If you pick a 0 it counts as zero.

	The first number that you pick from the ÈRandom Number ä	TableÈ in this way represents your COMBAT SKILL. Add 25 ä	to the number you picked and write the total in the ä	COMBAT SKILL section of your ÈAction ChartÈ (ie. if your ä	pencil fell on the number 7 in the ÈRandom Number TableÈ ä	you would write in a COMBAT SKILL of 32). When you ä	fight, your COMBAT SKILL will be pitted against that ä	of your enemy. A high score in this section is ä	therefore desirable.


	The second number that you pick from the ÈRandom Number ä	TableÈ represents your powers of ENDURANCE. Add 30 to ä	this number and write the total in the ENDURANCE ä	section of your ÈAction ChartÈ (ie. if your pencil fell ä	on the number 8 on the ÈRandom Number TableÈ you would ä	have 38 ENDURANCE points).

	If you are wounded in combat you will lose ENDURANCE ä	points. If at any time your ENDURANCE points fall to ä	zero, you are dead and the adventure is over. Lost ä	ENDURANCE points can be regained during the course of ä	the adventure, but your number of ENDURANCE points can ä	not rise above the number you have when you start an 
	adventure.

	‰If you have successfully completed the previous ä	adventure in the Lone Wolf New Order series (Book 21), ä	you can carry your current scores of‰‚ COMBAT SKILL‚‰ and ‰‚ ä	ENDURANCE‚‰ points over to this adventure. You may also ä	carry over any Special Items, Kai Weapon, normal ä	weapons and Backpack Items you had in your possession ä	at the end of your last adventure, and these should be ä	entered on your new ÈAction ChartÈ. 

	‚Playing Tip‚: You may use a 10-sided die instead of the ä	ÈRandom Number TableÈ if you find it more convenient.

	
	
	
		
       
	                   YOUR KAI NAME

	It has long been the tradition of your elite warrior ä	caste to bestow a new name upon each young novice when ä	they complete their first year's training at the Kai ä	Monastery. Kai names are chosen by senior Kai Masters ä	with the aim of reflecting the individual strengths ä	and qualities of each novice.	
	
	You may create your own Kai name for yourself, or you ä	can generate a Kai name at random using the name ä	tables below. To generate a Kai name, pick a number ä	from the ÈRandom Number TableÈ and consult Table A. The ä	name which co-responds to the number you have picked ä	is the first part, or prefix, of your Kai name. Now ä	pick a second number from the ÈRandom Number TableÈ and ä	consult Table B.  The name which co-responds to the ä	number you have picked is the second part, or suffix, ä	of your Kai name. Put the prefix and the suffix ä	together and you have your own personal Kai name. You ä	can record your personal Kai name on the book plate ä	which appears on the inside front cover of this book.








	       TABLE A                   TABLE B  
	  (Kai name prefix)         (Kai name suffix)
	      0  =  Swift               0  = Blade
	      1  =  Sun                 1  = Fire

	      9  =  Brave               9  = Shield  


	            KAI & MAGNAKAI DISCIPLINES
	
	During your distinguished rise to the ranks of the New ä	Order of Kai Grand Masters, you have become proficient ä	in all of the basic Kai and Magnakai Disciplines. ä	These disciplines provide you with a formidable ä	arsenal of natural abilities which will serve you ä	well. A brief summary of your skills is given below:

	‚Weaponmastery‚
	You are proficient with all close combat and missile ä	weapons. You are a master of unarmed combat and suffer ä	no COMBAT SKILL loss when fighting bare-handed.

	‚Animal Control‚

	‚Curing‚
	You are able to restore ENDURANCE points lost as a ä	direct result of combat. You may restore 1 ENDURANCE ä	point for every numbered section of the book you pass ä	through in which you are not involved in further ä	combat. The maximum number of ENDURANCE points that ä	can be restored in this way is limited to 10 per ä	adventure. 
	You also possess the ability to heal the wounds of ä	others, and you can neutralise the harmful effects of ä	most poisons, venoms and toxins.

	‚Invisibility‚
	You can hide effectively in most environments, mask ä	any sounds made during movement, and you can cause ä	minor alterations of your own physical appearance. ä	Also you are able to mask your own body heat and ä	scent.

	‚Huntmastery‚
	You are an expert hunter of food in the wild. You ä	possess great physical agility and a keen sense of ä	vision (day and night). Your senses of hearing and ä	smell are especially acute.


	‚Pathsmanship‚
	You are able to understand most languages, magical ä	symbols and hieroglyphics. You are expert at reading ä	footprints and tracks. You have an intuitive knowledge ä	of the compass points and can detect the threat of an ä	enemy ambush up to a distance 500 yds. You possess an ä	ability to cross terrain without leaving tracks. You ä	can converse with sentient creatures and mask yourself ä	from psychic spells of detection.

	‚Psi-surge‚
	You are able to attack enemies using the powers of ä	your mind. Also you can set up disruptive vibrations ä	in inanimate objects and cause confusion in the minds ä	of unsophisticated enemies.

	‚Psi-screen‚
	You possess strong mental defences against hypnosis, ä	supernatural illusions, charms, hostile telepathy, and ä	evil spirits. You are able to divert and re-channel ä	some hostile psychic energy to your own ends.

	‚Nexus‚
	You can move small items by projection of your mind ä	power. You can withstand extremes of temperature and ä	are able to extinguish fire by force of your will ä	alone. You have a limited immunity to flames, toxic 
	gases, and corrosive liquids.


	‚Divination‚
	Your famous Kai sixth sense can warn you of imminent ä	danger. You can detect invisible or hidden enemies, ä	and you are able to communicate telepathically. You ä	can recognize magic-using and/or magical creatures, ä	detect psychic residues, and you have a limited ä	ability to leave your corporeal body ("spirit-walk") ä	for short periods.


  	       NEW ORDER KAI GRAND MASTER DISCIPLINES

	After years of martial training and study at the Kai ä	Monastery, and by the rigorous practice of the ä	teachings of your illustrious mentor - Kai Supreme ä	Master Lone Wolf - you have achieved the noble rank of  ä	Kai Grand Master Senior.
	
	Following in the footsteps of Lone Wolf himself, you ä	have vowed that one day you will become totally ä	proficient in all sixteen of the New Order Kai Grand ä	Master Disciplines. By doing so successfully you will ä	share with Lone Wolf the responsibility, the honour, ä	and the future glory of leading the New Order Kai as a ä	Supreme Master.

       If this is the first New Order adventure you have ä	undertaken then your present rank is that of Kai Grand ä	Master Senior. This means that you have mastered ÈfourÈ ä	of the New Order Grand Master Disciplines listed ä	below. It is for you to decide which four disciplines ä	these are. As all of the New Order Grand Master ä	Disciplines will be of use to you at some point during ä	your mission, pick these four skills with care. The ä	correct use of a New Order Grand Master Discipline at ä	the right time could save your life. When you have ä	chosen your four disciplines, enter them in the Grand ä	Master Disciplines section of your ÈAction ChartÈ.
	
	‚1.  Grand Weaponmastery‚
	This discipline enables a New Order Grand Master to ä	become supremely efficient in the use of all weapons. ä	When you enter combat armed with one of your Grand ä	Master weapons, you may add 5 points to your COMBAT ä	SKILL. The rank of Kai Grand Master Senior, with which ä	you begin the New Order series, means that you are ä	skilled in the use of ÈoneÈ of the weapons listed in the ä	EQUIPMENT section. For every adventure that you ä	complete successfully in the New Order series, you ä	will gain proficiency with one additional weapon. 

	‚2.  Animal Mastery‚
	New Order Grand Masters have considerable control over ä	hostile, non-sentient creatures. Also, they have the ä	ability to converse with birds and fishes, and use ä	them as guides.
	
	‚3.  Deliverance‚ (ÈAdvanced CuringÈ)
	New Order Grand Masters are able to use their healing ä	power to repair serious battle wounds. If, whilst in ä	combat, their COMBAT SKILL is reduced to 8 points or ä	less, they can draw upon their mastery to restore 20 ä	ENDURANCE points. This emergency ability can only be ä	used once every 20 days. 
	
	‚4.  Assimilance‚ (ÈAdvanced InvisibilityÈ)
	New Order Grand Masters are able to effect striking ä	changes to their physical appearance, and maintain ä	these changes over a period of 1-3 days. They also ä	have mastered advanced camouflage techniques which ä	make them virtually undetectable in an open landscape.

	‚5.  Grand Huntmastery‚
	New Order Grand Masters are able to see in total ä	darkness and they possess great natural speed and ä	agility. They also have a superb sense of touch and ä	taste.
	
	‚6.  Grand Pathsmanship‚
	New Order Grand Masters are able to resist entrapment ä	by hostile plants. Also they have a super-awareness of ä	ambush, or the threat of ambush, in woods and dense ä	forests.
	
	‚7.  Kai-surge‚
	When using their psychic ability to attack an enemy, ä	New Order Grand Masters may add 8 points to their ä	COMBAT SKILL. For every round in which Kai-surge is ä	used, they need only deduct 1 ENDURANCE point. Grand ä	Masters have the option of using a weaker form of ä	psychic attack called ‚Mindblast‚. When using this ä	lesser attack, they may add 4 points to their COMBAT ä	SKILL without loss of ENDURANCE points (Kai-surge and ä	Mindblast cannot be used simultaneously). New Order ä	Grand Masters cannot use Kai-surge if their ENDURANCE ä	score falls to 6 points or below.

	‚8.  Kai-screen‚     
	During psychic combat, New Order Grand Masters are ä	able to construct mind fortresses capable of ä	protecting themselves and others. The strength and ä	capacity of these fortresses increases as a New Order ä	Grand Master advances in rank.    

	‚9.  Grand Nexus‚
	New Order Grand Masters are able to withstand contact ä	with harmful elements, such as flames and acids, for ä	upwards of an hour in duration. This ability increases ä	as a New Order Grand Master advances in rank.
	
	‚10. Telegnosis‚ (ÈAdvanced DivinationÈ)
	This discipline enables a New Order Grand Master to ä	spirit-walk for far greater lengths of time, and with ä	far fewer ill effects. Duration of the spirit-walk, ä	and the protection afforded to his inanimate body, ä	increases as a New Order Grand Master advances in 
	rank.
	
	‚11. Magi-Magic‚ (ÈOld Kingdom MagicÈ)
	Under the tutelage of Lone Wolf, you have been able     
	to master the rudimentary skills of Old Kingdom battle ä	magic. These arcane skills include the use of basic ä	magi-magic spells, such as ÈShieldÈ, ÈPower WordÈ, and ä	ÈInvisible FistÈ. As you advance in rank, so will your ä	knowledge and mastery of Old Kingdom magic increase.                                   
	       
	‚12. Kai-alchemy‚ (ÈBrotherhood MagicÈ)                                       
	Under the tutelage of Lone Wolf and Guildmaster ä	Banedon (the leader of Sommerlund's guild of ä	magicians), you have mastered the elementary spells of ä	the Brotherhood of the Crystal Star. These spells ä	include ÈLightning HandÈ, ÈLevitationÈ, and ÈMindÈ      
	ÈCharmÈ. As you advance in rank, so will your knowledge ä	and mastery of Brotherhood magic increase.
	
	‚13. Astrology‚
	The celestial bodies which occupy the skies above ä	Magnamund have long been known to effect the lives of ä	its inhabitants. Mastery of this discipline enables a ä	New Order Grand Master to predict and shape the future ä	by studying the relative positions of the Sun, the ä	Moon, and the myriad planets and stars. The number and ä	accuracy of these predictions increases as a New Order ä	Grand Master advances in rank. 

	‚14. Herbmastery‚
	Mastery of this New Order Discipline enables a Grand ä	Master to readily identify any substance derived from ä	living or growing organic material. He is aware of any ä	secret uses to which an organic material may be put, ä	and he is skilled in effecting the release of a ä	substance's medicinal and/or magical properties.

	‚15. Elementalism‚
	This discipline enables a New Order Grand Master to ä	manipulate the four basic elements: Earth, Air, Fire, ä	and Water. By drawing upon individual (or combinations ä	of) elements that are available, he is able to detach, ä	affix, increase, concentrate, intensify, remove or ä	accelerate this matter to fulfil a specific purpose, ä	eg. create a wall, hurl a rock, spray sand, remove ä	air, intensify fire. The versatility of this ä	discipline increases as a New Order Grand Master ä	advances in rank. 
	
	‚16. Bardsmanship‚
	Through mastery of this discipline a Kai Grand Master ä	of the New Order becomes a multi-talented performer, ä	proficient in the use of any musical instrument. He is ä	able to sing or chant, recite or compose tales of ä	legend, mimic speech or dialect and stimulate a wide ä	range of emotions among sentient creatures. The effect ä	and power of his bardic abilities will steadily ä	increase as he advances through the Grand Master ä	ranks.
	

	If you successfully complete the mission as set in ä	Book 22 of the Lone Wolf (New Order) series, you may ä	add a further Grand Master Discipline of your choice ä	to your ÈAction ChartÈ in Book 23. For every Grand ä	Master Discipline you possess, in excess of the ä	original four disciplines you begin with, you may add ä	1 point to your basic COMBAT SKILL score and 2 points ä	to your basic ENDURANCE points score. These bonus ä	points, together with your extra Grand Master ä	Discipline(s), your original four Grand Master ä	Disciplines, your Kai Weapon and any other Special ä	Items that you have found and been able to keep during ä	your adventures, may then be carried over and used in ä	the next New Order adventure, which is called: 
	               ÈMydnight's HeroÈ
	

	                    EQUIPMENT

	Before you leave Elzian and begin your long voyage ä	south to the Isle of Lorn, you take with you a map of ä	south-eastern Magnamund (see the inside front cover of ä	this book) and a pouch of gold. To find out how much ä	gold is in the pouch, pick a number from the ÈRandom ä	Number TableÈ and add 20 to the number you have picked. ä	The total equals the number of Gold Crowns inside the ä	pouch, and you should now enter this number in the ä	'Gold Crowns' section of your ÈAction ChartÈ.
	‰If you have successfully completed the previous New ä	Order adventure (Book 21), you may add this sum to the ä	total sum of Crowns you already possess. Fifty is the ä	maximum number of Gold Crowns you can carry in your ä	pouch at any time. You may also select five items from ä	the list below, only two of which may be Weapons.                           

	QUARTERSTAFF (Weapons)
	                       Èa / wÈ
	BOW (Weapons)
	                       Èa / wÈ
	
	QUIVER (Special Items). This contains six arrows;                         
	                record them on your Weapons List. 
	                       Èa / wÈ
	FLUTE (Backpack Item)
	                       Èa / wÈ
	DAGGER (Weapons)
	                       Èa / wÈ
	SWORD  (Weapons)
	                       Èa / wÈ
	2 MEALS (Meals) Each Meal takes up one space in your
	                Backpack.
	                       Èa / wÈ
	ROPE (Backpack Item)
	                       Èa / wÈ
	POTION OF LAUMSPUR  (Backpack Item) This potion   ä	restores 4 ENDURANCE points to your total when   ä	swallowed after combat. There is enough for only 
	  one dose.
	                       Èa / wÈ

	AXE (Weapons)
	                       Èa / wÈ

       List the five items that you have chosen on your ä	ÈAction ChartÈ, under the appropriate headings, and make ä	a note of any effect that they may have to your ä	ENDURANCE points and/or COMBAT SKILL.


>------L------------------------!---------------------------R
	                    KAI WEAPONS

	Upon reaching the ultimate rank of Kai Supreme Master, ä	Lone Wolf received as a reward from the God Kai many ä	new skills and abilities. One of these skills was Kai ä	Weaponcraft. Using his new-found mastery, Lone Wolf ä	forged ten weapons of magical power in the armoury ä	furnaces of the Kai Monastery. These magical weapons ä	are reserved for the elite of the New Order Kai who ä	attain the rank of Grand Master. 
	
	In recognition of your rank and achievement, you may ä	choose your own Kai Weapon from the table below or, if ä	you prefer, you can generate one at random. To ä	generate a Kai Weapon, pick a number from the ÈRandom ä	Number TableÈ and consult the first column. The magical ä	axe, sword, or broadsword which co-responds to the ä	number you have picked will be your own personal Kai ä	Weapon. Record this magical weapon and its unique ä	properties in the Kai Weapon section of the Special ä	Items List at the front of the book. 
	
	‚Example‚ 
	Say you choose the number 8 from the ÈRandom Number ä	TableÈ, your Kai Weapon will be the broadsword ä	'Illuminatus'. 
	
	When using this Kai Weapon in normal combat you may ä	add +5 points to your COMBAT SKILL. Each Kai Weapon ä	has a unique property. When you use your Kai Weapon in ä	combat against the type of enemy that matches its ä	unique property, or use it at the optimum time or ä	location, then you may add the higher bonus to your ä	COMBAT SKILL.

	‚Example‚
	If you were to use 'Illuminatus' in combat against an ä	enemy in an underground cavern, cave or tunnel, you ä	could add the higher bonus of +7 to your COMBAT SKILL. ä	If you were to fight this enemy in any other location, ä	the bonus to your COMBAT SKILL would remain at +5.

	‚Equipment - How to use it‚

	ÈWeaponsÈ
	The maximum number of weapons that you can carry is ä	ÈtwoÈ. Weapons aid you in combat. If you have the Grand ä	Master Discipline of Grand Weaponmastery and a correct ä	weapon, it adds ‚5‚ points to your COMBAT SKILL. If you ä	find a weapon during your adventure, you may pick it ä	up and use it. 

	ÈBows and ArrowsÈ
	During your adventure there will be opportunities to ä	use a bow and arrow. If you equip yourself with this ä	weapon, and you possess at least one arrow, you may ä	use it when the text of a particular section allows ä	you to do so. The bow is a useful weapon, for it ä	enables you to hit an enemy at a distance. However, a ä	bow cannot be used in hand-to-hand combat, therefore ä	it is best to equip yourself also with a close combat 
	weapon, such as a sword or an axe.
	
	In order to use a bow you must possess a quiver and at ä	least one arrow. Each time the bow is used, erase an ä	arrow from your ÈAction ChartÈ. A bow cannot, of course, ä	be used if you exhaust your supply of arrows, but the ä	opportunity may arise during your mission for you to ä	replenish your stock of arrows.
	
	If you have the discipline of Grand Weaponmastery with ä	a bow, you may add 3 points to any number you choose ä	from the ÈRandom Number TableÈ, when using the bow.

	ÈBackpack ItemsÈ
	These must be stored in your Backpack. Because space ä	is limited, you may keep a maximum of ten articles, ä	including Meals, in your Backpack at any one time. You ä	may only carry one Backpack at a time. During your ä	travels you will discover various useful items which ä	you may decide to keep. You may exchange or discard ä	them at any point when you are not involved in combat.
	
	Any item that may be of use, and which can be picked ä	up on your adventure and entered on your ÈAction ChartÈ, ä	is given either initial capitals (eg. Silver Mirror, ä	Gold Key), or is clearly identified as a Backpack ä	item. Unless you are told that it is a Special Item, ä	carry it in your Backpack.

	ÈSpecial ItemsÈ
	Special Items are not carried in the Backpack. When ä	you discover a Special Item, you will be told how or ä	where to carry it.  The maximum number of Special ä	Items that can be carried on any adventure is twelve.

	ÈKai WeaponÈ
	Your Kai Weapon is a Special Item and it can be ä	carried and used in addition to two normal weapons. 
	If you possess the discipline of Grand Weaponmastery ä	for a weapon type which is the same as your unique Kai ä	Weapon, you may add the Grand Weaponmastery bonus of ä	+5 to your COMBAT SKILL. This is in addition to the ä	bonus gained when you use your Kai Weapon in combat.   

	ÈFoodÈ
	Food is carried in your Backpack. Each Meal counts as ä	one item. You will need to eat regularly during your ä	adventure. If you do not have any food when you are ä	instructed to eat a Meal, you will lose 3 ENDURANCE ä	points. However, if you have chosen Grand Huntmastery ä	as one of your four disciplines then you will not need ä	to tick off a Meal when instructed to eat.

	ÈPotion of LaumspurÈ
	This is a healing potion that can restore 4 ENDURANCE ä	points to your total when swallowed after combat. ä	There is enough for one dose only. If you discover any ä	other potion during the adventure, you will be ä	informed of its effect. All potions are Backpack ä	Items.


	                  RULES FOR COMBAT

	There will be occasions during your adventure when you ä	will have to fight an enemy. The enemy's COMBAT SKILL ä	and ENDURANCE points are given in the text. Your aim ä	in the combat is to kill the enemy by reducing his ä	ENDURANCE points to zero while losing as few ENDURANCE ä	points as possible yourself.

	At the start of a combat, enter your own and the ä	enemy's ENDURANCE points in the appropriate boxes on 
       the ıCombat Recordı section of your ÈAction ChartÈ.

	The sequence for combat is as follows:

	1. Add any extra points gained through your Grand 
	   Master Disciplines and Special Items to your    
	   current COMBAT SKILL total.

	2. Subtract the COMBAT SKILL of your enemy from this
	   total. The result is your ‚Combat Ratio‚. Enter it on
	   the ÈAction ChartÈ.

	  ‚ Example‚                                                 
	   You, Grand Master (COMBAT SKILL 32), are attacked 
	   in a forest by a pack of Wild Dogs (COMBAT SKILL 
	   31). You are taken by surprise and are not given 
	   the opportunity of evading their attack. You 
	   possess the Grand Master Discipline of Kai-surge to 
	   which the Wild Dogs are not immune, so you add 8 
	   points to your COMBAT SKILL. You also possess the 
	   Kai Weapon "Ulnarias", so you add an additional 5 
	   points to your COMBAT SKILL. This gives you a total 
	   COMBAT SKILL of 45.                
		                                                       
	   You now subtract the Wild Dogs' COMBAT SKILL from    
	   your own, giving a ÈCombat RatioÈ of +14 (45-31=+14).     
	   ‚+14‚ is noted on your ÈAction ChartÈ as the ÈCombat 
	   RatioÈ. 

	3. When you have your Combat Ratio, pick a number from
	   the ÈRandom Number TableÈ.

	4. Turn to the COMBAT RESULTS TABLE on the inside back
	   cover of this book. Along the top of the chart are
	   shown the ÈCombat RatioÈ numbers. Find the number
	   that is the same as your ÈCombat RatioÈ and cross-
	   reference it with the random number that you have
	   picked (the random numbers appear on the side of
	   the chart). You now have the number of ENDURANCE
	   points lost by both yourself and your enemy in this
	   round of combat. (ÈEÈ represents points lost by the
	   enemy; ÈGMÈ represents points lost by yourself - 
	   ‚G‚rand ‚M‚aster)


	   ‚Example‚                                             
	   The Combat Ratio between you and the Wild Dogs 
	   has been established as +14. If the number     
	   picked from the ÈRandom Number TableÈ is a È1È, then     
	   the result of the first round of combat is:         
	                                                       
	   You (GM) lose 3 ENDURANCE points (plus an         
	   additional 1 point for using Kai-surge. This loss   
	   is in addition to the loss suffered as a result of  
	   combat)                                             
	   Wild Dogs lose 9 ENDURANCE points.             


	5. On the ÈAction ChartÈ, mark the changes in ENDURANCE    
	   points to the participants in the combat.
	
	6. Unless otherwise instructed, or unless you have an  
	   option to evade, the next round of combat now 
	   starts.

	7. Repeat the sequence from Stage 3.

	This process of combat continues until the ENDURANCE ä	points of either your enemy or yourself are reduced to ä	zero, at which point the one with the zero score is ä	declared dead. If you are declared dead, the adventure ä	is over. If the enemy is dead, you can proceed but ä	with your ENDURANCE points reduced.

	‚A summary of Combat Rules appears on the page after ä	the ÈRandom Number TableÈ.‚

	‚Evasion of combat‚
	During your adventure you may be given the chance to ä	evade combat. If you have already engaged in a round ä	of combat and decide to evade, calculate the combat ä	for that round in the usual manner. All points lost by ä	the enemy as a result of that round are ignored, and ä	you make your escape. Only ‚you‚ may lose ENDURANCE ä	points during that round (such is the risk of turning ä	tail and running away during combat)! You may only ä	evade if the text of the particular section allows you ä	to do so.

	        IMPROVED GRAND MASTER DISCIPLINES

	As you rise through the higher levels of Kai Grand ä	Mastery you will find that your disciplines will ä	steadily improve. If you are a New Order Kai who has ä	attained the rank of Kai Grand Master Superior, you ä	will now benefit from improvements to the following ä	Grand Master Disciplines:
	
	‚Animal Mastery‚
	Kai Grand Master Superiors who possess this discipline ä	are able to deter predatory animals in the wild by ä	exuding a scent which is repellent to them. In order ä	for this improved discipline to work effectively, a ä	Grand Master Superior must be aware of the species of ä	predatory animal he/she wishes to deter. The scent can ä	only be detected by the targetted animal.
	
	‚Assimilance‚
	Kai Grand Master Superiors who possess this skill are ä	able to create a noise and project it up to 50 feet ä	away from their location. The noise is akin to the ä	rumbling sound of thunder and it can be used to ä	distract or divert an enemy's attention. This improved ä	discipline requires a degree of preparation and ä	therefore it cannot be used during combat. 
	
	‚Astrology‚
	Kai Grand Master Superiors who possess this discipline ä	are skilled in the use of all mechanical devices ä	designed to measure and/or observe the cosmology of ä	Magnamund. Such devices include sextants, astrolabes, ä	and orreries.

	‚Herbmastery‚
	Kai Grand Master Superiors who have this discipline ä	are able to purify water thereby making contaminated ä	or briny water suitable for consumption. Roughly two ä	pints of water per day can be purified using this ä	skill alone. This daily total steadily increases as a ä	Grand Master advances in rank.                                            

	‚Elementalism‚
	Kai Grand Master Superiors who possess this skill are ä	able to condense pure water out of the surrounding ä	air. This water can be made to fall as a fine spray or ä	as a sudden deluge. It can also be made to fill any ä	suitable container or receptacle. Using this skill, ä	Grand Master Superiors can create the equivalent of ä	one large bucketful of fresh water.

	‚Bardsmanship‚
	Kai Grand Master Superiors who possess this discipline ä	are able to utilize their musical skills to pacify
	an excited or hostile animal.  
	
	The nature of additional improvements and how they ä	affect your existing Grand Master Disciplines will be ä	noted in the 'Improved Grand Master Disciplines' ä	section of future Lone Wolf New Order books.
                         NEW ORDER WISDOM 

	You are about to embark upon the final stage of a ä	vital mission to return the fabled Moonstone of the ä	Shianti to its creators.

	Some of the material items that you will encounter ä	during your quest will be of use to you, while others ä	may be red herrings of no real value at all. If you ä	discover items, be selective in what you choose to ä	keep. 

	Pick your four Grand Master Disciplines with care for ä	a wise choice will enable any player to complete the ä	quest, no matter how weak their initial COMBAT SKILL ä	and ENDURANCE scores may be. Completion of previous ä	Lone Wolf adventures (books 1-21) may be advantageous, ä	but it is not essential for the successful completion ä	of this New Order adventure.

	May the light of the gods Kai and Ishir guide you ä	during your important quest.
