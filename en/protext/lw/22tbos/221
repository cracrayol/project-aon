	The City Guard patrol confiscate your weapons Š	(including your Kai Weapon) and march you out of the Š	square under close escort. You are taken to a black-Š	stoned citadel called the Hall of Correction, a dour Š	building that was constructed by order of Mother Š	Magri - the former Steward of Suhn - during the reign Š	of the hated Wytch-king Shasarak. 

	You are brought before a pompous Guard Officer called Š	Hiojin who refuses to believe that you are a Š	messenger from Elzian here to meet with Lord Zinair. Š	He believes you are a hired assassin. 

	"These are troubled times. There are men abroad who Š	would seek to harm Lord Zinair. I cannot allow this. Š	It is my duty to protect the ambassadors to our great Š	city." 

	When you steadfastly refuse to change your story, the Š	officer scratches his pock-marked chin and narrows Š	his beady eyes. 

	"Perhaps you have some proof that what you say is Š	true ?" he says, as he stares at your satchel.
