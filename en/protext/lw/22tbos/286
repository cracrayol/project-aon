	After only a few seconds of manipulation the lock Š	clicks open. You discard the nail and then reach for Š	the handle and twist it. To your relief, the heavy Š	door creaks open to reveal a flight of spiral stairs Š	which ascend into darkness above. 
	
	Hurriedly you climb these stone steps and come to a Š	landing where several corridors converge. Some are Š	occupied by gaolers and other officials of Š	Sesketera's citadel who are going about their duties. Š	Then you hear the sound of footsteps ascending the Š	spiral stairs behind you, and this sound reminds you Š	of the pressing need to keep moving. You draw upon Š	your Magnakai dsiciplines of Huntmastery and Š	Pathsmanship to help you choose the best route and, Š	to your surprise, in so doing you discover a secret Š	panel in the wall at the head of the spiral Š	staircase. You reach out and press a raised stud and Š	the concealed panel slides open to reveal a narrow Š	passageway beyond. Quickly you enter this passage and Š	the panel automatically clicks shut behind you.
