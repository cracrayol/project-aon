	You are awoken in the middle of the night by a Š	hideous cry. Your horse is startled and terrified by Š	this gruesome sound, and he tugs frantically against Š	his reins. Seconds later you are up on your feet, Š	your keen eyes scouring your surroundings for some Š	sign of the threat. Your Kai skills are alerting you Š	to an imminent and deadly danger, a hidden enemy who Š	possesses a strong magical aura.

	You unsheathe your Kai weapon and crouch behind a Š	boulder. Suddenly the air before you shimmers and Š	takes form, causing you to gasp in disbelief. Š	Something is growing out of the very darkness itself! Š	You glimpse its misshapen head and hunched body, then Š	its outline seems to waver. It flickers and sparkles, Š	as if it is caught between two planes of existence. Š	Suddenly there is a brilliant flash and a sparkling Š	arc of energy leaps from the shimmering mirage to Š	come speeding towards your face.
