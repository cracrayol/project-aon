	As you tumble over the side of the boat, the tip of ä	the officer's half-pike scrapes along your ribs and ä	gouges your arm: lose 4 ENDURANCE points.

	You sink like a stone, but your Magnakai discipline ä	of Nexus soon frees you from the cord that binds your ä	wrists and you are able to strike out for the distant ä	shore. Only once you have passed beyond the shadow of ä	Sesketera's flagship do you dare come up for air. As ä	you break the surface, you notice that the crew of ä	ÈThe TriasusÈ are scouring the sea, straining ä	themselves to catch a glimpse of where you are. A ä	marine on the prow deck spots you and, to your ä	surprise, Sesketera's crew begin to laugh and jeer.

	You are trying to fathom the reason for their ä	laughter when suddenly you are struck in the back by ä	a heavy, powerful blow.

	Pick a number from the ÈRandom Number TableÈ. If the ä	number you have chosen is odd (ie. 1,3,5,7,9) reduce ä	your ENDURANCE score by 3. If the number you have ä	chosen is even (ie. 0,2,4,6,8) reduce your ENDURANCE ä	score by 5.

	If you have survived your wounds, turn to  ‚243‚
