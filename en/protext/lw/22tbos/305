	The man shrieks with rage and curses you in a vile ä	language that you do not recognise. Yet the sound of ä	his words sends a shiver of dread coursing down your ä	spine, like a trickle of icy cold water. He denounces ä	you as an agent of the City Council sent to spy on ä	their meeting, and he orders the group to attack and ä	slay you. The men react slowly to his frantic ä	commands. It is as if they are struggling to awaken ä	from a deep sleep. You have no wish to fight these ä	men and so you turn and run towards the park entrance ä	to escape from them. As you reach the open gate, you ä	glance over your shoulder to see that the bald man is ä	preparing to hurl a dagger at your back.
