	You attempt to rally the Suhnese to fight, but they ä	are unarmed and they have no battle training. Quickly ä	it becomes clear to you that if you force them to ä	resist the city watch, you will be condemning them to ä	needless injury or death. Wary of this, you attempt ä	to lure the Shadakine soldiers away into one of the ä	houses. Unfortunately, your brave effort is short-ä	lived. The city guard pursue you and quickly ä	overpower you by their sheer weight of numbers: lose ä	3 ENDURANCE points.

	Once you have been effectively subdued, the city ä	watch round up the Suhnese and guard you all at ä	spear-point until two horse-drawn wagons arrive to ä	take you away to the city gaol. As you are herded ä	aboard these foul-smelling carriages, your weapons, ä	Kai Weapon, and backpack items are confiscated and ä	dumped into a wooden crate beside the driver's seat. ä	(On your ÈAction ChartÈ mark each of these items with ä	an asterisk [*] to indicate that they are no longer ä	in your possession, but do not erase them at this ä	time. Any Special Items you possess are allowed to ä	remain with you.)
	
	At the officer's command the wagons move off at a ä	speedy pace. After a few bruising minutes your wagon ä	emerges from the gloomy streets and ascends a smooth ä	ramp which passes through the daunting gate of Ghol-ä	Tabras gaol. Above this gate flutters a flag which ä	depicts a black serpent entwined around the blade of ä	a silver scimitar. It is the personal emblem of ä	Sesketera, the ruler of this city, a man not known ä	for his kindness nor his mercy.
