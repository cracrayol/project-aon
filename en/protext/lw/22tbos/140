	The bridge continues to sway and you find it Š	increasingly difficult to keep your horse from Š	rearing up in panic. Suddenly a group of native Š	bandits emerge from the jungle behind you and they Š	gather around the entrance to the bridge. The tallest Š	man is carrying an axe. He grasps one of the heavy Š	ropes which anchor the bridge, and he raises his axe Š	threateningly. Again you hear the voice echoing from Š	the crevice, repeating its demand that you cast all Š	of your possessions into the gorge.
