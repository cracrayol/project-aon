	You take a torch from its bracket in the wall and ä	hurl it down the corridor. Then, using your Kai ä	camouflage skills, you press yourself into a shadowy ä	recess in the wall and remain completely still. The ä	guards hear something clatter along the floor outside ä	their room and they react immediately. They grab ä	fresh torches and rush to investigate both the noise ä	and the sudden dimness that has enveloped the ä	corridor. The moment they step through the doorway, ä	your hiding place is illuminated by the glare of ä	their fresh torches.
