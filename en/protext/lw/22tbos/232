	You place the Nobels into your belt pouch and the Š	youth thanks you for your custom. As you turn to Š	leave, he suggests that you ask after Captain Radyard Š	at the tavern. You bid him goodbye and you heed his Š	advice. As soon as you leave the emporium you make Š	your way directly to the Freetrader's Tavern.

	You push open the swing doors and enter a crowded Š	taproom. Never have you seen so many different types Š	of people and faces together in one place before, and Š	it takes you a few moments to get over your initial Š	surprise. Nobody pays you a second glance as you push Š	your way through this exotic crowd of traders and Š	travellers and make your way to the counter.

	When you find the landlord you ask if he knows or has Š	heard of Captain Radyard. The man laughs like a drain Š	and nods his head enthusiastically.

	"Yes, yes, oh yes...Radyard. Him and his men stay Š	here two nights ago. Fine men...good drinkers...fine Š	fellows. They come here always when in Masama."

	The landlord goes on to say that he has not seen them Š	since. He suggests that you ask at the Masama Š	Warehouse. It is the place where they usually sell Š	their cargo. You thank the landlord and turn to Š	leave. As you reach the exit, you are tapped on the Š	shoulder by a weasel-faced man who begs for a moment Š	of your time.

	"Excuse me, sir," he says, "but I overheard you Š	asking for Captain Radyard. I know the Captain and I Š	can take you to him. Only...well, I've a great thirst Š	and I'm in sore need of some ale. Perhaps you would Š	buy me an ale ? Then I'd gladly take you to the Š	Captain."
