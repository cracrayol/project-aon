	Suddenly your Kai sixth sense alerts you to danger ä	located somewhere above. You look to the canopy of ä	branches and see the outline of a man lying in the ä	boughs of a nearby tree. His limbs and torso are ä	daubed with forest colours that keep him hidden. You ä	hear a faint noise, and then you freeze with fear ä	when you recognise it to be the sound of a blowpipe.

	Pick a number from the ÈRandom Number TableÈ. If you ä	possess Grand Huntmastery, add  ‚3‚  to the number you ä	have chosen.


	If your total is now  ‚4‚  or less, turn to  ‚133‚

	If it is  ‚5‚  or higher, turn to  ‚87‚
