	You concentrate on the wall of the hut, at a point ä	directly opposite the guarded door, and then you ä	summon forth the Old Kingdom power word - ÈGloar!È. The ä	concussion of your spell-word hits the wall and 
	punches a ragged hole through its bamboo timbers. You ä	run at this hole and barge the weakened wall with ä	your shoulder. It cracks and splits open, enabling ä	you to force yourself through the gap and escape.
