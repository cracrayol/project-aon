	You dismount from your mule and hurry into the ä	village. The fiercest fire is raging through the roof ä	of the largest hut which dominates the centre of the ä	settlement, and it is here that you concentrate your ä	efforts. Using your Magnakai discipline of Nexus, you ä	are able to limit the spread of the flames and allow
	the villagers time to collect water with which they ä	put out the blaze. Your Kai skill protects you from ä	the scorching heat of the fire, but your backpack is ä	damaged and you lose two pieces of equipment. (Erase ä	any two backpack items from your ÈAction ChartÈ)

	When all of the smaller fires in the surrounding huts ä	have also been extinguished, the elder of the village ä	thanks you for your timely help. He tells you that ä	the fire was started deliberately by a dragon that ä	dwells in the Hulhuk Mountains. 
	
	"It is the bane of our humble village," he says, ä	shaking his head sadly, "and we fear that it will ä	return this night to finish us." Seeing the Kai ä	weapon sheathed at your side, the elder looks at you ä	with renewed hope in his eyes. He begs you to stay ä	here tonight and help rid the village of its bane.
