	Your heart misses a beat the instant you recognise ä	the face of this unhappy young woman. It is Oriah, ä	the highborn daughter of the Funtal of Fio Fadali, ä	the runaway who travelled with you aboard ÈThe Pride ä	of SommerlundÈ on its ill-fated voyage out of ä	Barrakeesh. Ever since she was abducted in the ä	mountain town of Kilij you thought it unlikely that ä	you would ever see her again. Yet here she sits, ä	alone and dejected in a hall that is overflowing with ä	an abundance of riches.

	"Oriah ?" you whisper hesitantly, hardly daring to ä	believe that it is really her. She raises her head ä	and her eyes widen with shocked surprise when she ä	sees you. Then a smile, filled with hope and joy, ä	lights up her tear-streaked face. She leaps from her ä	chair and comes running to you to throw herself into ä	your arms.

	"Oh Grand Master," she sobs, "I never thought that 
	I'd see you again. How did you know that I was 
	here ?"

	You tell Oriah of what has happened since you arrived ä	in Ghol-Tabras, and that you had no idea that she was ä	here at all. She explains that after she was abducted ä	by slavers in Kilij, she was sold to Sesketera who ä	brought her here to his citadel. She is to be kept ä	imprisoned in this hall until their wedding day, one ä	month from now. 

	"Let us escape from this place together," you say, ä	but she shakes her head. "No, it cannot be. Sesketera ä	is holding my friends. They are his hostages. If I ä	leave the citadel before our wedding day he will put ä	them to the sword. I cannot leave. But I know how I ä	may help you to escape. Come, Grand Master, follow ä	me."
