	You enter the crowded emporium and marvel at the ä	sheer variety of goods that are for sale. Lencian ä	silverware, spices from Mhytan, animal hides from the ä	southern Karnali to name but a few. There is even ä	pottery and ironware from your homeland, all stacked ä	side by side upon the shelves and counters that fill ä	this busy store.

	You make your way to a counter and ask a moon-faced ä	youth in a leather apron if he knows the whereabouts ä	of Radyard, the master of the ÈSeaspriteÈ. He has never ä	heard of the Captain, but he is eager to help and he ä	does not want to lose your custom. He invites you to ä	look around the emporium while he goes and asks his ä	employer.

	You browse along the shelves and although you find ä	many of the items fascinating, there are only six
	that you would consider purchasing: a hammer, a coil ä	of rope, a silver-backed mirror, a blanket, a steel ä	flask and a pewter goblet.
	
	The youth returns shortly and you see him shaking his ä	head. He is unable to help you find Radyard and his ä	crew.


	If you wish to enquire about the prices of the items ä	you have noticed, turn to  ‚57‚

	If you do not wish to purchase anything here, turn to  ä	‚278‚

	The youth takes a list from his apron pocket and ä	reels off the prices of the items as you point to ä	them on the shelves:

	"Hammer...1 Nobel
	 Rope...2 Nobels
	 Silver Mirror...2 Nobels
	 Blanket...1 Nobel
	 Steel Flask...1 Nobel
	 Pewter Goblet...1 Nobel"
	
	All items must be paid for in Nobels (Gold Crowns are ä	not accepted here). If you wish to purchase any of ä	the above, do so and adjust your ÈAction ChartÈ ä	accordingly. 

	The youth thanks you for your custom and as you turn ä	to leave he suggests that you ask after Captain ä	Radyad at the Warehouse. You thank him and you take ä	his advice.
