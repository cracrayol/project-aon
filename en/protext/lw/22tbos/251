	You focus your powers at some loose rocks that Š	overhang the crevice, and you see them shudder under Š	the force of your will. Suddenly they collapse and Š	come crashing down, severing the rope as they tumble Š	past the crevice to disappear into the gorge below.

	As the floor of the bridge ceases to sway, you Š	quickly remount your horse and coax him across to the Š	far side. You can hear angry voices echoing from the Š	gorge as you spur him to the gallop and escape along Š	the jungle trail that continues beyond the bridge.
