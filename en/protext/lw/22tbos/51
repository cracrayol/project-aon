	As you draw closer to the sound, you detect that it Š	is a strange vocal chant, a low ululation that sends Š	shivers coursing down your back. You feel that you Š	are very close to the source when suddenly, through Š	the trees ahead, you see a clearing where a large Š	crowd of tribal natives are gathered.  
	
	From the cover of the bordering undergrowth you watch  
	a crow-faced man in tattered black robes standing at Š	the centre of this crowd. He is uttering the chilling Š	chant. Before him, on a stone altar, there lies the Š	decaying remains of a body encased in rotting Š	swathings. Your Kai senses reveal to you that the 
	robed man is a Kitaezi Shaman, an evil necromancer Š	who has enslaved these natives with his power. You Š	sense also that it is the same power that was used to Š	create the creature that attacked and slayed your Š	horse last night.

	Suddenly the terrible sound of the chant ceases and Š	the Shaman shrieks with rage. He points to where you Š	are hiding and your heart sinks. He has detected your Š	presence. He pounds the altar with his fist and to Š	your horror, you see the decaying remains begin to Š	shift and stir into life. The Shaman intones a dark Š	spell and the grisly corpse leaves the altar and Š	comes stalking towards you, its fleshless arms Š	outstretched. Waves of psychic energy buffet your Š	mind. They paralyse you and keep you from escaping. Š	You summon your psychic Kai defences and break this Š	powerful spell, yet it is now too late to turn and Š	run from the Shaman's horror - it is almost upon you. Š	Instinctively you reach to your satchel for you sense Š	that the Moonstone is all that can save you from this Š	creature's ghastly embrace. You pull open the flap to Š	reveal the magical stone and the effect is Š	devastating.
