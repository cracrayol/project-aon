	The villagers fire their bows and every arrow strikes Š	the dragon, yet none of them penetrate the creature's Š	scaly hide. You hold your fire until you have a clear Š	shot at the creature's eye, which appears to be the Š	only part of its body that is vulnerable to a Š	missile. Your shaft comes close to its mark: it Š	glances off the dragon's eyelid. The creature seems Š	not to even notice your hit. It circles the village Š	once more and then hovers above the burnt-out remains Š	of the central hut. You watch the creature and your Š	Kai sixth sense tells you that it has not come here Š	bent on destruction. It is seeking something in the Š	charred ruins.
