	The walls of the armoury are lined with oaken racks ä	containing many skillfully crafted weapons. They are ä	all of ancient design and many centuries old. Their ä	gleaming blades have been kept in pristine condition, ä	yet it strikes you that this chamber is more like a ä	museum than an armoury. Clearly the Elder Magi have ä	little need for conventional weapons.
	
	Among the racks you note the following weapons that ä	are of exceptional quality:

	             Spear        Short Sword 
	             Mace         Warhammer   
	             Bow          Broadsword  
	
	If you wish to take any of these weapons, make the ä	appropriate adjustment to your ÈAction ChartÈ. (The ä	maximum number of normal weapons that you can carry ä	is two.)
