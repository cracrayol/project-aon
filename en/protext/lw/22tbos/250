	Slowly the door opens to reveal a grey-haired man Š	clad in the robes of a High Counsel elder of Dessi. Š	At first his sea-blue eyes and lordly countenance are Š	fixed in sudden mood, but then he recognises the Š	insignia of your Kai tunic and his stern face breaks Š	into a warm and welcoming smile.

	"Praise the Gods!  You have arrived, Grand Master. 
	I feared that you and your precious cargo had been Š	lost at Ghol-Tabras. I am Zinair. Please, please, Š	come inside"

	Lord Zinair ushers you into the consulate and asks Š	you to wait in his private chambers. After he has Š	taken the precaution of dismissing his staff, he Š	joins you there. He had expected your arrival weeks Š	ago and had almost abandoned hope that he would ever Š	see you alive, fearing that you had fallen foul of Š	Sesketera. When you recount all the perils of your Š	journey from Elzian, Zinair is doubly amazed that you Š	are with him now. You reassure him that you still Š	have the Moonstone and you offer to show him the Š	precious artifact, but he declines your offer saying Š	that it would be safer for you both if it were to Š	remain within its korlinium satchel. 
	
	Zinair suggests that you bathe and eat and avail Š	yourself of the many luxuries that the consulate has Š	to offer. He suggests that after you are rested you Š	meet again later so that you may discuss the final Š	and most-vital part of your mission.
