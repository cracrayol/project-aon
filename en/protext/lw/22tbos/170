	The secret passage is festooned with cobwebs and Š	shows little sign of having been used for many Š	decades. It twists and turns for several hundred Š	yards before ending at a blank wall of moldering Š	plaster. Closer inspection reveals another panel, one Š	that is controlled by a lever set into the web-strewn Š	ceiling.
	
	You pull this lever and the panel squeaks open to Š	reveal a sumptuous chamber hung with rich and Š	colourful tapestries. Incense smoulders in silver Š	bowls and the perfumed air is filled with the Š	chirping sounds of exotic caged birds. 

	Cautiously you enter this luxurious room and see that Š	it is one of several antechambers which adjoin a Š	larger hall. Seated upon a padded chair in the middle Š	of this hall is a young dark-haired woman who is Š	dressed in flowing white silks. Her head is bowed and Š	she appears to be upset. She is sobbing quietly.
