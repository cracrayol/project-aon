	During the journey to Tiklu you learn much from Tzai Š	- your talkative companion. He tells you tales about Š	the local history of this region, its ancient legends Š	and heroes, and about the dark days not so long ago Š	when it was ruled by Shasarak, the infamous Wytch-Š	king of Shadaki.

	The journey passes swiftly in his good company and Š	you arrive at Tiklu during the afternoon. It is a Š	bustling port which stands at the edge of the Sea of Š	Winds, and is second only in size and importance to Š	the City of Shadaki itself. Tzai is welcomed by the Š	guards on watch at the gate who wave as you pass Š	beneath its mighty arch. It is clear from their Š	reaction that your companion is a popular man. As you Š	travel along a paved avenue towards the heart of Š	Tiklu, Tzai asks where you are going to stay during Š	your visit. When you cannot readily answer his Š	question, he invites you to stay at his house Š	tonight. Gratefully you accept his generous Š	invitation.
