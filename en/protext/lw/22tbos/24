	After nearly an hour your efforts are rewarded and Š	you are able to pull open the door to your cell.
	You enter the corridor beyond and make your way Š	silently towards the guardroom. You are determined to Š	retrieve your Kai weapon and equipment, but you are Š	also aware that you must avoid alerting the guards if Š	you are to preserve your hopes of escaping from this Š	gaol alive.

	Peering around the door to the guardroom you discover Š	that it is occupied by three gaolers. They are Š	playing cards, and they are using the crate which Š	contains your equipment as a makeshift table. In Š	order to get at your equipment you must first lure Š	the gaolers out of the room.
