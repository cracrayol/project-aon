	The officer is outraged by your offer. He summons his Š	guards and he has you dragged away to the cells. All Š	of your equipment is confiscated, including your Š	satchel.
	
	Fearing for your life and the safety of the Š	Moonstone, later in the day you escape from your cell Š	and go in search of your missing equipment. Your make Š	it as far as the Hall of Correction's inner keep Š	before the alarm is sounded and you are entrapped Š	there. You offer to surrender but the officer refuses Š	to listen. He orders his guards to encircle the Š	battlements and then, without mercy, he orders them Š	to open fire at you with their crossbows. 

	Tragically, your life and your quest end here in the Š	Hall of Correction.
