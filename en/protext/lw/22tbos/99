	At first the old man is reluctant to lower his price, ä	but when you shake your head and step towards the ä	door as if to leave, he changes his mind and agrees ä	to sell the doll for 7 Gold Crowns. You nod in ä	agreement and carefully the old man wraps the doll in ä	a square of linen while you count out 10 Gold Crowns ä	from your belt pouch. With trembling hands he takes ä	the coins and gives you the package which you place ä	into your backpack.
	
	Record the Nhang Doll on your ÈAction ChartÈ as a ä	Special Item, and remember to erase 7 Gold Crowns ä	from your current total.
