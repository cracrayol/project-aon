	You find your way to the docks and discover Captain ä	Leonghi's ship moored at the end of the quay. It is ä	battered old trader that is in desperate need of a ä	lick of paint, but it looks seaworthy enough. The
	crewman on watch is expecting you and he invites you ä	aboard. The Captain greets you with a wry smile. He ä	has heard stories about the incident at the Caeno ä	Derby yesterday and he insists that you remain in ä	your cabin until the ÈEmbassageÈ is safely out at sea.
	You agree to his request and descend the prow deck ä	ladder to your cabin below.

	Unless you possess the discipline of Grand ä	Huntmastery, you must now eat a Meal or lose 3 ä	ENDURANCE points.
