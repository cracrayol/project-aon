	You take a handful of coins from your belt pouch and Š	offer them to Radyard as payment for your passage to Š	Masama, but the jovial Captain declines to accept Š	them. There is plenty of room on his ship and he is Š	happy to allow you to stay aboard for free. He Š	refills your glass with ale and then he proposes a Š	toast. It is one that you readily applaud: 
	
	"To the long and continuing friendship of our peoples Š	- to Sommerlund and Siyen!"
