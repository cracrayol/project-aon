	"Perhaps you can tell me what you make of this, ä	Captain," you say, as you retrieve the Siyen Crown ä	from your backpack. "It was found some weeks ago in a ä	wreck off the coast of Vassagonia."
	
	Radyard take the silver crown and he inspects it ä	carefully. He smiles when he discovers a Siyenese ä	inscription engraved along its inner rim.

	"It's the crown of a princess," he says, "not a state ä	crown, mark you, but one that she would have worn ä	while carrying out her daily duties. The inscription ä	shows that it comes from royal household of Oridon. ä	It's more than a century old and I'd say it's likely ä	that it belonged to Princess Fahra. She was lost at ä	sea. It's not worth a great fortune but it would have ä	some historical value, especially in my homeland."

	"In that case, Captain," you say, "you are welcome to ä	keep it...in return for my passage to Masama."

	Radyard readily agrees (erase this Special Item from ä	your ÈAction ChartÈ) and he refills your glass with ale ä	and proposes a toast: 
	
	"To the long and prosperous friendship of our ä	countries - to Sommerlund and Siyen!"
