	Your Grand Mastery of Elementalism tells you that ä	this is no ordinary storm - it is the result of ä	powerful elemental sorcery. You urge Gemulkin to turn ä	his ship about for the fury of this unnatural storm ä	is churning the sea, making it boil and seethe. ä	Fearing for the safety of his cargo and crew the ä	Captain readily agrees and he orders his helmsman to ä	bring the ship around. But as the ÈVargasÈ returns ä	towards Shuri Point, Gemulkin suddenly sees something ä	on the horizon that makes him change his mind.
