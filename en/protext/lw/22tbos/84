	The Captain complies with your powerful psychic ä	suggestions and, without really knowing why, he ä	orders his helmsman to steer towards the distant ä	speck in the sea. As you draw closer, you see that ä	the man is lying unconscious upon a raft made of ä	coiled ropes and smashed timbers. A crewman brings ä	him aboard and together you carry him to your cabin ä	where you wrap him in a blanket and use your Kai ä	healing skills to bring him back to consciousness.
	
	As slowly the man recovers his senses, you learn that ä	his name is Gregor Luggs. He is a Lourdanian sailor
	and sole survivor of a pirate attack which destroyed ä	his ship and killed all of his fellow crewmen three ä	days ago. 

	"It was the Shadakine who done it," he says, ä	trembling with anger. "They came upon us at night. ä	Out o'the dark with not a deck light showin'. After ä	they'd took all o'the cargo, they turned their ä	cannons on us. We didn't stand a chance."
	
	Gregor thanks you repeatedly for saving his life. ä	Another few hours and he would have died of exposure. 
	As a mark of his gratitude he gives you an ornate ä	Silver Clasp (record this on your ÈAction ChartÈ as a ä	Special Item which you keep in your tunic pocket) and
	he insists that he pay you for allowing him to share ä	your cabin and food. He takes 10 Gold Crowns from his ä	belt pouch and offers them to you (if you decide to ä	accept them, remember to adjust your ÈAction ChartÈ ä	accordingly).
