	On returning to Grooja's hut, you find Tolshi waiting ä	ther for you. He asks you to accompany him to the ä	ship at once for the Captain needs you to help with ä	the repairs. It is as if your silent prayers for ä	rescue have been answered. You thank the elder for ä	the visit to the oracle, and his wife for her ä	hospitality, and then you leave quickly with the ä	helmsman.
	
	"The Captain dosn't really need your help," confides ä	a grinning Tolshi, as you make your way hurriedly ä	through the hovels of Dlash-da Ralzuha towards its ä	torchlit harbour. "He just thought you'd welcome an ä	excuse for not having to stay all night at Grooja's ä	flea-ridden shack!"

	On your return to the ship you thank the Captain for ä	sending Tolshi to rescue you, and to show your ä	appreciation, you help the crew to patch the damaged ä	hull. By first light the repairs have been completed ä	and the cargo is then reloaded into the hold. Jenkshi ä	gives Grooja and the natives some copper ingots as ä	payment for their help, then the crew cast off and ä	catch the morning tide. 
	
	For two days ÈThe AzanÈ hugs the coastline as is sails ä	a southerly course to Ghol-Tabras. The weather is ä	kind and the ship makes good progress, enabling you ä	to enter port shortly before dusk.
