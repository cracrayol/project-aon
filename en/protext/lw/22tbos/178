	Tolshi arrives unexpectedly at Grooja's hut. He asks ä	you to return to the ship at once for the Captain ä	needs you to help with the repairs. It is as if your ä	silent prayers for rescue have been answered. You ä	thank the elder and his wife for their hospitality, ä	and then you leave quickly with the helmsman.
	
	"The Captain dosn't really need your help," says a ä	grinning Tolshi, as you make your way hurriedly ä	through the hovels of Dlash-da Ralzuha towards its ä	torchlit harbour, "He just thought you'd welcome an ä	excuse for not having to stay all night at Grooja's ä	flea-ridden shack!"

	On your return to the ship you thank the Captain for ä	sending Tolshi to rescue you, and to show your ä	appreciation, you help him and the crew to patch the ä	damaged hull. By first light the repairs have been ä	completed and the cargo is reloaded into the hold. ä	Jenkshi gives Grooja and the natives some copper ä	ingots as payment for their help, then the crew weigh ä	anchor and prepare to catch the morning tide. 
	
	For two days ÈThe AzanÈ hugs the coastline as is sails ä	a southerly course to Ghol-Tabras. The weather is ä	kind and the ship makes good progress, enabling you ä	to enter port shortly before dusk.
