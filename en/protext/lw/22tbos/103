	Your polite request is met by a torrent of shouts and Š	coarse laughter from the drunken Eldenorans. Yet the Š	Captain does as you ask; he releases his grip and Š	lets the gasping crewman drop in a heap to the Š	taproom floor. You motion to the others that it is Š	time to leave. Without a word they leave their tables Š	and move towards the door, pausing only to pick up Š	their injured comrade as they go. With the threats Š	and crude curses of the Eldenorans ringing in your Š	ears, you walk away from the Three Capstans Inn and Š	return to the harbour. The crew feel angry and Š	frustrated by what has happened, yet they know that Š	your cool-headed intervention has saved them from far Š	worse treatment at the hands of the brutish Š	Eldenorans, and for that they are grateful.
