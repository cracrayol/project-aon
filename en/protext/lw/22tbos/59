	You stagger to your feet and climb the spiral steps Š	until you come to a landing where several corridors Š	converge. Some of these corridors are occupied by Š	gaolers and other officials of Sesketera's citadel Š	who are going about their duties. Then you hear the Š	sound of footsteps ascending the stairs behind you, Š	and this sound reminds you of the pressing need to Š	keep moving. You draw upon your Magnakai disciplines Š	of Huntmastery and Pathsmanship to help you choose Š	the best route of escape and, to your surprise, in Š	doing so you discover a secret panel in the wall at Š	the head of the stairwell. You reach out and press a Š	raised stud and the concealed panel slides open to Š	reveal a narrow passageway beyond. Quickly you enter Š	this passage before your pursuers appear, and the Š	panel automatically clicks shut behind you.
