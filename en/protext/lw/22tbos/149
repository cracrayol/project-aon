	As you deal the creature the killing blow, its body Š	crackles and disintegrates into a million motes of Š	light that dissolve into the darkness like a swarm of Š	fleeing fireflies. You rush to aid your horse who is Š	lying motionless among the boulders, but sadly you Š	discover that it is already too late to save him. 
	
	Fear and uncertainty haunts you as patiently you Š	await the dawn. The being that attacked and slayed Š	your mount was not of this world; it was a creature Š	born wholly of evil magic. With a gnawing sense of Š	dread, you leave at first light and follow the jungle
	trail to the west. The forest and vegetation are Š	teeming with life, yet as you go deeper into the Š	jungle so the sounds become fewer and more distant. Š	By midday you have covered twenty miles and arrived Š	at a place where are no sounds at all. The eerie Š	silence surrounds you for several miles further until 
	your Kai hunting skills detect a faint noise. It Š	drifts towards you from among the towering trees to Š	the right of the jungle path. Cautiously you leave Š	the trail and make your way towards the source of Š	this solitary sound.
