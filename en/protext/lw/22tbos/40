	You swallow a mouthful of the food and, to your ä	surprise, it tastes remarkably good. Yet after a few ä	moments later you suddenly sense that something is ä	seriously wrong. You begin to feel faint and light-ä	headed, and you are having difficulty focusing ä	clearly. 
	
	Automatically your Magnakai discipline of Nexus works ä	to counteract the powerful narcotic that has been ä	added to the food. It induces you to vomit (lose 2 ä	ENDURANCE points), and then it swiftly neutralizes ä	the remaining toxins from your blood. The bald man ä	realises from your reaction to his drugged food that ä	you are a follower of the God Kai. He shrieks with ä	rage and curses you in a vile language that you do ä	not recognise. Even so, the mere sound of his curses ä	sends a shiver of dread coursing down your spine, ä	like a trickle of icy cold water. He denounces you to ä	the others as an agent of the City Council sent to ä	spy on their meeting, and he orders them to attack ä	and slay you. The men react slowly to his frantic ä	commands. It is as if they are struggling to awaken ä	from a deep sleep. You have no wish to fight these ä	men and so you turn and run towards the park entrance ä	to escape from them. As you reach the open gate, you ä	glance over your shoulder to see that the bald man is ä	preparing to hurl a dagger at your back.
