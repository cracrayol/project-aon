	Lord Rimoah bids you goodnight and reminds you that Š	he shall call for you at an hour before dawn. You Š	retire to bed and stare at the ceiling as you think Š	about the quest that lies ahead. No sooner have you Š	fallen asleep, or so it seems, than you are awoken by Š	Rimoah's knock on the door. You gather your weapons Š	and belongings and then walk with him through a Š	procession of torchlit corridors that lead to the Š	entrance to the tower. As you approach the main Š	doors, Rimoah indicates a chamber off to your right.

	"That is the Tower Armoury, Grand Master," he says. Š	"You are welcome to inspect it and take whatever you Š	wish before you embark upon your voyage."
	
	
	If you wish to accept Rimoah's offer, you may enter Š	the armoury and examine its contents by turning 
	to  â152â 

	If you decide to decline his offer, turn to  â49â
