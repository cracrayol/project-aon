	Your Kai camouflage skills keep you hidden despite ä	the glare of the gaolers' torches. As soon as they ä	have passed by, you slip inside the guardroom and ä	retrieve your confiscated equipment (you may now ä	erase the asterisks from your ÈAction ChartÈ). 
	
	As you are sheathing your Kai weapon into your belt, ä	you hear the guards returning along the corridor. ä	Looking around you see that there is one other exit ä	from this room - a heavy oak door which is banded ä	with strips of black iron.


	If you possess an Iron Key, turn to  ‚125‚
