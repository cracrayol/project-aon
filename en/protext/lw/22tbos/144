	The crew are in good spirits by the time you arrive Š	at the Three Capstans Inn. The owner, a pot-bellied Š	man with an oddly childlike face, welcomes the Š	Suhnese with open arms and he orders his son to be Š	generous with the ale. The tavern has three taprooms Š	which are all busy, but not overcrowded, and in each Š	area there is a minstrel and a juggler to entertain Š	the patrons. During the course of the evening you Š	learn that these raucous jongleurs are all members of Š	the owner's family.
	
	The entertainments continue for most of the evening Š	until the joyful mood is unexpectedly soured by the Š	arrival of an Eldenoran crew, led by their boarish Š	Captain. These coarse, loud-mouthed thugs seem to Š	delight in hurling cheap insults at the Suhnese. Š	Stocially the crew ignore the abuse, quietly hoping Š	that the Eldenorans will soon tire of goading them Š	and leave, but then one of Jenkshi's men rails Š	against a racial slur and in a moment of anger he Š	yells at them to shut their foul mouths. For a few Š	moments the tavern is filled with a deathly hush, Š	then the Eldenoran Captain lunges at him, grabs him Š	by the neck, and lifts him one-handedly off his feet. 

	"I've a better idea, y'bilge rat. Why don't I shut Š	your mouth up instead, eh?" he growls, as slowly he Š	tightens his vice-like grip on the helpless crewman's Š	throat.
	

	If you wish to make the Eldenoran release his grip, Š	turn to  â173â
	
	If you choose instead to apologise to the Captain and Š	ask him politely to release the crewman, turn to  â103â
