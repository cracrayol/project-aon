	You run through an open bulkhead door into an Š	adjacent cargo area that is stacked with crates of Š	food and barrels of water. On the far side of this Š	hold you see a wooden ladder that ascends to a hatch Š	in the foredeck. Your Kai senses detect that there is Š	also a concealed trapdoor in the floor of the hold, Š	close to the base of the ladder.
	
	Suddenly you hear the cracking of timbers and you Š	sense that the creature has freed its claws from the Š	wall of the cargo hold behind you. You hear the Š	snake-like hiss of its breath and you know that you Š	have but a few seconds before it will come rushing Š	through open bulkhead door.
	

	If you wish to hide among the crates and barrels, Š	turn to  â254â

	If you wish to climb the ladder to the foredeck Š	hatch, turn to  â31â

	If you wish to open the concealed trapdoor in the Š	floor, turn to  â112â
