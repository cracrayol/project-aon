	At length the avenue arrives at a busy market square.
	On entering, you are assailed from all sides by Š	merchants eager to sell their wares. All manner of Š	goods are offered but most are of little or no use to Š	you. As you push your way through the merchants, you Š	notice a market stall that sells healing concoctions. Š	One of these is Laumspur for which the vendor is Š	asking 2 Nobels per potion. (Each potion of Laumspur Š	restores 4 ENDURANCE points when consumed after Š	combat.)
	

	If you wish to ask the vendor if he knows the Š	whereabouts of Lord Zinair, turn to  â238â

	If you choose to leave the stall and cross over to Š	the far side of the square, turn to  â53â
