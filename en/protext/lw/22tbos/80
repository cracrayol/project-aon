	The moment you voice the answer to the challenge, the Š	black globes disappear and the mist fades to reveal a Š	lush, green, volcanic island that is crowned by a Š	halo of silvery cloud. Your pulse races with Š	anticipation as you feel the sea return beneath the Š	keel of your craft, and a wind to propel you towards Š	this wondrous isle. You have met the challenge and Š	you have triumphed. Now you shall reap your reward by Š	landing upon the shores of Lorn - mystical realm of Š	the exiled Shianti.
