	You suddenly recall that it is the custom of the Š	guildsmen of Shadaki to offer a glass of liqueur to Š	their prospective business clients. To refuse this Š	offer is considered a grave insult. You do not wish Š	to upset the guildsman, yet also you do not wish to Š	leave the Suhnese waiting too long for you in the Š	street outside the hall. There is a curfew in force Š	and night is fast approaching.

		
	If you choose to accept the guildsman's glass of Š	liqueur, turn to  â271â
	
	If you choose to decline his offer and make an excuse Š	in order to leave, turn to  â95â
