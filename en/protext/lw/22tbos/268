	Once everyone is safely back aboard ÈThe AzanÈ, you ä	inform Captain Jenkshi of what happened at the Three ä	Capstans Inn. With a resigned expression on his ä	weather-beaten face, he listens to your report and ä	then thanks you for the part you played in saving his ä	crew from further injury or death. He tells you that ä	similar incidents have happened many times before, in ä	ports all over Magnamund, and he is resigned to the ä	fact that they will happen again sometime in the ä	future. Eldenorians are imfamous for their bigotry ä	and intollerence; Jenkshi is just glad that this time ä	his crew had the good fortune to have you looking ä	after their interests.
	
	Before you and the crew retire to your cabins to ä	sleep, the Captain takes the precaution of posting ä	extra watchmen on deck, just in case the Eldenorans ä	should come looking for trouble during the night.
