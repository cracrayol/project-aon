	Three miles from the village you discover a jungle ä	trail. You keep to this trail and stay on the move ä	all night, foregoing rest in order to distance ä	yourself from the hostile natives. Shortly before ä	dawn, you crest a wooded ridge and see the port of ä	Masama in the distance. It lies astride a wide river ä	that is dotted with many trading ships and fishing ä	boats.
	
	As you approach the port, your muddy and dishevelled ä	appearance attracts jibes from the children of ä	Masama. Stung by their rude remarks, you decide that ä	you are in desperate need of a bath and so you go ä	down to the river bank to wash away the worst of the ä	grime. While you are here you notice that the two ä	halves of the town are connected by a series of ä	wooden bridges. The opposite side of the river is ä	home to the business district. Here are wharfs and ä	warehouses and a quay that is filled to overflowing ä	with trading ships and barges. The ÈSeaspriteÈ was ä	bound for this port, and although you cannot see her ä	moored among the scores of ships at the quay, you ä	decide to go there and check if Radyard and his crew ä	are still in port.

	You cross the river by bridge and enter a market ä	square bordered by warehouses, taverns, and busy ä	trade emporiums that are crowded with foreign crews. ä	As your keen eye wanders around this bustling scene, ä	you try to decide where first to look for Radyard and ä	his men.
