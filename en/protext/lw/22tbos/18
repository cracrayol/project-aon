	You apologise to your companions and ask them to wait Š	for you outside the hall's double doors. Meekly the Š	Suhnese agree, and as they file out of the hall you Š	assure them that they will not have to wait too long. Š	You then accompany the guildsman to his chambers Š	where he attempts to drive a hard bargain for the Š	copper. He offers you 6 Nobels for each ingot and Š	says that it is his best and final price. It is not a Š	very good price and you tell him that you will have Š	to speak with Jenkshi before you can agree to his Š	offer. 

	"Very well," he says. "I'm sure your captain is a Š	reasonable man. I feel confident we'll do business."

	From an ornate cabinet he removes a decanter and two Š	long-stemmed glasses. He then pours two glasses of Š	liqueur and offers one of them to you.
