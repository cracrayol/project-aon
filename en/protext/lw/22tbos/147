	Gemulkin orders the crew to hoist the sails and ä	secure the decks before the ÈVargasÈ plunges into the ä	heart of the raging storm. You brace yourself for the ä	rough passage, yet you are stunned by the sheer ä	breathtaking violence of the storm. It pounds the ä	decks and lifts the hull clear from the water. As the ä	ship lurches wildly, you are thrown across the aft ä	deck to crash painfully against a splintered hatch ä	cover: lose 6 ENDURANCE points.

	Through the blinding spray, you see the helmsman lose ä	his footing and fall overboard. His cry alerts ä	Gemulkin who battles his way bravely to the ship's ä	wheel. To prevent himself from being swept overboard, ä	he fixes his belt to the hub of the wheel and then he ä	fights to turn his ship into a towering wave, to save ä	her from capsizing. A mighty wave crashes against the ä	prow and Gemukin's courageous action saves the ÈVargasÈ ä	from being split it two. It rides the wave and ä	emerges from the storm into calmer waters beyond. You ä	thank Ishir that you have survived this ordeal, yet ä	it soon becomes apparent that the storm is merely the ä	prelude to an even greater threat to the ship's ä	survival.
