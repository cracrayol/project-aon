	You hurry with Lord Rimoah through the corridors of Š	the Tower of Truth towards the sound of the tolling Š	bell, until at last you arrive at a chamber located Š	below its vaulted presidium. Gathered here are the Š	members of the High Council. They stand in a circle Š	around the cloaked body of Lord Casis which lies upon Š	a bed of shimmering crystals. A cocoon of light Š	encases his frail form, its pale luminescence Š	shedding an uncanny glow upon the faces of the Š	surrounding elders. Rimoah joins them, and as you Š	observe this eerie scene, you recall Lone Wolf's Š	teachings at the Kai Monastery. 
	
	The Elder Magi are all that remain of the race of Š	beings from whom all goodly magic stems. They were Š	sent to Magnamund almost ten thousand years ago by Š	the Gods Kai and Ishir to defeat Agarash the Damned, Š	Naar's first champion, and they triumphed in their Š	task. Yet, in a later age their numbers were Š	decimated by a plague and the few thousands who Š	survived this tragedy sought refuge here in Dessi. Š	The Elder Magi have always aided Sommerlund and have Š	been loyal and invaluable allies to the Kai. But now Š	their ancient power is waning, and the few thousands Š	who survived the Great Plague now number less than Š	one hundred.
	
	Suddenly the bell ceases to toll and you watch in awe Š	as the fragile remains of Lord Casis gradually fade Š	from sight. He has ended his time here upon Magnamund Š	and has passed over into the Plane of Light, the Š	ethereal domain of the Gods Kai and Ishir. Silently Š	the remaining elders file out of the chamber. As Lord Š	Rimoah passes, he beckons you to follow him. 

	"You are the first Kai who has ever witnessed the Š	ascension of an Elder," he says, as he takes you back Š	to your room. "Alas, our power ebbs with each passing Š	year for this is the twilight of our existence here Š	on Magnamund. Yet, we embrace our fate, for even as Š	we weaken and fade so the power of the New Order Kai Š	grows stronger. This is the dawning of your Age, Š	Grand Master. You and your brothers shall carry Š	forward the fight against Naar, and you shall be Š	victorious."

	Upon reaching your room, Lord Rimoah bids you Š	goodnight and reminds you that he shall call for you Š	an hour before dawn. You retire to bed but remain Š	awake for more than an hour as you contemplate the Š	quest that lies ahead. You are apprehensive of the Š	dangers you may encounter, but you are also greatly Š	inspired by what you have witnessed this night and by Š	Rimoah's prophetic words of wisdom.

	No sooner have you fallen asleep it seems, than you Š	are awoken by Rimoah's knock on the door. You gather Š	your weapons and belongings and walk with him through Š	a procession of torchlit corridors that lead to the Š	entrance to the Tower. As you approach the main Š	doors, Rimoah points to a chamber closeby.

	"That is the Tower Armoury, Grand Master," he says, Š	"You are welcome to inspect it and take whatever you Š	wish before you embark upon your voyage."
	
	
	If you wish to accept Rimoah's offer, you may enter Š	the armoury and examine its contents by turning to  Š	â152â
