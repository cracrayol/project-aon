	You awake to the sight of brilliant sunshine pouring ä	through the window of your room. Your head throbs ä	painfully and there is a strange smell in the air ä	that does not come from the communal lavatory next ä	door. You recognise it to be the aroma of Gallowbrush ä	- a powerful soporific potion. The chair that you ä	placed against the door is no longer there. Its ä	absence makes you immediately check your equipment. ä	As you fear, you discover that you have been drugged ä	and robbed during the night. Your belt pouch is empty ä	(erase all Gold Crowns and Nobels from your ÈAction ä	ChartÈ) and you have lost one Special Item (erase one ä	item of your choice, excluding the Moonstone).
		
	You suspect the tavern-keeper to be the thief and you ä	decide to confront him, but when you look out of the ä	window you see that the ferry is getting ready to ä	depart. Quickly you grab your belongings, leap ä	through the open window, and race along the ä	waterfront.
