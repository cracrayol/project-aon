	Sailing towards you across the Sea of Winds come ä	three pirate ships. They are long and low and rakish, ä	with sleek black hulls and armoured decking. Their ä	scarlet sails are filled by a gusting wind and they ä	move through the water with a silent, ominous speed. 	

	Trapped between storm and buccaneers, Gemulkin faces ä	a difficult decision. He can either confront the ä	approaching raiders or brave the dangers of the ä	storm. He chooses the latter, and as the ÈVargasÈ ä	swings back once more towards Shuri Point, the ä	buccaneers hold off and wait expectantly for the ä	storm to lay claim to your vulnerable ship.

	Pick a number from the ÈRandom Number TableÈ.


	If the number you have chosen is  ‚0‚ - ‚4‚, turn 
	to  ‚25‚

	If it is  ‚5‚ - ‚9‚, turn to  ‚147‚
