	You speak the words of the Brotherhood spell - ä	ÈLightning HandÈ - and extend your right arm towards ä	the trailing rope. A crackling arc of energy leaps ä	from your hand to strike this line, severing it ä	cleanly in two. As the floor of the bridge ceases to ä	sway, you quickly remount your horse and coax him ä	across to the far side. You can hear angry voices ä	echoing through the gorge as you spur him to the ä	gallop and escape along the jungle trail that ä	continues beyond the bridge.
