	The two henchmen draw their swords and the people Š	pressed around them begin to panic. As a clear space Š	forms, you see Melchar stoop to pick up a bottle Š	dropped by the crowd. He hurls it at one of Wrok's Š	men and it strikes him squarely on the forehead, Š	leaving him sprawled unconscious on the ground.

	His confederate whirls his shiny blade around his Š	head and attacks you like a charging bull.
