	You are awoken shortly before dawn by Lord Zinair who ä	helps you prepare your weapons and equipment before ä	leaving the consulate. He accompanies you on ä	horseback to the harbour where you go aboard a ä	fishing boat crewed by consulate staff. On setting ä	off from Suhn you head south, as if you are bound for ä	the rich fishing grounds off the Azanam Peninsula. ä	But shortly after Suhn disappears over the horizon, ä	Zinair brings the boat to a stop and you are lowered ä	over the side in a single-sailed wooden dingy. 
	
	Lord Zinair tells you to take the Moonstone from your ä	satchel and you obey his command. You cup the ä	precious stone in both hands and a wind arises to ä	fill your sail and propel you swiftly towards the ä	mists of the Sea of Dreams.
