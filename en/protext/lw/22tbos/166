	Moments after you break the surface and gulp a Š	lungfull of air, the creature surges past you and Š	snags your cloak in its deadly jaws. To the raucous Š	delight of Sesketera's crewmen, you are dragged Š	around the hull of their ship at tremendous speed Š	before finally the creature dives below the surface Š	and pulls you down in its wake. Desperate to escape Š	from its terrible grip, you stab at its back and Š	sides with your Kai weapon.
