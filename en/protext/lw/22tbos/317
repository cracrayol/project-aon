	Your arrow glances off the blade of Sesketera's Š	halberd and gashes his face. It is not a serious Š	wound but it makes him drop his weapon and stagger Š	backwards. He is clutching at his injured cheek with Š	both hands and you can see blood is beginning to Š	trickle freely through his fingers. Then you hear a Š	noise over on the far side of the balcony and moments Š	later three citadel guards come rushing through the Š	open archway.
	
	"Kill him!" shouts Sesketera, and he presses himself Š	flat to the wall so that they are able to get to you. Š	Looking down into the hall you note that the main Š	doors are still unguarded despite the incessant Š	ringing of the alarm bell. Fearing that your only Š	route of escape may soon be sealed off, you shoulder Š	your bow and leap boldly over the parapet.
