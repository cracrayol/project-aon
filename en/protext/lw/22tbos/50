	The moment you strike the killing blow, the ä	creature's body transforms into a hissing mass of ä	fiery green sparks. Rapidly these sparks dissolve ä	leaving no trace, except for a lingering odour of ä	decay. Your Kai senses detect that the creature was a ä	magical creation, an evil summonation sent here to ä	find the Moonstone. You are pondering who could be ä	responsible for the creature's creation and presence ä	here when suddenly your thoughts are forced to turn ä	to more immediate matters. The hull of the ÈVargasÈ is ä	starting to crack under the relentless pounding of ä	the waves. The hold is rapidly filling with water and ä	you must act swiftly to escape from here before it ä	becomes your watery tomb.
