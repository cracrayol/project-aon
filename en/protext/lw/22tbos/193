	As you leap from the parapet of the harbour bridge, ä	you utter the words of the Old Kingdom spell - ÈShieldÈ ä	- to help protect yourself from the arrows that are ä	whistling past on all sides. It is a precaution that ä	undoubtedly saves your life, for one of the arrows ä	shatters against this invisible barrier as it comes 
	speeding towards the side of your head.
