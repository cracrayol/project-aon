	The boat scrapes aground on the stony shore and you ä	take your first few tentative steps upon the soil of ä	this legendary isle. As you ascend the beach, ä	instinct prompts you to unbuckle your satchel and ä	remove the Moonstone which is now aglow and throbbing ä	rhythmically, like the beat of a giant's heart. As ä	you raise it before you, cupped reverently in both ä	hands, the clouds part and you are bathed in a cone ä	of brilliant sunlight. 
	
	Through the blinding glare of the sun's rays you see ä	a procession of robed figures moving down the beach ä	towards you. Tall and proud and enigmatically ä	graceful, they each shine with a unique radiance that ä	reveals the goodly power of their ancient arcane ä	wizardry. Silently these Shianti encircle you and ä	your senses become charged with a new vitality that ä	instantly obliterates the fatigue of your long ä	passage across the Sea of Dreams. (You may restore ä	your ENDURANCE points total to its original score). ä	Then one of the divine beings moves nearer and, when ä	you look into his eyes, you see your own image ä	reflected there in his mirrored pupils.

	'ÈWelcome, Grand Master,È' he says without speaking, ä	his lyrical voice forming the words in your mind. 'ÈWe ä	have prayed for your safe arrival. We praise you for ä	the skill and courage you have shown during your long ä	and difficult voyage to our realm. Come with us, for ä	now you may rest awhile. Your quest is done."È
