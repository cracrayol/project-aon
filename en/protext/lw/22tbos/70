	You utter the words of the Old Kingdom spell - ä	ÈInvisible FistÈ - and project your open palm at the 
	sniper. The force of your spell hits him in the chest ä	and sends him tumbling backwards from his perch to ä	land heavily upon the exposed roots of the tree. You ä	hurry to his body and discover that his neck has ä	snapped. To your disappointment, you also discover ä	his blowpipe and horn are both useless, having been ä	damaged by the fall.
	
	Quickly you hide his body in the undergrowth and then ä	you move deeper into the jungle, guided and drawn by ä	the strange incessant noise.
