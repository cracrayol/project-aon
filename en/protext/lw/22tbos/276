	The villagers fire their bows and every arrow strikes Š	the dragon, yet none of them penetrate the creature's Š	scaly hide nor deflect it from its chosen course.
	The dragon circles the village once more and then Š	hovers above the burnt-out remains of the central Š	hut. You observe the creature and your Kai sixth Š	sense tells you that it has not come here bent on Š	destruction. It is seeking something in the charred Š	ruins.
