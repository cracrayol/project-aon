	As the last gaoler drops his club and falls ä	lifelessly to the grimy floor, you stagger back ä	against the wall and gasp for air. When you have ä	recovered from the exertion of this deadly unarmed ä	combat, you immediately set about dragging the bodies ä	away into the corners of the cell, beyond the field ä	of vision of anyone who should look through the peep ä	hole in the door. 
	
	While you are going about this grisly task, you ä	notice an Iron Key hanging from a gaoler's belt. (If ä	you wish to keep this key, record it on your ÈAction ä	ChartÈ as a backpack item.) You leave the cell and ä	lock the door using the drawbolt, then you hurry ä	along the corridor to the guardroom to retrieve your ä	confiscated equipment (you may now erase the ä	asterisks from your ÈAction ChartÈ). 
	
	As you are sheathing your Kai weapon into your belt, ä	you hear the sound of footsteps descending a flight ä	of stone steps at the far end of the corridor. More ä	gaolers are approaching; they have been drawn to ä	investigate this lower level by the dying cries of ä	their brother guards.
	
	Desperately you scan the walls of the guardroom for ä	some means of escape and suddenly you see that there ä	is one other exit from this room - a heavy oak door ä	which is banded with strips of black iron. You rush ä	to this door and twist its handle to discover it is ä	locked. With the sound of the approaching footsteps ä	growing ever louder in your ears, you take the Iron ä	Key from your pocket and offer up a prayer to Ishir ä	that it will open this door.
