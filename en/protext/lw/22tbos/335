	Using your advanced camouflage skills, you blend Š	perfectly with the dense foliage as you stalk closer Š	and closer to the source of the noise. You have cause Š	to be thankful for your Grand Mastery when your sixth Š	sense detects the outline of a man's body, high in Š	the boughs of a nearby tree. His limbs and torso are Š	painted with forest colours that help keep him Š	hidden, and you hazard a guess that he is a lookout Š	for a jungle tribe. 
	
	You sense that he has failed to detect your presense. Š	Rather than run the risk of being seen, you make a Š	wide detour around his tree before continuing deeper Š	into the jungle.
