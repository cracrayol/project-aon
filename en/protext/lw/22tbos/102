	The dragon lands at his lair in the mountains and Š	folds his wings to allow you to climb down easily Š	from his scaly back. Carefully you place the bronze Š	statuette into his clawed hand and witness a wondrous Š	transformation take place. Slowly the dragon shrinks Š	and its body changes into that of a tall man with a Š	proud and nobel countenance. He introduces himself to Š	you as Cresosa, the leader of the Rivorzha tribe who Š	dwell on the eastern slopes of the Hulhuk mountains. Š	Unlike the villagers, Cresosa's people have resisted Š	Ulonga's evil rule, even though their resistance has Š	forced them out of their coastal villages to seek
	refuge in the mountains. The statuette has broken a Š	curse placed upon Cresosa by Ulonga the Shaman, and Š	now he is able to return to his people and lead them Š	back to their abandoned homes.

	Before you say farewell, Cresosa offers you two Š	potions of Laumspur (each of these backpack items Š	will restore 4 ENDURANCE points when swallowed after Š	combat). He then gives you directions which take you 
	back to the trail, to a place where a bridge crosses Š	a steep-banked river. Your map tells you that this is Š	a tributary of the River Ito, and you decide to stop Š	here to rest until dawn before continuing your trek Š	to Caeno on foot.

	Unless you possess the discipline of Grand Š	Huntmastery, you must now eat a Meal or lose 3 Š	ENDURANCE points.
