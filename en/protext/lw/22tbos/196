	A little way past the fork, the trail passes around a ä	rocky escarpment and ascends through dense jungle to ä	a forested ridge. Beyond the ridge lies a deep gorge, ä	spanned by a sturdy rope bridge. The floor of the ä	bridge is laid with shorn timbers that are wide ä	enough to allow a wagon to pass. You ride onto the ä	bridge and you are half way across when its timber ä	floor begins to sway violently. Quickly you dismount ä	and use your Kai disciplines of animal control to ä	calm your startled horse. There seems to be no reason ä	for the bridge to be pitching back and forth, but ä	when you look over the side you catch sight of a rope ä	that is attached to its underside. This line descends ä	to a crevice in the wall of the gorge and it is being ä	repeatedly pulled taut and then released. From out of ä	the crevice there issues a commanding voice: "ÈThrow ä	your money and possessions into the gorge!È" When you ä	hesitate to obey, the voice says: "ÈDo it now, or ä	you'll never get off the bridge alive!È"
