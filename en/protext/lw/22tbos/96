	You know that it is only a matter of time before the ä	creature finds your hiding place. Rather than wait to ä	be found, you decide to launch a surprise attack. ä	Using your advanced mastery, you create a noise in ä	the opposite corner of the hold, behind a pair of ä	water barrels. The creature immediately pounces on ä	top of the barrels and slashes at the void behind ä	them. You seize this moment to leave your hiding ä	place and attack the creature from behind.
