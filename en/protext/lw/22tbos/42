	You ask a barman standing behind the counter for a Š	plate of food and a tankard of his finest ale. Š	Cheerfully he fulfils your order and you pay him 2 Š	Nobels. While you are enjoying his delicious fare you Š	ask him if knows the whereabouts of Lord Zinair of Š	Dessi.
	
	"Lord Zinair of Dessi? Mmm...he's the ambassador of Š	Dessi, unless I'm mistaken. I think he lives in the Š	North Quarter. You'd be best to ask at the Š	Soothsayers Shop in Market Square. They'd know...they Š	know pretty much everything. They even know things Š	that havn't happened yet!"

	You thank the barman for his advice. When you have Š	finished your meal, you leave the tavern and continue Š	along the avenue. At length you arrive at a busy Š	market square. On the far side of this square you see Š	the Soothsayers Shop. Heeding the barman's advice, Š	you decide to enter and ask for their assistance.
