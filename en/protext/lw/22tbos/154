	The creature tears aside barrels and upends crates ä	until it discovers the place where you are hiding. ä	You draw your weapon and retreat until your back is ä	pressed against the wall of the hold. With chilling ä	slowness it flexes its talons and bares its ghastly ä	teeth. Then, in a blur of movement, it comes lunging ä	towards you with claws outstretched.
