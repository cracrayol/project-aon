	The inside of the taverna is crowded with travellers Š	eating their meals, and serving girls rushing to and Š	fro clutching trays piled high with food and ale. All Š	of the tables are occupied and there are no spare Š	places.

	"We're full up - can't you see that!" bellows a surly Š	waitress. She slams her tray down on a nearby table, Š	startling the meek-faced group of pilgrims who are Š	seated there.

	"If you want food it'll cost you 4 Nobels...and Š	you'll have to eat it outside!"

	The meals here are very expensive, but your rumbling Š	stomach reminds you that you are very hungry and the Š	city of Jazer is still half a day's walk away.
