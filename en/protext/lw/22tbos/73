	You spring forward and take a running leap at the Š	gate. The momentum of your run carries you high Š	enough to grab the crossbar and pull yourself astride Š	it. You offer Melchar your hand and as soon as he Š	grips it firmly you haul him up. As he struggles to Š	pull himself over the top, one of Wrok's men grabs Š	him by the legs. A desperate tug-of-war ensues Š	between you and the henchmen, with the unlucky Š	Melchar in the role of the rope. Suddenly the Š	henchmen release his legs and you and your companion Š	tumble over the gate to land with a thud on the Š	street outside the racetrack. 
	
	You are getting to your feet when you hear the crowd Š	around you are laughing, but it is not until you look Š	at Melchar that you understand why. In the struggle Š	with the henchmen the young journeyman has lost his Š	breeches. Red-faced with embarrassment, Melchar Š	shouts for you to follow him as he pushes his way Š	through the giggling citizens and enters a narrow Š	alleyway between two shops.
