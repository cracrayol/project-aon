	As the last of the thugs exhales his final breath and Š	crashes to the ground, you make a cursory search of Š	their bodies and discover the following items:

	Daggers (6)
	Swords  (2)
	Gold Crowns (3)
	Nobels (6)

	You hurry along the alley and emerge into an open Š	courtyard. Here the women of Masama are selling their Š	wares, spread out upon gaily-decorated market stalls. Š	Unlike the warehouses and emporiums of the quayside, Š	the people who attend this market all appear to be Š	natives of the city. As you pass by one stall you Š	overhear two women talking about a place called Š	Kitaezi. One of them insists that the whole city has Š	been placed under a curse. You are about to turn back Š	and ask them more about this city when suddenly you Š	are approached by a tall woman who is swathed from Š	head to foot in a fine blue robe. Anxiously she asks Š	if you are a healer, and her piercing grey eyes Š	continually dart to the satchel slung over your Š	shoulder. It is as if she knows that you are carrying Š	the Moonstone.

	Your Kai sixth sense tells you that she means you no Š	harm. You sense that she is is greatly troubled, and Š	when you ask what is wrong, she says that her  Š	daughter, Harni, is gravely ill. She pleads with you Š	to come and help her, and although you deny that you Š	are a healer, you feel compelled to answer her Š	desperate plea for help.
