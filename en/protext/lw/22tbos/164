	You apologise to your companions and ask them to wait ä	for you outside the tavern. Meekly they agree, and as ä	they file out of the door you assure them that you ä	will not keep them waiting too long. You then sit ä	opposite the bearded man and soon discover that he is ä	a merchant captain from Lunarlia. He is interested in ä	buying copper but he will only offer you 4 Nobels for ä	an ingot. It is a poor price and you tell him that ä	you will have to speak with Captain Jenkshi before ä	you can agree to his bid. 

	As you rise from your seat he tells you to wait a ä	moment. Copper is not the only thing that he buys.
	He offers to pay you 8 Nobels for any Special Item ä	(excluding the Moonstone which is not for sale) you ä	possess, 2 Nobels for any Weapon, and 1 Nobel for any ä	Backpack item. If you wish to raise some money for ä	yourself by selling items of equipment to this man, ä	do so now and adjust your ÈAction ChartÈ accordingly.

	You bid the merchant goodnight and he acknowledges ä	the pleasantry with a snake-like blink of his eyes. ä	As you go he calls out to remind you that he can be ä	found here in the morning should Jenkshi decide to ä	sell his copper ingots for 4 Nobels each.
