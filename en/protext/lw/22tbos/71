	On entering the shop you are greeted by a tall woman Š	with pale skin and long black hair. She wears plain Š	robes of brown cloth and a miniature crystal ball Š	that dangles from a chain around her neck.

	"Welcome, stranger," she says, "I am Giolaer the Š	Soothsayer. How may I help you ?"

	You ask if she can tell you where you will find Lord Š	Zinair, the Dessian ambassador.

	She looks into the miniature crystal ball for a few Š	moments and then she replies: 
	
	"I have that knowledge, and all it will cost you is 5 Š	Nobels."
	

	If you wish to pay the Soothsayer 5 Nobels (or 5 Gold Š	Crowns), turn to  â283â

	If you do not have enough money, or if you choose not Š	to pay the sum she requests, turn to  â64â
