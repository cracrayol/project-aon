	Captain Jenkshi posts some crew members to guard the Š	gangplank and cargo hold, then he adjourns to the Š	mess room where he shares his evening meal and a Š	bottle of Bautarian brandy with yourself and the Š	remainder of his men. After supper, you enjoy a game Š	of Samor before you retire to your cabin to sleep.
