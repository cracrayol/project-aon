	You give Melchar your blanket to cover his ä	embarrassment and then you follow him through the ä	alleyways of the east quarter which lead all the way ä	back to ÈThe Song of the Silver StarÈ tavern. The 
	young journeyman laughs with sheer relief at having ä	escaped from Wrok's henchmen when finally you enter ä	the sanctuary of the inn's crowded taproom. The ä	innkeeper asks Melchar if his happy mood is due to a ä	win at the derby. He replies that, thanks to your ä	advice, he did not bet. The only thing he lost was ä	his breeches and he proceeds to tell the innkeeper ä	how that came about. The innkeeper frowns:
	
	"Wrok's not a man to cross, y'know" he says, "he's ä	ruthless when it comes to getting even. I think you ä	two had better stay in the attic tonight. Wrok's sure ä	to send his lackeys out a-huntin' for you."

	You heed the innkeeper's warning and spend the night ä	hidden in his attic room. Before dawn breaks you slip ä	out of the tavern by a back door and say farewell to ä	Melchar in the street outside. 

	"Captain Leonghi's ship is moored down at the docks," ä	he says. "It's called ÈEmbassageÈ. I wish you a swift ä	and safe journey to Nhang, Grand Master. I'll always ä	remember our little adventure at the Caeno Derby and ä	I hope we'll meet again one day when you return to ä	Sommerlund."
