	You push open the tavern's creaky door and step into ä	a low-ceilinged room that is poorly lit and ä	furnished. The air is thick with the smell of burning ä	tallow and customers sit hunched and unspeaking over ä	their glasses of warm rice wine. The one-armed  ä	tavern keeper flashes a toothless grin. "Wanna room?" ä	he mutters. You nod and place two coins on the ä	counter and he tosses you a key engraved with the ä	numeral "1".

	Your room is located at the rear of the tavern, next ä	to the communal lavatory. You draw upon your Kai ä	skills to suppress your sense of smell and prop a ä	solitary chair beneath the door handle to keep it ä	shut. Apart from the chair, a bare mattress of straw ä	is the only other item of furniture. It is a warm ä	night and you have no need of a blanket and so you ä	lie on the mattress and use your satchel and backpack ä	for pillows. Soon you have fallen into a deep sleep.
