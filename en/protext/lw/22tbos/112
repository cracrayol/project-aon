	You prise open the trapdoor and discover a secret Š	compartment, built for the smuggling of contraband. Š	The compartment is empty but it is of no use - it is Š	too small a space in which to hide. You glance at the Š	doorway and see the creature rushing towards the Š	hold. You cannot hope to hide from it now. Your sixth Š	sense tells you that it wants the Moonstone and that Š	it will stop at nothing to take it from you.


	If you wish to stand and fight the creature, turn to  Š	â270â

	If you choose to try and evade it by climbing the Š	ladder to the foredeck hatch, turn to  â242â
