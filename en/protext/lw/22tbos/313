	You speak the words of the Brotherhood spell - ÈNetÈ - ä	and point your right hand at the creature's head. A ä	sticky gout of liquid emerges from your fingertips ä	and shoots towards the creature, yet it reacts with ä	incredible swiftness and leaps aside in time to avoid ä	being caught up in the gluey fluid. 
	
	Having evaded your attack it now continues to stalk ä	its chosen target. Gemulkin frees himself from the ä	wheel, but before he can get away, the beast is upon ä	him like a hungry lion. It grabs him by the throat ä	and lifts him off the deck. You race across the ä	slippery decking and unsheathe your Kai weapon to ä	strike the creature in the side. Callously the beast ä	hurls Gemulkin into the sea and then spins around to ä	face you. Your first blow opens a wound across its ä	chest, making it shriek loudly. But it recovers in an ä	instant and it lashes out at you to connect with your ä	shoulder. The force of the blow knocks you sideways ä	and sends you sliding across the slick deck to fall ä	headlong through an open cargo hatch.
