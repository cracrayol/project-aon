	You hear the spear come whistling towards you and Š	instinctively you dive headlong through the doorway Š	to avoid being struck in the back. Your swift Š	reactions save your life but they do not save you Š	from injury. The tip of the spear gouges your back Š	and the force of impact knocks you to the ground: Š	lose 4 ENDURANCE points.
