	You retrace your steps along the winding alleyways of ä	the Old Quarter and make your way back through the ä	crowds to the harbour. Dusk is drawing its grey cloak ä	across the cloudless sky by the time you reach ÈThe ä	AzanÈ, and when you go aboard you discover that the ä	cargo has been fully loaded. 
	
	Captain Jenkshi is pleased with his crew and feels ä	they deserve a reward for all their hard work. Half ä	of his men would like to spend the night ashore at ä	the Three Capstans Inn, one of their favourite ä	taverns. The tavernkeeper delivered some fresh food ä	to the ship during the afternoon, and he promised a ä	free flagon of ale to any crew member who paid him a ä	visit this evening. The Captain gives his permission, ä	but on one condition - all those who wish to go ä	ashore this evening must be back on board before dawn ä	breaks tomorrow.

	"We sail on the dawn tide," he bellows, "so don't ä	expect to find us still here if y'roll up late."
