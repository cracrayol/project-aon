	"Thanks...for nothing," you say, as you walk out of Š	the warehouse and return to the square. As you are Š	looking around and wondering where next to go, you Š	suddenly notice that there is something happening at Š	the end of a street that leads away from the Š	quayside. You decide to investigate and you soon Š	discover that the street leads to a large courtyard. Š	Here the women of Masama are selling their wares, Š	spread out upon gaily-decorated market stalls. Unlike Š	the warehouses and emporiums at the quayside, the Š	people who attend this market all appear to be Š	natives of the city. As you pass by one stall you Š	overhear two women talking about a place called Š	Kitaezi. One of them is insisting that the whole city Š	has been placed under a curse. You are about to turn Š	back and ask her more about this city when suddenly Š	you are approached by a tall woman who is swathed Š	from head to toe in a fine blue robe. Anxiously she Š	asks if you are a healer, and her piercing grey eyes Š	continually dart to the satchel slung over your Š	shoulder. It is as if she knows that you are carrying Š	the Moonstone.

	Your Kai sixth sense tells you that she means you no Š	harm. You sense that she is greatly troubled, and Š	when you ask what is wrong, she says that her  Š	daughter, Harni, is gravely ill. She pleads with you Š	to come and help her, and although you deny that you Š	are a healer, you feel compelled to answer her Š	desperate plea for help.
