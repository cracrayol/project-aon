	When first you enter the mists, it seems as if you ä	are no longer sailing upon a sea of water. It becomes ä	a blended sea and sky of deep blue light, without ä	horizon or boundary. A limitless space. Gradually you ä	detect vague shadows passing quickly by, then distant ä	sounds, like muffled whispers, surging then pulsing ä	away before you can catch the words. Then you see ä	globes of darkness hovering to and fro, and your Kai ä	senses scream a warning that these are invaders, evil ä	intruders in this realm of ghostly mist. They grow in ä	numbers and begin to spiral around your boat, ä	whispering and laughing and babbling all the while.
	You feel your boat gradually slowing until it ceases ä	to move at all. Fear grips you when you realise that ä	these mischievous black spheres have the power to ä	hold you prisoner, to keep you from ever reaching the ä	shores of Lorn. Suddenly the vague sounds and voices ä	in your mind begin to crystallize into words that you ä	can understand. 

	"ÈYou have proved your physical courage, foolish ä	follower of Kai. But now you must put your mental ä	strength to the test if you wish to find the Isle of ä	Lorn.È"

	The eerie voice laughs and you steel yourself to meet ä	its mental challenge.

	"ÈHow many heads are fixed upon the harbour gate of ä	Suhn ?È"
