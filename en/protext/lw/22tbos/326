	You whisper the words of the Brotherhood spell - ä	ÈSense EvilÈ and your suspicions are immediately ä	confirmed. This man is not trying to help you at all. ä	He is a charlatan, a sly and gifted liar who is ä	trying to lure you into a trap.

	Rather than follow him away from the quay, you tell ä	him that you have changed your mind and that you no ä	longer wish to find Captain Radyard. The man curses ä	you under his breath and then he hurries off into an ä	adjoining alleyway. You watch him disappear before ä	you walk across market square and enquire after ä	Radyard at the Masama Warehouse.
