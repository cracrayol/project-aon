	The Lucky Horse Inn is famous for its gaming tables
	which attract some of Magnamund's most notorious Š	gamblers. Even at this early hour of the afternoon Š	its tables are busy as fortunes are wagered, won, and Š	lost on the turn of a card or the roll of a die. Š	Gregor buys you a tankard of ale and together you Š	stand and watch an interesting game of 5-card Š	Lourdanian Draw unfold at a nearby table.
	
	After surviving the attack upon his ship, Gregor is Š	feeling lucky. When two players drop out of the game Š	he suggests the idea that you and he should take Š	their places.
	

	If you agree to his suggestion, you can join in the Š	game by turning to  â8â
	
	If you do not wish to gamble, you can leave the inn Š	and continue along the main street by turning to  â168â
