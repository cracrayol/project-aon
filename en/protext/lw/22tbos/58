	You leave the shop and depart from the city of Nhang Š	through its West Gate, following the main trade road Š	that leads to the city of Jazer, forty miles to the Š	west. There are many fellow travellers on this road. Š	Some, like you, travel alone and on foot. Others Š	journey in convoys of ox-drawn wagons heavily laden Š	with wares. You try to hitch a ride aboard these Š	convoys but without success, and so you resign Š	yourself to the fact that you have a long day's walk Š	ahead.

	At noon you come to village where the road enters Š	some hilly timberland. A sprawling taverna dominates Š	the village, providing meals for travellers. There Š	are more than a dozen wagons parked outside its doors Š	and many sullen-faced natives are sitting on nearby Š	benches eating their mid-day meals.


	If you wish to stop and enter the taverna, turn 
	to  â114â

	If you decide to continue on your way without Š	stopping, turn to  â323â
