	You rise from your seat and take a step towards the Š	Eldenoran Captain, but his crew are quick to react to Š	your move. They reach to the hilts of their swords Š	and several hurry to block your path to their leader. Š	You sense that this ugly incident could easily get Š	out of hand and lead to a murderously uneven combat Š	between the heavily armed Eldenorans and Jenkshi's Š	crewmen, none of whom are carrying weapons. A brawl  Š	between the two crews would jeopardise the success of Š	your quest and it could also cost many innocent men Š	their lives. Mindful of these facts, you know you Š	must try to avoid a fight breaking out at all costs.
