	The city watch surround you and guard you at spear-ä	point until two horse-drawn wagons come to take you ä	away to the city gaol. As you are herded aboard these ä	foul-smelling carriages, your weapons, Kai Weapon, ä	and backpack items are confiscated and dumped into a ä	wooden crate beside the driver's seat. (On your ä	ÈAction ChartÈ mark each of these items with an ä	asterisk [*] to indicate that they are no longer in ä	your possession, but do not erase them at this time. ä	Any Special Items you possess are allowed to remain ä	with you.)
	
	At the officer's command the wagons move off at a ä	speedy pace. After a few bruising minutes, your wagon ä	emerges from the gloomy streets and ascends a smooth ä	ramp which passes through the daunting gate of Ghol-ä	Tabras gaol. Above this gate flutters a flag which ä	depicts a black serpent entwined around the blade of ä	a silver scimitar. It is the personal emblem of ä	Sesketera, the ruler of this city, a man not known ä	for his kindness nor his mercy.
