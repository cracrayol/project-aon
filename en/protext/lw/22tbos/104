	Your Grand Mastery skill warns you that these ä	seemingly innocuous plants are Liera. Their petals ä	contain a powerful narcotic which can be ground down ä	to a fine powder and used in potions to make a person ä	susceptible to mental suggestion (mind control).

	There are sufficient plants here to produce two ä	Potions of Liera. If you wish to keep one or both of ä	these potions, record each one on your ÈAction ChartÈ ä	as a backpack item.
