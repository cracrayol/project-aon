	You steady yourself by wedging your foot firmly Š	between the guide ropes of the bridge, then you draw Š	an arrow to your bow and let it fly at the bandit Š	axeman. It strikes his axe below the blade and splits Š	the wooden haft in two. The bandit shrieks with Š	alarm, drops his shattered weapon, and then flees Š	into the jungle as fast as his skinny legs will carry Š	him. His confederates quickly lose their nerve when Š	they see you reaching for a second arrow and they, Š	too, turn tail and disappear into the trees.

	Suddenly you glimpse a face peering out from the Š	crevice in the gorge. You spin around and release Š	your second arrow, sending it whistling towards the Š	startled eyes of the bandit who is pulling the rope Š	attached to the underside of the bridge. He dodges Š	back into the darkness and your shaft shatters Š	harmlessly against the rocks, but in his panic to Š	avoid your arrow he accidentally lets the rope slip Š	from his hands.

	As the floor of the bridge ceases to sway, you Š	quickly remount your horse and coax him across to the Š	far side. The bandit's angry voice echoes through the Š	gorge as you make good your escape along the jungle Š	trail that continues beyond the bridge.
