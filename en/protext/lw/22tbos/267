	The Elder spreads the news to his people that you Š	have agreed to help them and they cheer you loudly. Š	The women of the village bring you food and wine Š	(restore 3 ENDURANCE points), and the children make Š	it their duty to see that your mule is watered and Š	fed.
	
	At sunset, you follow the elder and a dozen of the Š	village men to a rocky outcrop which overlooks the Š	settlement. They have prepared several hiding places Š	among the rocks where they can lie in wait for the Š	dragon. They are armed with spears and bows, and you Š	note that they have a plentiful supply of arrows. You Š	take cover with the elder and wait patiently for the Š	dragon to arrive. You do not have to wait very long. Š	In the fading light of dusk you see the creature come Š	gliding down from the mountains. The elder tells his Š	men to ready their bows, and as they carry out his Š	order, you see him smile. He seems to be relishing Š	the thought of avenging the damage this creature has Š	caused. The dragon circles above the village and then Š	comes swooping over the outcrop. It is now within Š	arrow range.
