	Following the city's signposts, you make your way ä	down to the ferry station. Adjacent to this station ä	is a marine timberyard and a chandler's warehouse. ä	The smell of freshly sawn timbers reminds you of the ä	Fryelund forest which surrounds your Kai monastery.
	It is a memory that makes you feel a little homesick. 
	The timberyard is deserted and so you decide to 
	sleep this night among its stacks of pine and oak.  

	Pick a number from the ÈRandom Number TableÈ.


	If the number you have chosen is  ‚0‚ - ‚4‚, turn to  ‚211‚

	If it is  ‚5‚ - ‚9‚, turn to  ‚13‚
