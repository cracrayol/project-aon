	You climb a steep path which ascends to the clifftop Š	park, and when you arrive there you are rewarded by a Š	spectacular view of the Gulf of Tentarium and the Š	city streets below. The park is empty of people, Š	except for a small group of men who are gathered Š	around the remains of a stone statue which lies Š	broken and overgrown with weeds. A plaque attached to Š	the shattered base declares that it was once a Š	likeness of Shasarak, the Wytch-King of Shadaki. He Š	was an infamous necromancer who inflicted a reign of Š	terror upon this land until finally he was defeated Š	and his empire destroyed in the year MS 5054.

	As you move nearer you see that the group is Š	listening to the rantings of a bald man who is Š	attired in grimy, tattered grey robes. His wild eyes Š	roll in his cadaverous face as he tries to persuade Š	his listeners to join with him in the overthrow of Š	the city's ruling council. Between rantings, he Š	offers them food from a large wooden bowl.
