	You force yourself up the ladder and emerge on the Š	foredeck amidst a tangle of rigging and ruined sails. Š	As you pull yourself onto the deck, you see that 
	the trader has lost every one of her masts and the Š	stern is slowly submerging beneath the relentless Š	waves. You scour the shattered main deck but you can Š	see no sign of survivors. Then you glimpse a hand Š	protruding from beneath a mass of debris, and you Š	stagger across the shifting deck towards it. Suddenly Š	the prow is struck by a cresting wave and you are Š	catapulted off the deck and into the angry sea.
