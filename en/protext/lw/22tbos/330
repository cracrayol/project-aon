	You shout to your companions to make a run for the Š	harbour and then you lead the way along the shadowy Š	streets. The clumping sound of booted feet and the Š	blare of a brass horn echoes among the surrounding Š	houses as the city watch raise the alarm and give Š	chase. Swiftly you and the crew outrun these armoured Š	guards but, to your dismay, when you reach the Š	harbour gate you discover that it is closed and Š	bolted.

	Quickly you enter an adjoining street in the hope of Š	finding another way through to the quay. At the end Š	of this street you come to a junction where a smaller Š	avenue crosses from east to west.


	If you wish to turn east into this avenue, turn 
	to  â258â

	If you decide to go west, turn to  â32â
