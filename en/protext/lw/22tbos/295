	You reach the ferry station as the vessel is leaving ä	and you are forced to leap from the jetty and cling ä	to its tailgate. The ferryman on the deck of the ä	vessel grabs your hands and helps you to climb ä	aboard. He then asks you to pay the fare of 2 Nobels ä	and your heart sinks when you remember that all your ä	money was stolen during the night. The ferryman ä	becomes impatient; he threatens to have you thrown ä	overboard if you do not stump up the fare. After some ä	arguing he finally agrees to accept one backpack item ä	in lieu of cash. (Delete from your ÈAction ChartÈ one ä	Backpack item of your own choosing.)

	You settle yourself at the bow rail and look around ä	at your fellow travellers. Most appear to be ä	merchants with wagons and handcarts that are loaded ä	with goods destined for the markets of Tiklu. It is ä	short voyage of twenty miles across the strait. As ä	the ferry approaches the landing jetty, your fellow ä	passengers get ready to leave. During the ä	disembarkation, one merchant's small cart is ä	overturned and his cargo is spilled onto the shore. ä	The other merchants push past him, but you feel sorry ä	for his plight and you help to calm his carthorse and ä	retrieve his goods. He is very grateful for your ä	assistance and he offers you a ride to Tiklu aboard ä	his cart which you willingly accept.
