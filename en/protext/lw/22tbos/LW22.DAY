	STORY SO FAR... para LW21 SOF plus synopsis of LW21, Holmgard to Š	Elzian.

	Briefing at Elzian re.route, Elder Magi contact [Lord Zinair] in Š	Suhn & final approach across éSea of Dreamsé to Lorn. Before leaving Š	Dessi, GM witnesses the death of an Elder Magi - 'cocoon-like' Š	scene; suss slow demise of Elder Magi and passing-over of power to Š	New Order Kai. Equipment & advice before leaving.
	
	Leave on Suhnese trading ship (Cptn Jenkshi & crew). Maintain Š	secrecy of mission. 3 days to Zharloum. Cross Gulf of Tentarium; Š	squall, sight raft & survivor. Pick up/leave. If pick up, then Š	survivor (Grendor Luggs) warns of Shadaki pirates (éincreases Š	chance of avoidanceé). Gives GM Special Item (later prompt). 

	Arrival in Zharloum (des.); overnight stop, take on fresh food. Go Š	ashore (inn - accidental insult or gesture leading to encounter Š	and early return to ship) or stay aboard (OK - no trouble).

	Get ready to sail. Farewell to survivor (if aboard). 4 days to Š	Ghol-Tabras. Second day enter Gulf of Ralzuha & see burning ship Š	(pirate lure) near small islets.

	Go to help and attacked by Shadaki buccaneers hiding in cove. Š	Outrun them but hit by missiles (pirate ships heavy with booty).

	Damage to Suhnese ship forces run for shore (small port) for Š	emergency repairs. Arrival at port 'Junkyard of Ralzuha'; poor Š	populace, hence not bothered by pirates. Natives friendly. Accept Š	offer to visit oracle statue ? (If yes, gives obscure advice Š	re.friendly dragon later). Repairs completed then leave port & Š	reach Ghol-Tabras 2 days later (evening).

	Des. Ghol-Tabras. Curfew in force. Harbour chief imposes heavy
	mooring charge on ship. Will accept cash only. Cptn Jenkshi must Š	sell some cargo to raise money (or ship & cargo impounded). Market Š	next day. Go ashore with crew and enter inn. Racial remarks about Š	Suhnese leads to brawl with Shadakine toughs. City guards enter Š	and arrest Suhnese; taken away in wagons to gaol in Sesketera's Š	citadel (taken with crew, or Cptn Jenkshi pleads for GM to help Š	release them). SPLIT. If with them GM is taken to cell; leads Š	attempted escape. If not, GM & Cptn attempt to break them out, Š	caught in the act. Either way GM to end up in gaol cell alone. 

	Escapes using KD's. One puzzle door. Enters private chambers and Š	sees Oriah (crying). Prompt for LW21 connection or fresh intro to Š	Oriah. Alarm raised by guards. 

	Oriah helps GM escape by way of secret passage. Confrontation with Š	Sesketera at exit from citadel
	(dawn). Brief fight; GM scars Sesketera & escapes to harbour. City Š	guards give chase. Suhnese ship now useless (guarded and unmanned) Š	so leaps aboard departing clipper (death option here) from harbour Š	wall.

Des.voyage out of G-T (islands Š	etc.) Fourth day drop anchor at 'X' Gap. Sight Sesketera's Š	flagship early morning - sus he's out to get GM at all costs. Š	Weigh anchor but powerful ship catches up and hails trader to Š	heave-to. Ultimatum = hand over GM or be blasted out of water. GM Š	volunteers to go. Longboat dispatched. During return GM slips over Š	side and swims for shore. Pirates laugh; GM susses something very Š	wrong. Hit by speeding croc; satchel torn away & sinks. Dive to Š	collect & fight w. croc (aka cover pic). Win; bloody cloud in Š	water convinces Sesketera that GM is dead (croc carcass drops to Š	sea bed).

	Crawl ashore; see ships depart in either direction after longboat Š	hunt seemingly satisfied that GM dead. Sus loss of BI's. Consult Š	map. Hilly terrain. Follow track, stay in sight of sea. Estimate Š	it's 300 miles to Masama = 6 days at 50 miles per day (tough Š	terrain). Desolate trek for 4 days then find good hill track. Š	Heavy rain. Crossing at River Ocka washed away by flood water. Š	Save drowning man being carried downstream by floodwaters. Both Š	beach near settlement. GM is reviving man when sees natives and Š	calls for help. Natives arrive; angry when see GM in company of Š	man. Draw weapons & surround GM. Elder informs GM that man is Š	thief & murderer, escaped last night during torrential storm. Š	Accuse GM of being his confederate. (Man unconscious so unable to Š	say otherwise). GM pleads innocent but not believed.
