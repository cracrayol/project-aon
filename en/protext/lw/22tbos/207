	Unfortunately your attempt to open the cell door Š	attracts the unwanted attention of the three gaolers Š	who occupy the guardroom at the end of the corridor. Š	Armed with studded clubs, they come to your cell with Š	the intention of punishing you severely. As soon as Š	the drawbolt is pulled back, they storm through the Š	doorway and lash out at you with their cruel staves.  	
	To save yourself from this beating you are forced to Š	fight them barehanded.
