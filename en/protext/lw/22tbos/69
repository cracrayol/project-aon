	While Jenkshi and the crew are busy repairing the Š	ship's hull, you are approached by Grooja, the town Š	elder. He is able to speak a little Sommlending and Š	he is asks if you would care to stay the night as a Š	guest in his humble home. He says that he would be Š	greatly honoured if you accepted his invitation and, Š	rather than risk hurting his feelings, you agree to Š	go.
	
	Grooja lives in the best hut in all of Dlash-da Š	Ralzuha. It is the best hut because it possesses a Š	door and a roof which does not leak when it rains. Š	Grooja's family prepare for you a meal of roasted Š	vulture meat and boiled snakes. After this unnusual Š	feast, his wife invites their twenty grandchildren to Š	come and entertain you with an ancient tribal dance Š	in which they each spin around and around for as long Š	as they can before they are violently sick. Whenever Š	this happens the other members of Grooja's noisome Š	clan scream and cheer them excitedly. When at last Š	this display of quaint tribal culture comes to a Š	natural end, Grooja's toothless wife sidles up to you Š	and suggests that you should pay a visit to the Š	'Shrine of the Oracle'. She assures you that this Š	wondrous shrine is famous throughout this region for Š	it dispenses infallible words of wisdom to all those Š	who would seek its counsel.
