	You follow Grooja out of his hut and along a vermin-ä	infested path which wends a tortuous route through a ä	maze of slum dwellings and festering rubbish dumps. ä	After a mile or so, this rough track ascends into a ä	wooded hillside and then ends upon a plateau which ä	overlooks the harbour. From here you can see Jenkshi ä	and his crew working on ÈThe AzanÈ by the light of a ä	hundred oily torches. With undisguised pride, Grooja ä	points to the Shrine of the Oracle and invites you to ä	avail yourself of its wisdom. The shine consists of a ä	man-sized statue constructed from rusting metal and ä	chunks of driftwood held together with nails, strips ä	of animal skin, and twisted steel wire. You decide to ä	humour Grooja and so you ask the statue to tell you ä	if there is anyone you should trust of distrust ä	during your long journey to Suhn. As expected, you ä	get no response. But then a wind arises and it makes ä	a faint whistling sound as it passes through the ä	holes in the statue. For a fleeting moment you think ä	you hear the words 'ÈBad...dragon...is goodÈ', but then ä	the wind dies and there is nothing but silence. ä	Grooja smiles. He seems to think that the oracle has ä	spoken a great truth. 

	"Come, we go now. The Oracle speaks but once a day. ä	It has given you good wisdom. You are blessed."
