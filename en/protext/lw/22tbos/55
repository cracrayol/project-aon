	Fear gnaws at your insides as you hear the villagers ä	approaching through the long grass. The pit is deep, ä	yet its walls are threaded with tree roots that make ä	for easy climbing. Quickly you take hold of them and ä	attempt to pull yourself out of this trap before your ä	pursuers arrive.

	Pick a number from the ÈRandom Number TableÈ. If you ä	possess Grand Huntmastery, add ‚3‚ to the number you ä	have chosen. If you possess a Rope, add ‚2‚. If your ä	current ENDURANCE score is 10 or lower, deduct ‚1‚.


	If your total score is ‚5‚  or lower, turn to  ‚44‚

	If it is  ‚6‚ or higher, turn to  ‚246‚
