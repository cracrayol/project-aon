	You brace yourself against the gunwale and draw an ä	arrow to your bow. Taking careful aim, you let it fly ä	towards the creature's head. The beast senses its ä	approach and lashes out at the onrushing missile with ä	its clawed hand in an attempt to slap it away. The ä	arrow's steel tip skewers its hand and the beast ä	shrieks with pain as green ichor drips freely from ä	the wound. Then, to your shocked surprise, it bites ä	the shaft in two and spits the pieces back at you.

	Angered by the pain of its wound, the creature turns ä	it ghastly stare on you and hisses vehemently. ä	Quickly you shoulder your bow and reach to your Kai ä	weapon in readiness to defend yourself from its ä	attack. Yet it does not attack; it continues to stalk ä	its chosen target. Gemulkin frees himself from the ä	wheel, but before he can get away, the beast is upon ä	him like a hungry lion. It grabs him by the throat ä	and lifts him off the deck. You race across the ä	slippery decking and raise your weapon to strike the ä	creature in the side. Callously the beast hurls ä	Gemulkin into the sea and then spins around to face ä	you. Your first blow opens a wound in its chest, ä	making it shriek loudly. But it recovers and it ä	lashes out at you to connect with your shoulder. The ä	force of the blow knocks you sideways and sends you ä	sliding across the slick deck to fall headlong ä	through an open cargo hatch.
