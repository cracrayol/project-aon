	You hurry across the hold and run through an open Š	bulkhead door into an adjacent cargo area which is Š	stacked with crates of food and barrels of water. On Š	the far side of this hold you see a wooden ladder Š	that ascends to a hatch in the foredeck. Your Kai Š	senses detect that there is also a concealed trapdoor Š	in the floor of the hold, close to the base of the Š	ladder.
	
	Suddenly you hear the cracking of timbers and you Š	sense that the creature has freed its claws from the Š	wall of the cargo hold behind you. You hear the Š	snake-like hiss of its breath and you know that you Š	have but a few seconds before it will come rushing Š	through open bulkhead door.
