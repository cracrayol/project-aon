	The sea is warm and its clarity makes it easy for you ä	to locate the massive hull of ÈThe TriasusÈ. Having ä	filled your lungs before you hit the water, you stay ä	submerged and strike out for the distant shore. Only ä	once you have passed beyond the shadow of Sesketera's ä	flagship do you come up for air. As you break the ä	surface you notice that the crew of ÈThe TriasusÈ are ä	scouring the sea, straining themselves to catch a ä	glimpse of where you are. A marine on the prow deck ä	spots you and, to your surprise, Sesketera's crew ä	begin to laugh and jeer.

	You are trying to fathom the reason for their ä	laughter when suddenly you are struck in the back by ä	a heavy, powerful blow.

	Pick a number from the ÈRandom Number TableÈ. If the ä	number you have chosen is odd (ie. 1,3,5,7,9) reduce ä	your ENDURANCE score by 3. If the number you have ä	chosen is even (ie. 0,2,4,6,8) reduce your ENDURANCE ä	score by 5.
