	The natives are angry. They come running towards the Š	river bank, screaming and slashing the air with their Š	primitive weapons. Their leader shouts at you, and Š	although his dialect is unfamiliar, you are able to Š	understand enough to hear that the man you have saved Š	from the river is a thief and a murderer. He escaped Š	from the settlement last night during the rain storm, Š	and the leader is accusing you of being his Š	accomplice and of helping him to escape. He says that Š	the river gods have brought you back to their village Š	to pay for your crimes. You attempt to protest your Š	innocence but the leader refuses to listen. He Š	confiscates all of your equipment, including your Kai Š	Weapon, your belt pouch, your backpack and the Š	satchel containing the Moonstone, and then he has his Š	men march you away to their village where you are Š	locked in a hut. Shouting through the closed door, he Š	tells you that the village elders will meet tomorrow Š	at noon to decide your fate.

	A few hours later you overhear two guards outside the Š	hut and you are shocked to learn that the man you Š	saved from the river has since been executed. They Š	say that the elders of the village decreed that he Š	should be weighted with rocks and thrown back into Š	the water. You have no wish to suffer a similar fate Š	and so you quickly set about finding a way to escape Š	from this hut.
