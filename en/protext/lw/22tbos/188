	You hand over your money to the ferryman and take a Š	place at the bow. As you wait for the vessel to cast Š	off, you look around at your fellow travellers and Š	notice that most are merchants with wagons and Š	handcarts loaded with goods destined for the markets Š	of Tiklu. It is short voyage of twenty miles across Š	the strait. When the ferry approaches the landing Š	jetty, your fellow passengers get ready to leave. As Š	they disembark, one merchant's small cart is Š	overturned and his cargo is spilled onto the shore. Š	The other merchants push past him, but you feel sorry Š	for his plight and you help to calm his carthorse and Š	retrieve his goods. He is very grateful for your Š	assistance and he offers you a ride to Tiklu aboard Š	his cart which you willingly accept.
