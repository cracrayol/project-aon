	You raise your bow and quickly fire an arrow at the ä	side of the creature's shimmering head. Yet it seems ä	to sense the approaching shaft and the beast destroys ä	it with a bolt of energy that emerges from the centre ä	of its being. Desperate now to save your stricken ä	mount, you rush forward and attack the creature with ä	your Kai weapon.
