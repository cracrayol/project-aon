	On reaching the far side of the square, you see a Š	narrow street flanked on either side by slums and Š	hovels. You reason it unlikely that you would find Š	Lord Zinair living in such a poor district, and so Š	you stop for a few moments to consider where best to Š	look for him. You decide that you should find 
	someone who knows the city well, someone who is sure Š	to have heard of the Dessian ambassador. Looking Š	around the square you see can see only two likely Š	sources of this information: a Soothsayers Shop, and Š	a City Guard patrol.
	

	If you wish to enquire at the Soothsayers Shop, turn Š	to  â53â

	If you wish to ask the City Guards, turn to  â172â
