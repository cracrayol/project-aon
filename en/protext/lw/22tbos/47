	You utter the words of the Old Kingdom spell - ä	ÈInvisible FistÈ - and project your hand at the ä	creature's head. The force of your spell makes the ä	beast stumble, but it quickly recovers its footing.

	Angered by the pain you have dealt it, the creature ä	turns it ghastly stare on you and hisses vehemently. ä	Quickly you reach to your Kai weapon in readiness to ä	defend yourself from its attack. Yet it does not ä	attack; it continues to stalk its chosen target. ä	Gemulkin frees himself from the wheel, but before he ä	can get away, the beast is upon him like a hungry ä	lion. It grabs him by the throat and lifts him off ä	the deck. You race across the slippery decking and ä	raise your weapon to strike the creature in the side. ä	Callously the beast hurls Gemulkin into the sea and ä	then spins around to face you. Your first blow opens ä	a wound in its chest, making it shriek loudly. But it ä	recovers and it lashes out at you to connect with ä	your shoulder. The force of the blow knocks you ä	sideways and sends you sliding across the slick deck ä	to fall headlong through an open cargo hatch.
