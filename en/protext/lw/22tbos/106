	Sesketera succeeds in fending off your arrow and, ä	with breathtaking speed, he lunges forwards and ä	cleaves your bow in two with the blade of his halberd ä	(delete this weapon from your ÈAction ChartÈ).
	
	You drop the sundered halves of your shattered bow ä	and leap back to avoid a sudden whirlwind flurry of ä	thrusts and sweeps that threaten to decapitate you. ä	Hurriedly you unsheathe your Kai weapon and the clang ä	of striking metal echoes throughout the hall as you ä	parry Sesketera's relentless rain of blows. Then the ä	sharp report of your colliding weapons is answered by ä	the dull ringing of a bell in a distant part of the ä	citadel. It is an alarm bell, and it is announcing ä	your escape from the dungeons of the gaol.
