	You wake the following morning to find that the Š	torrential rain has ceased. Lying in the mud at the Š	mouth of the cave are several orange-shaped fruits Š	which have been dislodged from the surrounding trees Š	by the deluge. You soon discover they are edible and Š	you enjoy some for breakfast before continuing your Š	trek (there are sufficient fruits for another 3 Š	Meals).

	The heavy overnight rains have transformed the hill Š	track into a muddy ditch which makes the going Š	difficult. Yet it is still the quickest way through Š	this jungle territory and you stay with the track Š	until it comes to the bank of the swollen River Ocka. Š	There was once a bridge at this point, but your Š	tracking skills tell you that it has been washed away Š	during the night. You are about to set off along the Š	bank in search of somewhere to cross when suddenly Š	you hear a desperate cry for help. You turn and see a Š	man being swept downstream by the river. His head is Š	barely above the surface and you can see at once that Š	he is near to drowning.
