	You use the power of your Grand Mastery to whip up a Š	cloud of dust from the ground. The sudden whirlwind Š	causes the crowd to panic and a clear space forms Š	around you and your elemental summonation as they Š	fight to get away. You direct the whirling dust cloud Š	at Wrok's henchmen, and as they are engulfed and Š	blinded by it, you and Melchar sieze the chance to Š	make good your escape from the racetrack.
