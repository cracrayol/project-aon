	You land on your back with a jolt that leaves you Š	gasping for breath, yet you sustain no injury from Š	your fall. You have landed on a bale of silk, one of Š	dozens stacked in this cargo hold. Above, framed in Š	the open hatchway, you can see the creature getting Š	ready to leap. Quickly you roll off the bale as it Š	drops into the hold, and your speedy action saves you Š	from its deadly talons as maniacally the creature Š	slashes the silk bale to ribbons.

	Hissing like an angry snake, it leaps after you and Š	lashes out again. This time it rakes its talons along Š	the wooden wall of the hull, barely inches above your Š	head. The tips of these razor-sharp claws become Š	embedded deeply in the timbers and for a few moments Š	the creature is held fast.
	
	
	If you wish to attack the creature while its talons Š	are stuck firmly in the hull, turn to  â82â
	
	If you choose to use this opportunity to try to evade Š	the creature, turn to  â143â
