	You estimate that you are less than half a mile from ä	the mainland coast - a comfortable distance for a ä	good swimmer, especially for one who possesses the ä	strength and stamina of a Kai Grand Master.

	You say farewell to Captain Radyard and he thanks you ä	for your selflessness. He orders his crew to hoist ä	the sails, and he tells his bo'sun to wave a white ä	flag from the stern deck to signal to Sesketera that ä	he is complying with his commands. A longboat is ä	launched from ÈThe TriasusÈ to collect you. It is ä	carrying an officer and six marines, each armed with ä	a half-pike and a Bor pistol. Radyard suggests that ä	you go to the head of the boarding ladder so that you ä	can surrender to the longboat's officer when he comes ä	aboard.

	"Who said anything about surrender ?" you retort.
	"But..I thought...", stutters the Captain. "I've no ä	intention of surrendering to Sesketera!" you say, and ä	before Radyard can utter another word, you vault over ä	the gunwale and plunge feet first into the clear blue ä	sea.
