	You intone the words of the Brotherhood Spell - ä	ÈSilenceÈ - and direct its energies at the sniper. He ä	blows his horn but no sound emerges. Thinking that it ä	is blocked he tries instead to shout a warning, but ä	again without effect. Suddenly he panics when he sees ä	you approaching. He loses his footing and tumbles ä	backwards from his perch to land heavily upon the ä	exposed roots of the tree. You hurry to his body and ä	discover that his neck has snapped. To your ä	disappointment, you also discover his blowpipe and ä	horn are both useless, having been damaged in the ä	fall.
	
	Quickly you hide his body in the undergrowth, and ä	then you move deeper into the jungle, guided and ä	drawn by the strange noise.
