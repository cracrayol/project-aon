	"If you won't pay for help, you won't get no help," Š	says the owner. Then he points to the door and says: Š	"Trade, or leave!" 
	
	You decide to leave. On returning to the square you Š	notice that there is something happening at the end Š	of a street that leads away from the quay. You decide Š	to investigate and you soon discover that the street Š	leads to a large courtyard. Here the women of Masama Š	are selling their wares, spread out upon gaily-Š	decorated market stalls. Unlike the warehouses and Š	emporiums at the quayside, the people who attend this Š	market all appear to be natives of the city. As you Š	pass by one stall you overhear two women talking Š	about a place called Kitaezi. One of them is Š	insisting that the whole city has been placed under a Š	curse. You are about to turn back and ask her more Š	about this city when suddenly you are approached by a Š	tall woman who is swathed from head to toe in a fine Š	blue robe. Anxiously she asks if you are a healer, Š	and her piercing grey eyes continually dart to the Š	satchel slung over your shoulder. It is as if she Š	knows that you are carrying the Moonstone.

	Your Kai sixth sense tells you that she means you no Š	harm. You sense that she is greatly troubled, and Š	when you ask what is wrong, she says that her  Š	daughter, Harni, is gravely ill. She pleads with you Š	to come and help her, and although you deny that you Š	are a healer, you feel compelled to answer her Š	desperate plea for help.
