	You tell the elder that you are on an important Š	journey. You say that you are sorry you cannot help Š	his village any further but you must leave at once. Š	He follows as you return to your mule and he pleads Š	with you to change your mind. When you refuse, you Š	sense a strange transformation taking place. His face Š	contorts with rage and your Kai senses detect an aura Š	of evil that is chillingly familiar. It is identical Š	to that which surrounded Ulonga the Shaman. Suddenly Š	he snatches an amulet from a chain hanging around his Š	neck and thrusts it at your mule. The air around it Š	crackles and a bolt of energy leaps from his hand to Š	strike the creature's head, rendering him Š	unconscious. The elder gives an evil laugh as he Š	raises his hand and points the amulet at your face.
