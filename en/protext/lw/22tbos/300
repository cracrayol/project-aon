	You reach Caeno in the early evening. For all its ä	great size and former splendour, this city has the ä	appearance of a half-deserted ruin. The famous grand ä	mansions of its northern quarter are now little more ä	than dilapidated shells, and its paved avenues are ä	broken and overgrown with weeds. Yet despite its ä	state of neglect and decay, Caeno is a crowded city, ä	especially at this time of the year.

	You discover why as you make your way through its ä	twisting, soot-blackened streets. On every other wall ä	there hangs a gaudy yellow poster announcing the ä	Caeno Derby, an annual race that attracts visitors ä	from all over Magnamund. The race is to be run ä	tomorrow and the inns and boarding houses are ä	overflowing with customers. After a long search, you ä	finally discover a shabby inn called ÈThe Song of the ä	Silver StarÈ that has a vacant room. The fat innkeeper ä	informs you with glee that bed and board will cost ä	you 6 Nobels, an exorbitant sum for such a run-down ä	establishment.

	"It's the derby" he says, without a hint of an ä	apology. "Beds is at a premium with so many visitors ä	around."

		
	If you wish to pay the innkeeper 6 Nobels, turn to  ä	‚259‚

	If you do not, turn to  ‚325‚
