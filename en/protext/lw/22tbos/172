	Your request for assistance is greeted with suspicion Š	by the hard-faced guardsmen. Your northern features Š	and travel-stained clothes clearly do not impress Š	them, for they ignore your requests and begin asking Š	some questions of their own. They ask you to show Š	them what you are carrying in your satchel, and they Š	ask why you are carrying weapons in a public Š	marketplace contrary to the law of Suhn. When you Š	hesitate to answer, they immediately place you under Š	arrest. For a moment you consider making a run for Š	it, but then you notice that each guard is armed with Š	a crossbow and you decide that it would be suicidal Š	to try to escape.
