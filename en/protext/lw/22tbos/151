	You utter the words of the Brotherhood spell - ä	ÈLightning HandÈ - and point at the wall of the hut, at ä	a place directly opposite the guarded door. A tingle ä	runs down your arm and a bolt of blue-white fire arcs ä	from your outstretched hand to blow a ragged hole ä	through the bamboo timbers. You run at this hole and ä	barge the weakened wall with your shoulder. It ä	splinters and splits open, enabling you to force ä	yourself through the gap and escape.
