	You swallow your pride and politely you ask the         Š	Captain to release the crewman. Your request is met Š	by a torrent of shouts and coarse laughter from the Š	drunken Eldenorans, yet the Captain does as you ask; Š	he releases his grip and lets the gasping crewman Š	drop in a heap to the taproom floor. You motion to Š	the others that the time has come to leave. Without a Š	word they abandon their tables and move towards the Š	door, pausing only to pick up their injured comrade Š	as they go. With the threats and crude curses of the Š	Eldenorans ringing in your ears, you walk away from Š	the Three Capstans Inn and return to the harbour. The Š	crew feel angry and frustrated by what has happened, Š	yet they also know that your cool-headed intervention Š	probably saved them from far worse treatment at the Š	hands of the brutish Eldenorans, and for that they Š	are grateful.
