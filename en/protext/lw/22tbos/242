	You grab the sides of the ladder and climb towards Š	the hatch. The rungs are slippery and the slick Š	leather of your soles does not make for a speedy  Š	ascent. Then you hear a loud hissing and you look Š	down to see that the creature is directly below you. 
	Suddenly the ladder lurches violently as the ship is Š	struck by another wave. There is a loud roar, then Š	the hatch above your head collapses and you are hit Š	by a deluge of sea water that sweeps you off the Š	ladder. You crash down upon the creature's head, Š	stunning it, and the force of your fall sends it Š	reeling to the floor.

	Frantically you scramble to your feet and reach for Š	your Kai weapon to finish the beast before it can Š	recover. But to your horror you discover that your Š	weapon is not at your side; it fell from your belt Š	when you were swept off the ladder. You look around  Š	and catch sight of it sliding across the floor Š	towards the bulkhead door.

	If you wish to retrieve your Kai weapon, turn to  â227â

	If you choose to attack the beast with a normal Š	weapon, before it fully recovers, turn to  â176â
