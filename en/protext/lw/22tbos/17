	You recite the words of the Brotherhood spell - ä	ÈLevitationÈ - and rise rapidly into the air. Moments ä	later a second bolt of energy leaps from the elder's ä	hand, but this passes harmlessly below your feet. The ä	old man emits a cry of shocked surprise at your ä	sudden ascension, and then he runs towards the ä	village, shrieking hysterically.
		
	You speak the words which counter the spell and glide ä	gently back to the ground. You hear the elder calling ä	the men of the village to gather their weapons. He ä	denounces you, and he orders that his men capture you ä	and put you to the sword. Quickly you turn and run ä	towards the ridge. You are determined to reach the ä	trail that lies beyond it and make a speedy escape ä	from this village and its evil leader.
