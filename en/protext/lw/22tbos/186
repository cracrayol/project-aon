	Zinair has made preparations for your journey by boat Š	to the Isle of Lorn. This fabled home of the Shianti Š	lies 120 miles from the Port of Suhn, and has been Š	protected for thousands of years from the attentions Š	of man by enchantments, magical mists, and mage Š	winds.
	
	"Only by virtue of your possession of the Moonstone Š	can this voyage be undertaken with any hope of Š	success," he says. "I have been in mind-contact with Š	the Shianti, and they are ready to receive you."
	
	You sense that Zinair is proud of your successes and Š	achievements during the quest so far, but you also Š	sense that he is ill at ease and you ask him what is Š	wrong.

	"The Moonstone will facilitate your passage through Š	the Sea of Dreams to the Isle of Lorn, Grand Master. Š	But you should know that this journey could still Š	prove perilous. The Shianti no longer have control Š	over the forces that exist within this enchanted Š	region. Until you reach the shores of Lorn, your fate Š	will be entirely in your own hands."

	It is a daunting message but you do not allow it Š	weaken your resolve. You stare Lord Zinair Š	confidently in the eye as you reply:

	"It need be no other way, my Lord. I am ready."

	Zinair smiles. "So be it, Grand Master. But now you Š	must sleep, for you sail at dawn."
