	The crowd gets denser as you get nearer to the main Š	exit and the increased numbers slow down the speed of Š	your escape. Wrok communicates by means of hand Š	signals with two of his henchmen who occupy a Š	platform beside the main gate. As you pass below this Š	platform they leap into the crowd and attempt to Š	block your escape.
