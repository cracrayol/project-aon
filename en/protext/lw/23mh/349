	Your combined Kai skills warn you that the door is Š	guarded by a powerful spell of protection. This Š	spell, in turn, is masked by another spell to prevent Š	its detection. Karvas reaches out to pull the lever Š	but you quickly snatch his hand away. To touch this Š	spell-protected lever with a bare hand could prove Š	fatal.


	If you wish to attempt to discharge the spell by Š	throwing something at the door, turn to  â330â

	If you wish to try to open the door by striking the Š	lever down with the tip of your Kai Weapon, turn 
	to  â146â
