	In desperation, to save the prince's life, you Š	unsheathe your Kai Weapon and strike the horn clean Š	out of the Inquisitor-Major's hands. Your blow Š	cleaves his accursed horn in two and sends its Š	sundered halves spinning through the air. The Š	Inquisitor-Major bellow with rage and orders his men Š	to attack you. Frantically they level their lances Š	and make an haphazard attack.
