	On reaching the fortress ruins, you dismount and lead Š	your horses through its rubble-strewn main gate. Š	Within its crumbling walls there stands a keep, a Š	cylindrical structure of time-worn masonry. The upper Š	parts have collapsed leaving huge chunks of broken Š	stone heaped around its base. Where once stood a gate Š	of gleaming bronze now only a blackened hole remains. Š	It provides access to the inner hall and hurriedly Š	you enter to get out of the torrential rain.

	Engravings in the ceiling and walls of this derelict Š	hall tell you that this fortress was once occupied by Š	the Elder Magi. Both you and Karvas are fascinated by Š	the intricate carvings and you decide to split up and Š	explore this hall further. In an alcove at its north Š	side you discover a shrine dedicated to the God Kai. Š	Clumps of wild laumspur are growing around its base Š	and you find that there is enough here for 3 potions. Š	(Each potion is a backpack item. It will restore 4 Š	ENDURANCE points when swallowed after combat)

	You are examining the shrine more closely when Š	suddenly you hear Karvas scream out in alarm.
