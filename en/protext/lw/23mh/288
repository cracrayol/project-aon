	While you are examining the valuable items that fill Š	the shelves of this luxurious apartment, you become Š	aware that this is Baron Sadanzo's personal chamber. Š	Karvas inspects the golden ornaments and tapestries Š	with a critical eye. He informs you that most of this Š	treasure has been ill-gotten, either looted from the Š	estates of the Baron's enemies, or purchased abroad Š	with tax money extorted from the citizens of Cavalia.
	From among the vast array of treasures hoarded here, Š	there are only three items that catch your eye: a Š	Golden Hunting Horn, a Jewelled Tankard, and Š	Sadanzo's Seal.

	These three treasures are all Special Items. If you Š	decide to take one (or more) of them, you must carry Š	them in your Backpack. Each of these Special Items Š	will take up one space in your Backpack. You must Š	discard a backpack item in their favour if you Š	already carry the maximum number permissible.

	Having satisfied yourself that you have examined Š	every item of interest in this chamber, you motion Š	Karvas to follow as you draw aside the draperies and Š	explore the adjoining chamber.
