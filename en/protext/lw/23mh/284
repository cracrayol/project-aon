	You tell Karvas the bad news and quietly you both Š	slip away from the taproom by a rear door. Beyond Š	this door is a corridor which passes through the Š	tavern's kitchen and out into the courtyard. Once you Š	are outside, you hurry across to the stables to fetch Š	your horses. You are about to enter when suddenly you Š	notice the body of a young boy lying partially buried Š	beneath a heap of straw. By the colour and cut of his Š	clothing, you recognise the body to be that of the Š	stable boy who took charge of your horses when you Š	first arrived here. Swiftly you unsheathe your Kai Š	Weapon as you enter the stables. Your caution is Š	justified, for as soon as you pass through the stable Š	door, you are attacked by six Cavalian bandits who Š	are lying in wait for you and Karvas.
