	You approach to within thirty yards of the east gate Š	by means of a drainage ditch that runs parallel to Š	the rutted road. The heavy iron gate is open but the Š	way through to the city beyond is blocked by four Š	soldiers, each clad in a suit of shiny armour made Š	from lacquered steel scales and hardened leather. Š	They are armed with spears and maces, and their Š	shields display the head of a tiger-like creature Š	with ferocious fangs. It is the emblem of Autarch Š	Sejanoz - the ruler of Bhanar.
	
	Two of the soldiers stand rigidly to attention in the Š	middle of the road with the hafts of their spears Š	crossed to bar entry. Their comrades are seated Š	beside them on benches set into alcoves on either Š	side of the open gateway. A ragged white line appears Š	to have been drawn along the threshold of the gate, Š	but when you magnify your vision you realise that Š	this line is nothing more than a trail of bird Š	droppings. On a tiled ledge above the arch of the Š	gateway you can see a long line of roosting crows. Š	They appear almost invisible against the jet black Š	stonework of the parapet.

	After watching the guards for several minutes you are Š	sure that they are all alert and observant. It would Š	be difficult to get past these men without their Š	knowledge. If you are to gain entry to the city by Š	this route, first you will have to create a diversion Š	to draw away these vigilant guards.
