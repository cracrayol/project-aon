	Your brave attempt to disengage the lock proves Š	unsuccessful and so you decide on a different course Š	of action. You and Karvas agree that you will try to Š	attack and overpower the gaolers at the first Š	opportunity. Patiently you bide your time until an Š	hour later, when you hear footsteps in the corridor Š	outside followed by the sound of the tumbler lock Š	spinning. The door creaks open and in strides the Š	Knight Bachelor, accompanied by an escort of six Š	armed guards. The knight is holding a short-bladed Š	sword in one hand, and a wooden bowl filled with Š	vile-smelling gruel in the other. He offers to bowl Š	to Prince Karvas at arm's length.
	
	"Welcome to your royal apartment," he says, in a Š	sneering tone. "I've had the cook prepare you some Š	food after your long journey home, Prince Karvas. I Š	do hope you enjoy it. It's a meal fit for a king who Š	will never be."
	
	Karvas is angered by the knight's insolence and he Š	slaps the bowl of gruel out of his hand. The arrogant Š	knight laughs, but before he can step away and leave Š	the cell, you spring forward like a pouncing tiger Š	and attempt to grab the sword from his hand. 
	"Slay him!" screeches the knight, as he struggles to Š	free himself. Instantly the guards rush at you with Š	their weapons raised in eager readiness to carry out Š	his order.
