	You swim to the edge of the moat and drag yourself Š	out of the stinking water. As you take hold of the Š	prince's hand and haul him out onto the bank, you see Š	a group of horsemen riding across the drawbridge. Š	Most are armed with lances bearing Sadanzo's eagle's-Š	head pennant, and their red-faced leader is shouting Š	and pointing at you with his sword. 

	Arrows continue to fall. They thud into the muddy rim Š	of the moat and splinter on the paved road that Š	encircles the citadel. You grab Karvas by his cloak Š	and pull him to his feet; it is too dangerous to stay Š	here a moment longer. On the far side of the paved Š	road you can see a row of boarded-up houses, an Š	alleyway, and a baker's shop. 


	If you wish to attempt to escape from the deadly hail Š	of arrows by running into the alleyway, turn to  â157â

	If you wish to try to escape by entering the baker's Š	shop, turn to  â30â
