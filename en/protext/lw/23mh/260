	"I mean the Prince no harm," you say. "I have word of Š	his homeland that is of vital importance. I must find Š	him and speak with him as quickly as I am able."

	The blacksmith glances over his shoulder and looks at Š	you with undisguised suspicion. He takes note of the Š	cut and style of your tunic and cloak, and his eyes Š	linger momentarilly when he sees your belt pouch. The Š	thought occurs to you that perhaps the blacksmith Š	might be persuaded to talk in exchange for some gold.

		
	If you wish to offer some gold crowns to the Š	blacksmith in return for what he knows about Prince Š	Karvas, turn to  â209â

	If you choose not to offer him a bribe, turn to  â31â
