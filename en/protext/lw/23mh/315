	You are moving along the trail when suddenly your ä	Magnakai pathsmanship skills alert you to danger. ä	Immediately you halt and scan the surrounding woods, ä	fearing an ambush. Seconds later you detect the ä	danger; it is a concealed pit which bisects the track ä	a few yards ahead. It has been covered with pine ä	branches and camouflaged by a thin layer of earth and ä	stones, so as to make it indistinguishable from the ä	rest of the trail. You warn Acraban of its position ä	and motion him to leave the trail and skirt around ä	this hidden trap. He obeys, but within moments you ä	detect a second pit hidden amongst the undergrowth. ä	You hiss a warning to Acraban to halt just as he is ä	about to step upon it.
