	You are stunned by the shock of impact upon hitting ä	the water (lose 2 ENDURANCE points), but swiftly you ä	muster your senses and fight to stay astride your ä	horse. Prince Karvas and his mount come crashing down ä	into the water nearby and, in a tangle of flailing ä	limbs, you are all swept away by the river's ä	irresistible current.

	You are sped along by the rushing water for more than ä	five miles before you reach a stretch of shallows at ä	a bend in the river. Here you are able to regain ä	control of your frightened horses and coax them ä	towards the bank. Bruised and bedraggled, you stagger ä	out of the water and collapse on the muddy shore, ä	gasping for breath.
