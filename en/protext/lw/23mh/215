	The sound of fighting has been heard in the tavern Š	and a group of anxious locals, led by the tavern-Š	keeper and armed with pitchforks and staves, are Š	gathering outside in the courtyard. Rather than Š	attempt to reason with them, you and Karvas saddle Š	two fresh horses and gallop out of the stables as Š	fast as you can. The tavern-keeper and his patrons Š	scatter in all directions to avoid being trampled as Š	you race across the courtyard and escape onto the Š	highway beyond.

	Despite your fatigue, you force yourselves to ride Š	all night. Early next morning, you stop to rest in a Š	small coppice that borders the highway. Before you Š	sleep, you must eat a Meal or lose 3 ENDURANCE points Š	(unless you possess the discipline of Grand Š	Huntmastery).
