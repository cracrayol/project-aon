	You speak the words of the Brotherhood spell - ä	ÈCounterspellÈ - and direct its power at the whirling ä	swords. The blades are slowed by the effects of your ä	spell, but the magic that animates them is far ä	stronger than your own. You have slowed them but this ä	will not prevent them from attacking again.

	Once more the deadly blades draw sparks from the ä	stone ceiling, and then they come whirling down ä	towards your head.
