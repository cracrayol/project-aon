	In the ensuing confusion, Sadanzo attempts to flee Š	the platform and escape with his entourage of robber Š	knights. Marshal Phedros rushes forward to examine  Š	the shattered pieces of Sadanzo's gem, and at once he Š	recognises that they are the remnants of an evil Š	artifact crafted by Naar - the King of the Darkness.

	He turns to the bewildered crowd and denounces 
	Sadanzo as a disciple of Naar: a treasonable offence Š	in Siyen that is punishable by death. He orders the Š	Royal Guard to pursue and arrest Sadanzo immediately. Š	"Find him and take him to the palace dungeons," he Š	commands. Upon hearing this, a vast section of the Š	stunned crowd roar their approval and sporadic Š	fighting breaks out as followers of Sadanzo attempt Š	to battle their way out of the square. Marshal Š	Phedros orders that the city gates be sealed, and Š	then he commands the Royal Court Cavalry to hunt down Š	Sadanzo's robber knights, in every quarter of Seroa, Š	and bring them to justice. As these noble troopers Š	eagerly set about their task, Phedros turns to Prince Š	Karvas and hugs him to his chest.
	"Welcome home at last," he says, his voice wavering Š	with emotion, "welcome home...King Karvas."
