	Your worthy attempt to disengage the lock proves Š	unsuccessful and so you decide on a different course Š	of action. You and Karvas agree that you will try to Š	attack and overpower the gaolers at the first Š	opportunity. Patiently you bide your time until, an Š	hour later, you hear footsteps in the corridor Š	outside. They are followed by the sound of the Š	tumbler lock spinning. Then the door creaks open and Š	in strides the Knight Bachelor, accompanied by an Š	escort of six armed guards. The knight is holding a Š	short-bladed sword in one hand, and a wooden bowl Š	filled with vile-smelling gruel in the other. He Š	offers to bowl to Prince Karvas at arm's length.
	
	"Welcome to your royal apartment," he says, in a Š	sneering tone. "I've had the cook prepare you some Š	food after your long journey home, Prince Karvas. I Š	do hope it meets with your approval. It's a meal fit Š	for a king who will never be."
	
	Karvas is angered by the knight's insolence and he Š	slaps the bowl of gruel out of his hand. The arrogant Š	knight laughs, but before he can step away and leave Š	the cell, you spring forward like a pouncing tiger Š	and attempt to grab the sword from his hand. 
	"Slay him!" screeches the knight, as he struggles to Š	free himself from your grasp. Instantly the guards Š	rush at you with their weapons raised in eager Š	readiness to carry out his order.
