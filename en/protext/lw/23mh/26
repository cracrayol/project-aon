	The trader pockets your bribe and bids you follow him Š	to a smaller room at the rear of the warehouse. In Š	the quiet privacy of this adjoining room he tells you
	all he knows about Prince Karvas of Siyen.

	"This man Karvas does not live here in the city," he Š	says. "He did for a while, when he first came to Š	Sheasu ten years ago, but then a young woman arrived Š	and they got married. They live on the north coast of Š	the island somewhere. I've not seen them since the Š	day they left Mydnight."

	You thank the trader for his information and leave Š	the warehouse. Outside, on the quay, you resolve to Š	explore the tangle of alleyways that make up the Š	city's eastern quarter in the hope of finding someone Š	else who is willing to tell or sell what they know Š	about the prince. Unfortunately, your efforts garner Š	no further information. As the sun begins to settle Š	on the horizon, you finally abandon your search and Š	hurry back through the darkening passageways towards Š	the market square.
