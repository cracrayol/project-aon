	The farmer seems bemused by your refusal. His fee is ä	very reasonable, especially when compared to the ä	charge you would be expected to pay for crossing the ä	river at the Voshno Bridge. When he tells you that ä	there are no other river crossings for thirty miles ä	in either direction, you ask if he would accept ä	something other than cash in return for the use of ä	his raft. After a few moments thought, he says that ä	he would accept either 1 Weapon or 1 Backpack Item.

	If you possess sufficient cash, you can still pay the ä	farmer a fee of 8 Lune, or 2 Gold Crowns. If you do ä	not have enough money, you must give him either 1 ä	Weapon or 1 Backpack Item of your choice. (Make the ä	appropriate changes to your ÈAction ChartÈ.)
	
	The farmer ferries you and your horse across the ä	river, and then he goes back to collect Karvas and ä	his mount. Once the prince is safely across, you bid ä	the cheerful man farewell and ride away from the ä	river, heading east. You notice that Prince Karvas is ä	smiling as he rides across this lush river valley and ä	you ask him why he is so happy. He explains that the ä	Ioma is the political boundary between the realms of ä	Lunarlia and Siyen, and having crossed the river you ä	are now on Siyenese soil. After ten years in exile he ä	has, at last, returned to his homeland.
	
	Dusk is turning to darkness when you come to a road  
	that traverses the plain to the east of Voshno. Your ä	horses are tired and so you decide to camp for the ä	night in a small wood that borders this road. Before ä	you rest, you must eat a Meal or lose 3 ENDURANCE ä	points (unless you possess the discipline of Grand ä	Huntmastery).
