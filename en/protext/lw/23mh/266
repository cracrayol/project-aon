	After tethering your horses to a rail outside the Š	Stonefist Tavern, you pause to stretch your travel-Š	weary limbs before entering by a red oak door. The Š	interior is pleasantly cool, yet the air is soured by Š	the smell of sweat and stale beer. A gaily-coloured Š	parrot is perched in the rafters, squawking Š	tunefully. Below its perch is a circular table where Š	seven soldiers from the town's garrison sit playing Š	cards. You approach the bar and the weasly tavern Š	keeper unhooks two pewter tankards from the wall and Š	thuds them down onto the beer-soaked counter.

	"Ale for two?" he enquires, and you nod your ascent.
	As he fills the tankards with frothing beer he says: Š	"That'll be 8 Lune, if you please".

	The Lune is the currency of Lunarlia. 4 Lune are Š	equivalent to 1 Gold Crown (or 10 Ren). Prince Karvas Š	has only linen Torqs which are not readily accepted Š	beyond the shores of Sheasu. You can pay for the ales Š	either in Gold Crowns or Ren.


	If you wish to pay the tavern-keeper 2 Gold Crowns, Š	turn to  â37â

	If you choose to pay him 20 Ren, turn to  â241â
