	The searing flash of the lightning strike burns the ä	skin on your face and hands (lose 4 ENDURANCE ä	points), and leaves you blinded for a few fearful ä	minutes. When your vision returns, you muster all of ä	your Kai senses and focus them on the narrow strip of ä	land which seperates the fissures. Bolts of searing ä	energy leap out of these chasms and soar past the ä	skyship on either side to explode with thunderous ä	cacophony among the roiling clouds. The crew cower ä	with terror, but you maintain your nerve and let your ä	Kai skills take full control of the wheel. After ä	several nerve-racking miles the fissures eventually ä	taper off and then disappear completely. As the ä	ÈStarstriderÈ emerges from the gauntlet of deadly white ä	fire, the crew give a loud cheer in appreciation of ä	your skilful helmsmanship. Gladly you acknowledge ä	their praise, but you keep a grip on the helm for ä	your Kai senses are screaming a warning that the ä	danger is not yet over.
