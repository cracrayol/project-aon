	You are halfway through the portal when the missile ä	strikes you between the shoulder blades. The impact ä	numbs your senses and sends you somersaulting across ä	an alleyway outside the warehouse: lose 5 ENDURANCE ä	points. 
	
	Although you have been hit squarely by the ä	projectile, your backpack has prevented it from ä	penetrating your body. The impact has, however, ä	punched a hole in your pack and destroyed four the ä	items you are carrying. (Erase from your ÈAction ChartÈ ä	any 4 items you have recorded on your Backpack list.)
	
	Your return to the ground is cushioned by a carpet of ä	rotting refuse and canvas sacking. Stunned by the ä	missile's impact, you are only dimly aware of Prince ä	Karvas as he grabs the front of your tunic and lifts ä	you to your feet. With his help you make a hurried ä	escape along the dark passageway towards an adjoining ä	torchlit street.
