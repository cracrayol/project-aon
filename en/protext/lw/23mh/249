	You urge your horse towards the wooded hillock and Š	enter the trees with just seconds to spare before the Š	leading fanji come flashing past. You look about you Š	but Karvas is nowhere to be seen. You fear he has Š	been trampled by the stampede, but then he suddenly Š	appears from out of the thundering wall of beasts. He Š	is bruised and battered but he is still astride his Š	horse and in full control of him. He veers his Š	frightened steed away from the herd and comes Š	galloping up the slope of the hillock towards the Š	sanctuary of the trees. He pulls to a halt by your Š	side and strokes the neck of his whinneying horse to Š	reassure and calm him.

	As the herd rush past the hillock, you glimpse more Š	than a dozen horsemen who are galloping close behind Š	them. They are hunters and they are picking off the Š	best fanji at close quarters with bows and spears. Š	Two of these fur-clad plainsmen see you and Karvas Š	recovering among the trees, and instantly they steer Š	their horses away from the herd and urge them towards Š	the hillock. You sense that they suspect you and the Š	prince are after their quarry, and as they ride Š	closer, they mouth curses and fire their bows at you. Š	Their steel-tipped shafts arc through the air and Š	thud into the trees closeby.
