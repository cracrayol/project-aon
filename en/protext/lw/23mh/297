	Your blow unsaddles your enemy and sends him crashing Š	into the trees that border the trail. His followers Š	curse you and they raise their swords and maces in Š	readiness to strike as you come towards their line. Š	But you do not give them this opportunity. Hurriedly, Š	you rein your horse about and gallop back along the Š	trail towards Karvas. In the distance you can see Š	that the tree is burning less fiercely now. On Š	approaching the prince, you call for him to follow as Š	you race along trail towards the flaming pine.
	
	Bravely your horse makes a tremendous leap across the Š	tree to land surefootedly on the trail beyond. As you Š	bring him to a halt, you pat his neck in praise for Š	his courageous action. Moments later, you see Karvas Š	come leaping over the trunk and you cheer his Š	masterful display of horsemanship. With a wave of Š	your Kai weapon you beckon him to follow as you make Š	good your escape into the foothills of the Dammerdon Š	Mountains.
