	"Please forgive me, sir," you say, "but I and my Š	companion are just simple journeymen from Sommerlund. 
	We are not spies. Please, we did not mean to insult Š	you with our silence. We are not familiar with your Š	customs. In our land, it is not permitted for men of Š	our lowly rank to speak to a Knight until he gives Š	his permission. Please, kind sir, let us go on our Š	way."

	Coolly the Knight Bachelor stares into your eyes. Š	When he gets no reaction from you, he turns his head Š	and fixes the prince with the same cold, unblinking Š	gaze. He knows nothing of Sommlending custom but he Š	does know that the clothes you are wearing support Š	your story. Yet he appears to be not entirely Š	convinced. Your horses are Bhanarian steeds and he Š	recognises them to be so by the distinctive Š	embellishments that adorn their bridles and saddles. 
	
	Your Kai sixth sense informs you that this Knight Š	Bachelor is a greedy and ambitious young man who is Š	hungry for promotion. He is thinking of arresting you Š	and Prince Karvas on the charge that you are spies in Š	order to impress his peers in Cavalia. You know that Š	you must act swiftly if you are to avoid this.


	If you wish to offer the Knight Bachelor a bribe in Š	the hope that he will allow you and Karvas to go on Š	your way, turn to  â161â

	If you decide not to attempt to bribe him, turn 
	instead to  â95â
