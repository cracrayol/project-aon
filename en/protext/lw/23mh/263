	You dive to avoid your enemy's lance, timing your Š	move to perfection. As you roll over and spring back Š	to your feet, so you lash out with your Kai weapon Š	and its tip cuts clean through the belly-strap of his Š	saddle. Moments later, he tumbles from his horse and Š	crashes heavily among the trees that border the Š	trail. 
	
	His followers curse you bitterly when their leader Š	fails to stand. They fear he is either unconscious or Š	has broken his neck in the fall. Using your Kai Š	skills, you command your horse to come to you and he Š	obeys at once. Before the Bakhasians can enact their Š	revenge, you are able to mount up and ride back Š	towards Karvas. In the distance you can see that the Š	tree is now burning less fiercely. On approaching the Š	prince, you call for him to follow as you race along Š	trail towards the flaming pine. Bravely your horse Š	makes a tremendous leap across the tree to land Š	surefootedly on the trail beyond. As you bring him to Š	a halt, you pat his neck in praise for his courageous Š	action. Moments later, you see Karvas come leaping Š	over the trunk and you cheer his masterful display of Š	horsemanship. The Bakhasians choose not to follow Š	you. They break off their pursuit and allow you to Š	make good your escape into the foothills of the Š	Dammerdon Mountains.
