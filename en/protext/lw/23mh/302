	You are five miles clear of the fissures when the ä	steering becomes dangerously erratic. The ÈStarstriderÈ ä	is losing altitude and her deck is beginning to tilt ä	alarmingly to starboard. Soon it becomes almost ä	impossible to stand upright. Acraban appears from ä	below and valiently he struggles across the sloping ä	deck to join you at the helm. The young sorcerer is ä	gaunt and exhausted, and his ginger hair is matted ä	with grime and sweat. Clearly his efforts to repair ä	the ailing skyship have severely drained his magical ä	energies.

	"We have lost one stabiliser and the other is badly ä	damaged," he says, grimly. "I have done all I can to ä	repair it but I fear it may fail at any moment. ä	Without stabilisers we will not stay airborne."
	
	Acraban takes the helm and orders his crew to prepare ä	for a crash landing. Some of the men tie themselves ä	to the ship's superstructure, whilst others stand ä	free of the rails and pray for the protection of ä	Goddess Ishir. Prince Karvas has found refuge in a ä	rope locker bolted to the main deck. He lifts the lid ä	and urges you to join him. There is sufficient room ä	for two.


	If you wish to climb into the rope locker alongside ä	Prince Karvas, turn to  ‚79‚

	If you choose to stay with Acraban at the ship's ä	helm, turn to  ‚199‚
