	In one fluid practiced movement, you draw an arrow to Š	your bow and let it fly towards the onrushing lancer. Š	The man's eyes widen with terror as he sees your Š	deadly shaft hurtling towards him, and desperately he Š	twists aside to avoid it. The arrow misses by a Š	hair's breadth, yet the lancer does not survive your Š	shot. He loses his balance and tumbles out of the Š	saddle to crash down, head first, upon the Š	cobblestoned passageway.
