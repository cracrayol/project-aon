	You speak the words of the Brotherhood spell -ä	ÈLevitationÈ - and feel your feet leaving the dusty ä	street as you ascend effortlessly towards the second ä	storey window. When you draw level with the window ä	you counter the spell and step through its tall frame ä	onto a stone stairway beyond. This circular staircase ä	leads to the top of the tower which commands a ä	magnificent view of the city. Aided by your night ä	vision, you are able to locate stables less than a ä	mile to the north of the tower. You commit their ä	location to memory and then hurriedly you descend the ä	stairs and return to the window. Once more you use ä	your Brotherhood magic, this time to slow your ä	descent as you step through to the street below. 

	Prince Karvas is delighted to hear that there are ä	stables in the city, and he insists that you set off ä	for them at once. He is leading the way out of the ä	warehouse ruins when suddenly the tower bell begins ä	to toll once more. Moments later, the temple doors ä	swing open and the procession of black-clad figures ä	file out into the street. Instinctively you take hold ä	of Karvas by the arm and pull him back into the ruins ä	to avoid being seen by the emerging soldiers. As they ä	pass by, you peer around the edge of the mouldering ä	warehouse doorway to watch them. A strange feeling of ä	unease makes the skin on the back of your neck ä	prickle, and immediately you sense that all is not ä	what it seems. When you magnify your vision to take a ä	closer look at the passing figures, you gasp with 
	shock at what you see.
