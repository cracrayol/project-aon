	You hurry past the gate guards and through the open ä	archway into a flagstoned concourse. 
	
	You are about to enter a seemingly empty avenue which ä	bisects the city's west quarter, when a armed soldier ä	suddenly appears from out of a darkened doorway. He ä	raises his spear and commands you to halt.
	
	
	If you wish to obey the soldier's command, turn to  ä	‚325‚

	If you choose to ignore his order, you can attempt to ä	escape by running away. Turn to  ‚82‚

	As the soldier approaches you realise that he is only ä	aware of Prince Karvas. You have not been seen; the ä	darkness, and your innate Kai camouflage skills have ä	kept you hidden from sight. Silently you sidestep ä	into the shallow archway of an adjacent house and ä	unsheathe your Kai weapon. Karvas stands in the ä	avenue, his eyes fixed on the approaching guard so as ä	not to betray your presence. Nervously the soldier ä	approaches the prince with his spear levelled at his ä	chest. He commands Karvas to state the name of his ä	regiment, and when he deigns to reply, your sixth ä	sense suddenly warns you that the guard is about to ä	raise the alarm.  
	
	Like an attacking panther, you leap from the shadowy ä	arch and strike the guard at the base of the neck ä	with the hilt of your weapon. Without uttering a ä	sound he crumples at the knees and falls unconscious ä	to the ground. Quickly you and Karvas drag his body ä	away from the avenue and hide it in a alleyway. ä	Before you leave, you make a quick search of the ä	soldier's pockets and backpack and discover the ä	following items:

	30 Ren (equivalent to 3 Gold Crowns)
	Spear
	Sword
	Dagger
	Bottle of Rice Wine
	1 Meal
	Ivory Comb

	If you wish to keep any of these items, adjust your ä	ÈAction ChartÈ accordingly.

	You hurry away from the alley and continue along the ä	avenue, past grimy two-storied houses of carved ä	hardwood that are silent behind their bolts and ä	shutters. It leads to a stone bridge that traverses ä	the River Tehda and then continues into the heart of ä	the east quarter. Here you almost collide with a ä	patrol of armed guards who are marching towards the ä	river, and hurriedly you are forced to take cover in ä	a timberyard to avoid being seen. You observe the ä	ten-strong patrol as it marches past. These men are ä	clad in black quilted tunics and wide silk leggings, ä	and they are armed with curved swords and hand-axes. ä	All are almond-eyed and they have shiny black hair ä	that is tied in a knot at the nape of their necks. ä	Their leader, a stocky bull-necked sergeant, wears ä	the emblem of Sejanoz emblazoned upon a scarlet arm ä	band. Patiently you wait for them to reach the ä	bridge, but as they do so another patrol comes ä	marching along the avenue from the opposite ä	direction. The east quarter of Bakhasa is a busy ä	place even at this late hour. Rather than risk being ä	seen and captured, you decide to remain hidden in the ä	timberyard and attempt to get a few hours sleep ä	before dawn.

	Unless you possess the discipline of Grand Hunt-ä	mastery, you must now eat a Meal or lose 3 ENDURANCE ä	points.
