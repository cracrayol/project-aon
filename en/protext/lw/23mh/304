	Beyond the arch is a narrow brick walkway which Š	borders the river. You hurry along this unlit Š	footpath until you come to a flight of steps that Š	lead to a flagstoned loading area crowded with Š	soldiers and wagons. By keeping low and moving from Š	one wagon to the next, you and Karvas are able to Š	cross this concourse undetected. 
	
	Soon you come to a stone bridge that traverses the Š	River Tehda. You hurry across and enter a wide avenue Š	which leads to the city's east quarter. Grimy two-Š	storied houses of carved hardwood pass by on either Š	side, silent behind their bolts and shutters. At the Š	end of the avenue you almost collide with a patrol of Š	armed guards who are marching towards the river, and Š	hurriedly you are forced to take cover in a Š	timberyard to avoid being seen. You watch the ten-Š	strong patrol as it marches past, and note that these Š	men are clad in black quilted tunics with wide silk Š	leggings, and they are armed with curved swords and Š	hand-axes. They are almond-eyed and they all have Š	shiny black hair that is tied in a knot at the nape Š	of their necks. Their leader, a stocky bull-necked Š	sergeant, wears the emblem of Sejanoz emblazoned upon Š	a scarlet arm band. Patiently you wait for them to Š	reach the river, but when they do, you see another Š	patrol come marching along the avenue from the Š	opposite direction. The east quarter of Bakhasa is a Š	busy place, even at this late hour. Rather than risk Š	being seen and captured, you decide to remain hidden Š	here in the timberyard and attempt to get a few hours Š	sleep before dawn.

	Unless you possess the discipline of Grand Hunt-Š	mastery, you must now eat a Meal or lose 3 ENDURANCE Š	points.
