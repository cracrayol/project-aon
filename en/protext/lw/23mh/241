	The tavern-keeper looks at the Ren with a mixture of ä	suspicion and disdain. "Bah, lousy Bakhasian ä	coinage," he spits, and he takes away the frothing ä	tankards and places them under the counter. 
	
	"I'll not accept Ren in my tavern. There's some in ä	this town that do, but I'll touch nothing that comes ä	from Bhanar since my son, Foulse, was murdered last ä	year in Bakhasa." The tavern-keeper looks to the ä	garrison soldiers seated at the table and indicates, ä	with a jerk of his thumb towards the door, that he ä	wants them to throw you out. 
	
	"That won't be necessary," says Karvas, and he tugs ä	at your sleeve. "We'll leave of our own accord."

	You abandon the Ren (erase these from your ÈAction ä	ChartÈ) and return to your horses. You are ä	disappointed that you have not been able to slake ä	your thirst, but you are also mindful that you still ä	have many miles to travel before you reach Seroa.
