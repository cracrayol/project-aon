	With a sneer on his face, the man snatches his hand Š	away. He then raises his empty pipe and waves it in Š	the air above his head. He is signalling to someone Š	behind you, and when you turn to look, you see eight Š	grim-faced mercenary knights emerging from hiding Š	places at the entrance to the bridge. They unsheathe Š	their weapons as they swagger towards the middle of Š	the bridge.

	"We've got ourselves a pair of troublemakers" shouts Š	the man with the pipe to his confederates as they Š	draw closer. "They say they won't pay us the toll."
	You sense that these robber knights cannot be Š	reasoned with. All they are interested in is taking Š	your money and your horses. Karvas draws his sword Š	and you unsheathe your Kai weapon in readiness to do Š	battle as these ruthless robbers quicken their pace.
