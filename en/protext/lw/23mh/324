	You and Karvas step over the lifeless bodies of the ä	knight and his escort, and hurry out into the ä	corridor beyond. You slam the cell door shut behind ä	you and, with a powerful kick of your heel, you ä	cleave away the dial of the lock to prevent the door ä	from being opened easily.
	
	Once outside, you notice the door to another cell ä	directly opposite and instantly your Kai sixth sense ä	alerts you to the presence of your weapons and ä	equipment. They are being stored in this adjacent ä	cell and you pause for a few moments to work on its ä	tumbler lock. This time your efforts are rewarded. ä	The lock disengages and, when you pull open the door, ä	you discover all of your confiscated weapons lying on ä	the floor of this cell. (You may erase the asterisks ä	[*] from your ÈAction ChartÈ now that your arms and ä	equipment have been restored.)

	In addition to your equipment you also discover ä	Prince Karvas's sword and belt, together with the ä	following:

	1 Bow
	3 Arrows
	Enough food for 1 Meal

	Karvas buckles on his swordbelt and before you leave, ä	he unhooks a coil of rope from the wall and slings it ä	over his shoulder. On returning to the corridor, you ä	hurry to the end to where a circular stone staircase ä	ascends to the levels above. With your Kai Weapon ä	back in your hand once more, you begin to climb the ä	steps, retracing the route that you committed to your ä	memory when you were dragged to your cell more than ä	an hour ago.
