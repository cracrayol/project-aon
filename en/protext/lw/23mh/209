	You reach to your pouch, remove 2 Gold Crowns, and ä	offer the coins to the blacksmith. He reaches out to ä	take them but then he hesitates and quickly withdraws ä	his hand. He is having serious doubts about selling ä	what he knows of Prince Karvas.
	
	Pick a number from the ÈRandom Number TableÈ (0 = ä	zero). For every Gold Crown that you are willing to ä	give the blacksmith, in addition to the 2 you have ä	already offered him, you may add 1 to the number you ä	have chosen.

	If it is ‚8‚ or higher, turn to  ‚347‚
