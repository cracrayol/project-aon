	You return to the jetty and show your tickets to the Š	ticket seller. He grunts his approval and waves you Š	aboard the riverboat. The number of your berth is Š	written on your ticket, and you discover that you are Š	both sharing cabin number 12 which is located at the Š	stern. You are pleased to discover that it is one of Š	the better cabins aboard. It has a cupboard stocked Š	with food and wine, a washing bowl and jug of water, Š	and twin bunk beds with mattresses and feather Š	pillows. 
	
	After a short while you hear the clang of the Š	riverboat's bell. It is a signal that the boat is Š	about to set off for Seroa in fifteen minutes' time Š	and a last call for passengers who are still in Xaia. Š	Through the porthole of your cabin you can see the Š	jetty and a queue of people boarding the boat. 
	Fortunately, you do not see any Cavalians among them. 
	
	Once everyone is aboard, the gangplank is raised and Š	the riverboat's waterwheel begins to turn. As the Š	boat gets underway, you lock the cabin door and Š	settle down to a good night's sleep.
