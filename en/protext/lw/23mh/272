	While you are enjoying your ale, you watch the Š	garrison soldiers playing cards at the nearby table. Š	After a few minutes, your Magnakai discipline of Š	Animal Control informs you that the parrot that is Š	perched in the rafters above is helping one of the Š	soldiers to win. Its tuneful squawking is a secret Š	code that tells him when his comrades are bluffing. Š	Mentally you command the parrot to be silent and Š	immediately it obeys you, to the bitter regret of the Š	cheating soldier who promptly loses all of his ill-Š	gotten gains.

	Having finished your ales, you and Karvas leave the Š	tavern and return outside to your horses.

	If you decide to depart without further delay, turn Š	to  â230â
