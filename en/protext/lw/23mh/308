	Wizard Acraban and Lord Zinair are already waiting ä	aboard the ÈStarstriderÈ by the time you reach the ä	market square. The magician orders the boarding cage ä	to be lowered and you are winched up to the skyship. ä	Both are anxious to hear your news of Prince Karvas's ä	whereabouts for their own enquiries have yielded ä	little useful information. You inform them of what ä	you have learned - that the prince has a wife and ä	they are living somewhere on the island's northern ä	coastline. Lord Zinair has discovered that Amarelda ä	is the name of Karvas's wife, and Acraban has learned ä	that they last visited Mydnight a year ago.
	
	"You have done well, Grand Master," says Lord Zinair. ä	"The citizens of this city are a secretive breed, yet ä	you may have prised enough from them to help us find ä	our reclusive Siyenese prince." Turning to Acraban, ä	he says: "I propose we travel north at first light ä	and commence a search of the northern shoreline. It ä	will be easier to espy his retreat from the air than ä	to attempt a search by land." 

	Acraban nods in agreement and passes word to his ä	young crew to prepare the ÈStarstriderÈ for a voyage ä	north at first light.
