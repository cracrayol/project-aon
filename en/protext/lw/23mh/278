	You draw an arrow from your quiver, take aim, and Š	fire in one smooth seemless movement. Your shaft Š	speeds towards the leading hunter and burrows deep Š	into his chest, knocking him clean out of his saddle. Š	Upon seeing his comrade fall, the other hunter tugs Š	hard on his horses's reins and turns him around to Š	gallop back to the others. Rather than risk having to Š	face them all, you decide that now would be a good Š	time to leave. You motion to Karvas and he follows as Š	you thread your way through the trees to the far side Š	of the hillock. As soon as you are clear, you race Š	away together as fast as your horses will carry you.

	You are more than two miles from the hillock when you 
	bring your panting steeds to a halt and look back. Š	You see the fanji herd have been scattered by the Š	hunters and they are running in all directions. The Š	hunters show no interest in pursuing you; their only Š	concern appears to be slaying of as many fanji as Š	possible. The sight of this wanton slaughter raises Š	your ire, but you quell your anger and ride on with Š	Karvas through the tall grass, back towards the Š	trail.
