	You urge your horse to the gallop and steer him Š	across the grassy plain towards a distant farmstead.
	But soon your young mount begins to tire and lose Š	speed. Karvas, too, is having difficulty with his Š	horse and he cannot keep up the pace. Steadily the Š	hunters close the gap between you. When they are less Š	than one hundred yards distant, you see their leader Š	place a horn to his mouth and you hear a shrill and Š	piercing tone echoing across the plain. Pressure Š	builds in your head and sharp stabbing pains burn at Š	your temples. You glance over your shoulder and see Š	that Prince Karvas and his horse are both suffering Š	badly from the insidious sound of the hunter's horn.
