	Hurriedly you retrieve the seal from your backpack Š	and thrust it before the Inquisitor-Major's face. The Š	man blanches when he recognises the object you hold Š	and immediately he stops blowing his horn.
	
	"Please, please accept my apology," he begs, his Š	voice suddenly dripping with fear. "I did not know Š	that you were travelling with the Baron's seal. Your Š	mission must be of great importance. I...I trust I Š	have not caused you too great a discomfort. I am Š	truly sorry."

	WIthout saying a word, you return the seal to your Š	backpack and watch as the Inquisitor-Major and his Š	hunting party make a hasty departure. As they gallop Š	away across the plain towards the distant foothills, Š	you use your Kai curing skills to revive Prince Š	Karvas fully before you continue your ride east Š	towards Varedo.
