	You leave the jetty and hurry to the tavern. This Š	riverside inn is in urgent need of some paint and Š	repair, yet for all its shabby outward appearance, Š	its taproom is filled to overflowing with customers. Š	The sound of lyre and pipe music mingles with the Š	chatter and raucous laughter of its patrons, many of Š	whom are river travellers bound for Seroa within the Š	hour. You push you way through the noisy crowd and Š	climb a flight of stairs that gives access to rooms Š	on the upper floor. From the top of the stairs you Š	are able to get a better view of the crowded bar Š	room. Karvas points out two men who are standing at Š	the tavern counter. They are dressed in dandified Š	court costumes and they wear Sadando's eagle's-head Š	emblem pinned to velvet berets that are resting on Š	their coiffured heads. "I'd wager those two dandies Š	have tickets for the riverboat," says Karvas, Š	conspiratorially. You focus your concentration on the Š	two men and your Kai sixth sense confirms that the Š	prince's assumption is correct.


	If you wish to approach them and offer to buy their Š	riverboat tickets, turn to  â17â
	
	If you wish to wait outside the tavern and approach Š	the men when they leave, turn to  â111â
