	You cross the narrow village street and approach the Š	two Cavalian lordlings as they stroll leisurely Š	towards the jetty.
	"Good evening, my Lords," says Karvas, politely.
	"My friend and I were wondering if you two gentlemen Š	would care to sell us your tickets for the riverboat Š	to Seroa?"
	The taller man utters a terse laugh and he flicks his Š	fingers at Karvas dismissively. "We've waited many Š	years for Baron Sadanzo to come to power and we do Š	not intend to miss his crowning."
	"T'is so" whines his stout companion. "We have no Š	tickets to sell and we are fast growing tired of your Š	impudence. Begone, you fellows. Leave us be."
