	It is early in the afternoon when you see the ruins ä	of an ancient fortress. They lie less than a mile ä	from the trail, on a plateau of rock at the base of a ä	shallow ravine. As you descend the trail and come ä	closer to the ruins, you hear a distant rumble of ä	thunder. Within minutes it has begun to rain and soon ä	you find yourself caught in a torrential downpour. ä	Your Kai pathsmanship skills warn you that heavy rain ä	in these barren mountains brings with it the danger ä	of a sudden flash flood.			

	The sheeting rain is making it impossible to see the ä	trail ahead. Rather than continue and risk flood or ä	fall, you leave the trail to seek shelter in the ä	ruined fortress.
