	The lightning bolt struck the skyship's hull directly ä	below the helm, rendering you unconscious as the ä	concussive force of the blast was transmitted through ä	the deck (lose 5 ENDURANCE points).

	On regaining consciousness you discover that the ä	ÈStarstriderÈ is now more than five miles clear of the ä	fissures. As slowly your vision clears you see that ä	Acraban has taken control of the wheel. He smiles ä	when he sees that you are still alive. You notice ä	that he looks gaunt and exhausted, and his ginger ä	hair is matted with grime and sweat. Clearly his ä	efforts to repair the ailing skyship have severely ä	drained his magical energies. As you stagger to the ä	helm you sense that the steering has become more ä	erratic. The ÈStarstriderÈ has lost altitude and her ä	deck is starting to tilt alarmingly to starboard. ä	Soon it becomes almost impossible to stand upright. 

	"We have lost one stabiliser and the other is badly ä	damaged," says Acraban, grimly. "I have done all I ä	can to repair it but I fear it will fail us at any ä	moment. Without stabilisers we cannot stay airborne."
	
	Acraban orders his crew to prepare for a crash ä	landing. Some of the young men tie themselves to the ä	ship's mainmast, whilst others brace themselves ä	against the rails and place their fate in the hands ä	of the Goddess Ishir. Prince Karvas has found refuge ä	in a rope locker which is bolted to the main deck. He ä	lifts the lid and calls out to you to join him for ä	there is sufficient space for two inside.


	If you wish to climb into the rope locker alongside ä	Prince Karvas, turn to  ‚79‚

	If you choose to stay with Acraban at the ship's ä	helm, turn to  ‚199‚
