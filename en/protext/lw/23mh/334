	You queue for over three hours before eventually you Š	reach the clerk's window. When you ask the mousey-Š	looking man if he knows where you can find Prince Š	Karvas of Siyen he shakes his head. Irritably he Š	stabs an ink-stained finger in the direction of the Š	Reeve-sergeant's table, over on the far side of the Š	hall.

	"You should ask Sergeant Hozla that question. I only Š	change money here. If you have nothing to exchange Š	then move on and let the next man step forward to the Š	window."
	

	If you wish to take the clerk's advice, you may join Š	the queue for the Reeve-sergeant's table by turning Š	to  â127â

	If you choose to exchange some of your Gold Crowns Š	for Torqs, the linen currency of Sheasu, then turn Š	instead to  â74â
