	You cross the narrow village street and approach the ä	two Cavalian lordlings as they stroll leisurely ä	towards the jetty. "Good evening, my lords. We meet ä	again," says Karvas, in a deep and menacing tone. 
	"My friend and I still wish to acquire your tickets. ä	Kindly hand them over." The prince pulls his sword a ä	few inches from its scabbard to reinforce his demand.

	Normally these two fops would blanch and faint in the ä	face of such a threat, but a night spent drinking at ä	the tavern has filled them with liquid courage. The ä	taller man stares Karvas defiantly in the eye and ä	then he begins to shout at the top of his voice: ä	"Robbers! Footpads! Cut-throats!"

	Karvas reacts instinctively. He punches the dandy ä	squarely on the jaw and leaves him sprawled ä	unconscious on the ground. His stout companion ä	freezes and his mouth opens wide with shock. Before ä	he, too, can scream out in alarm, you knock him out ä	with a sharp blow to the nape of his neck.
	
	Quickly you drag their bodies into the alleyway and ä	rifle their pockets in a search for their tickets. ä	Karvas finds both of them in the jacket pocket of the ä	stout lordling, and he hands one to you. (Record the ä	Riverboat Ticket on your ÈAction ChartÈ as a Special ä	Item which you keep in the pocket of your breeches. ä	You need not discard another item in its favour if ä	you already possess the maximum number of Special ä	Items permissible)

	Having now obtained what you need, you leave the ä	alleyway and hurry back to the jetty.
