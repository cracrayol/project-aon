	For two frustrating days and nights the ferocious Š	storm continues unabated. Floods and mudslides render Š	the mountain trail impassable, and you are unable to Š	leave the shelter of the ancient keep until early on Š	the morning of the third day. Anxious to make up for Š	lost time, you depart as soon as the rains cease. 
	
	A further two days are spent riding the treacherous Š	trail. It takes you across the northern foothills of Š	the Dammerdons to the Lunarlian settlement of Jaroc. Š	It is mid-morning, fifteen days before Harvestmas, Š	when finally you enter the palisade wall of this Š	sprawling border town. Few of the people you find Š	here are natives. Most are nomadic horsemen from the Š	Great Lunarlian Plain who have come to barter and Š	trade their wares at its famous tented market. As you Š	ride through the bustling market place, you pause for Š	a few moments to observe a quarrel between a trader Š	and a nomad. The nomad is accusing the trader of Š	selling him some rotten food, and he demands the Š	return of his money. The trader refuses. In Š	desperation, the nomad turns to you and holds out his Š	purchase at arm's length.
	
	"Stranger, would y'say this meat is fit to eat ?" he Š	pleads, inviting you to inspect an unappetising Š	haunch of maggoty meat.
