	The riverboat fare to Seroa is normally 20 Orla (10 Š	Gold Crowns) per person. Karvas offers the ticket Š	seller the pouch of 50 Orla that Sainus gave him, Š	together with your horses. A flicker of interest Š	lights up the man's insipid eyes, but then he shakes Š	his head solemnly and dismisses the prince's generous Š	bribe. You sense that he is holding out in the hope Š	that you will increase your offer.


	If you wish to offer the ticket seller some of your Š	money, in addition to the Orla and horses that Karvas Š	has already proposed, turn to  â89â

	If you do not wish to increase the size of the bribe, Š	you can leave the jetty and go in search of tickets Š	at the riverside tavern by turning to  â256â
