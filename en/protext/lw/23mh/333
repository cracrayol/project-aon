	Confident in your natural agility, you descend the Š	rough stone wall until you are able to lower the Š	buckle-end of your belt to within reach of the Š	prince's free hand. The instant he grabs the buckle, Š	you assist him to climb back to the surface.	Gasping Š	for breath, you drag yourselves over the lip of the Š	cavity and collapse onto the cold stone floor of the Š	hall. When Karvas reaches over to shake you by the Š	hand, you happen by chance to notice that he has a Š	crescent-shaped birthmark on his right wrist. 
	Between gasps of breath, he thanks you earnestly for Š	your timely help. Had you not acted when you did he Š	feels certain that he would have lost his grip and Š	fallen into the raging river.
		
	It is only later, when you are re-threading your belt Š	through the loops in your tunic, that you discover Š	you have lost one item from your backpack. It fell Š	out during the rescue and was carried away by the Š	underground river.

	You may erase any one item of your choice from your Š	Backpack items list.
