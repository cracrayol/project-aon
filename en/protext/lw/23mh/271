	You are getting ready to leave the derelict warehouse Š	when the tower bell starts to toll. Minutes later a Š	long line of black-clad figures, mostly soldiers, Š	come filing along the street towards the building. Š	Two great doors swing open to receive this procession Š	and you catch a glimpse of the building's cavernous Š	interior. It is richly appointed with tapestries and Š	golden ornaments, yet, despite its beautifully Š	crafted opulence, you feel nothing but a sense of Š	revulsion. Your Kai sixth sense informs you that this Š	place is a temple wholly devoted to the worship of an Š	evil deity.

	As soon as the procession has entered, the doors are Š	closed and the bell ceases to toll. Shaken but Š	undeterred by what you have witnessed, you leave the Š	warehouse and hurry across the street towards the Š	base of the tower.
