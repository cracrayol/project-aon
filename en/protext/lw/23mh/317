	Baron Lodamos asks that you and Karvas accompany him Š	to the citadel's main hall. 
	"If you are to reach Seroa in time to foil Sadanzo, Š	you must set off without delay. The ascendence Š	ceremony will take place one week from today, and you Š	still have many miles to travel. Time is against you, Š	my lords, but I will do all I can to help your vital Š	mission."
