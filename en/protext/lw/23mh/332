	When consciousness returns and you prise open your Š	eyes, to your dismay you discover that you are lying Š	upon the straw-covered floor of a prison cell. Prince Š	Karvas is lying unconscious at your feet. Carefully Š	you raise his head and, by the use of your innate Kai Š	healing skills, you are able to coax him back to full Š	consciousness.

	Through the bars of a high cell window you can see Š	that night has fallen. The noise of raucous Š	celebration is being carried on the evening breeze, Š	and it is a sound that strikes a chill into your Š	heart, for it tells you that your mission has failed. Š	Sadanzo has been crowned King of Siyen, and in every Š	tavern throughout this capital his robber knights are Š	celebrating their leader's rise to power.

	The iron door clangs as its bolt is pulled. It creaks Š	open and a grim-faced gaoler throws your weapons and Š	equipment into the cell. "You're free to go," he Š	growls, "not that you're likely to be free for long 
	now that Sadanzo rules the roost." The gaoler turns Š	you and Karvas out onto the street, and as you walk Š	dejectedly away from the jail, you witness a band of Š	Sadanzo's robber knights looting houses and shops. Š	They pillage the homes and livelehoods of the Š	innocent in defiance of the city guard who are now Š	powerless to stop them.

	The sight makes Prince Karvas's blood boil and he Š	resolves to do something about it. "Come, Grand Š	Master," he says, excitedly, "we may still have one Š	chance left to triumph over Sadanzo. We must seek out Š	Phedros - the Marshal of the Realm."
