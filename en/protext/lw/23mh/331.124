	You pass the hours before daybreak in a restless, ä	semi-conscious state. You cannot sleep properly for ä	your mind is tormented by the gnawing fear that your ä	mission has come to an early and tragic end. You rise ä	before dawn and try to overcome your melancholic mood ä	by tending to the three wounded crew members. Through ä	the use of your Kai curing skills you are able to ä	accelerate their own natural healing processes so ä	that, when daybreak finally arrives, they are no ä	longer incapacitated by the injuries they received in ä	the crash.

	As grey morning light filters down through the canopy ä	of the forest, it reveals a corridor of smashed and ä	flattened trees lying in the wake of the crippled ä	ÈStarstriderÈ. Acraban and his bo'sun make a lengthy ä	inspection of the craft and then report their ä	findings. 

	"The glad news is that she's repairable," pipes ä	bo'sun Gora, confidently. "She looks bad but her ä	engine's as sound as a bell. We've the materials and ä	tools aboard to fix 'er stabilisers, and there's ä	mor'n enough timber 'round here to patch up the decks ä	and hull." Acraban nods his agreement yet, unlike his ä	bo'sun, his face remains dour.

	"Aye, she'll fly again," confirms Acraban, "but it'll ä	take us close to a month to craft the parts we need ä	to repair the stabilisers." He turns to Prince Karvas ä	and says: "Alas, my lord, by then it will be too late ä	to reach Seroa in time for your crowning."

	"What if we were to seek aid from the craftsmen of ä	Bakhasa?" you say, knowing by instinct and a brief ä	study of your map that this city can be no further ä	than a hundred miles away to the east. "Could the ä	repairs be made any sooner with their help?"

	"Expect no help from that quarter," replies Karvas, ä	coolly. "During my time in Mydnight I heard many ä	stories about Bakhasa and its ruler - the Imperial ä	Autarch Sejanoz. They were all chilling tales. They ä	say it's a cruel and evil place - a city without a ä	soul where human life counts for little. If you wish ä	to live to see your homeland again, master Acraban, ä	you should not seek the help of the Bakhasians. ä	Better by far to keep your work hidden from their ä	eyes."

	"But, my lord," replies Acraban, "what of your ä	kingdom?  Are you prepared to surrender your ä	birthright to Baron Sadanzo?"

	"No, never!" retorts Karvas, suddenly angered by the ä	wizard's suggestion. "There are twenty-one days yet ä	before the feast of Harvestmas. With the blessing of ä	the gods, I vow I shall be in Seroa on that day to ä	claim my ascedence." 
	
	The Prince proposes to set off for Seroa on foot. He ä	says that he will go alone and that you should stay ä	here to help Acraban restore the ÈStarstriderÈ, ä	returning with him to Sommerlund once the repairs are ä	complete. Politely you refuse his proposal. You have ä	vowed to Lone Wolf that you will carry out your ä	mission and, despite adversity, you will not abandon ä	your duty. It is a matter of Kai honour that you ä	should escort him to Seroa.

	The Prince smiles when you refuse to let him attempt ä	the long journey to Seroa alone. 

	"Very well, Grand Master," he says, "so be it. In ä	truth, I could not hope for a more worthy companion ä	on the road ahead. Come, let us plan our way as best ä	we can."

	Acraban has one of his men fetch his compass and ä	charts from the skyship to help you to determine the ä	swiftest route overland to Seroa. You quickly ä	establish your present location and suddenly you ä	realise how difficult the journey ahead will be. ä	Seroa lies over twelve hundred miles to the east, ä	beyond mountains, plains and uncharted wilderness. 
	You calculate that in order to reach the city in time ä	you must cover no less than sixty miles every day. 

	"On foot, across such harsh terrain...it is ä	impossible," says Acraban, shaking his head. "Perhaps ä	so," replies Karvas, "but if we had horses then it ä	could be done."

	You scan the surrounding forest and let your Kai ä	senses wander afar. "There are no horses in this ä	timberland, my lord" you say, certain in the ä	knowledge that your judgement is correct. Karvas ä	acknowledges your skill with a wry smile.

	"I take great pride in my magical powers," interjects ä	Acraban, jovially, "but even I, my lord, cannot ä	summon horses from out of the air. Where, pray tell, ä	do you hope to find mounts with strength enough to ä	carry you all the way home?"
	
	Karvas turns his eyes to the east and says: "Why, in  ä	Bakhasa of course. Mark you, the citizens of that ä	fell city will not help us out of the goodness of ä	their hearts, of that we can be sure. But they have ä	horses - strong Bhanarian stallions. Perhaps, Grand ä	Master, we shall be able to borrow a pair?" 

	You laugh with Prince Karvas at the audacity of his ä	plan and you feel your spirits rise. A long and ä	dangerous journey lies ahead, yet you are impressed ä	by the Prince's courage and determination and you ä	feel confident once more that your mission can ä	succeed. Acraban approves also. He and his men will ä	stay and restore the ÈStarstriderÈ and then fly back to ä	Toran as soon as they are able.

	Mindful that time is not your ally, you gather your ä	weapons and equipment together in readiness to leave. ä	After bidding farewell to Acraban and his crewmen, ä	you set off with Prince Karvas into the great forest, ä	heading east. The vast timberland is rich with game, ä	roots, and berries, and you are able to hunt and ä	gather food on the move (you gather enough for 2 ä	Meals). By noon you have made good progress and have ä	reached the eastern fringe of the forest. Beyond lies ä	an undulating plain that gradually descends towards a ä	wide river. To the north-east, sitting astride this ä	river, you glimpse the dark outline of a city. 
	
	"That's Bakhasa," says Karvas, confidently. You ä	magnify your vision and estimate it to be no more ä	than fifty miles distant. "With luck, we should make ä	it there by midnight."
