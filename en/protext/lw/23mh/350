	Congratulations Grand Master. Your mission is Š	complete. In the face of great adversity you have met Š	the challenge and you have triumphed. You have upheld Š	the highest traditions of the Kai with honour and Š	dignity, and you have displayed exceptional strength Š	and bravery throughout your ordeal. The succession of Š	Karvas is an important victory in the war against Š	Evil, for it has prevented the throne of Siyen, 
	Sommerlund's richest ally, from falling into the Š	hands of an agent of Naar. You have earned the Š	respect of the Siyenese people and they will never Š	forget the debt of gratitude they owe you.
	
	Following the celebration of his succession, King Š	Karvas arranges for you to return home to Sommerlund Š	by sea aboard his royal caravel. The voyage is swift Š	and uneventful, yet upon reaching Holmgard you learn Š	of a new and deadly threat that has arisen to Š	challenge the Kai. If you wish to confront this Š	threat, the nature of the challenge will be revealed Š	in the next exciting Lone Wolf adventure, entitled: Š	RUNE WAR
