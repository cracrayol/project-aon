	Your advanced discipline reveals to you that the Š	fanji are not migrating at all; they are fleeing for Š	their lives. You magnify your vision and glimpse a Š	number of horsemen who are galloping with the herd. Š	They are picking off the best specimens at close Š	quarters with their bows and spears. The leading Š	fanji are constantly changing direction in an effort Š	to lead the rest of the herd away from these Š	merciless hunters. To your dismay, as the herd are Š	passing within a mile of the trail, you see the Š	leaders suddenly switch direction and come thundering Š	towards you and Karvas.

	With a frantic waving of your arm you signal to Š	Karvas to follow your lead. Then you veer away from Š	the trail, ahead of the onrushing herd, and gallop Š	through the waist-high grassland towards the banks of Š	the River Ioma.
