	The number of guards and the frequency of the patrols Š	make it too dangerous to attempt to gain entry to the Š	stables from the square, and so you decide to search Š	around the perimeter wall to see there is an easier Š	way. Karvas gets ready to move from behind the cart, Š	but you tell him to stay here and wait for your Š	signal. "Better I should go alone, my lord," you say. Š	"It will halve the risk of being seen. Wait here for Š	my signal and be prepared to act quickly when you see Š	it." The prince nods his agreement and he wishes you Š	good luck before you depart. 

	Using your Kai camouflage skills to keep yourself Š	hidden from the watchful guards, you scurry away from Š	the cart and skirt around the high perimeter wall. On Š	the west side of the compound you discover that the Š	wall is lower and the number of passing soldiers are Š	fewer and less frequent. You run to the base of the Š	wall and, as you look up at its spiked top, you Š	ponder the best way you can reach the other side.
