	Your leap across the burning tree has created a Š	temporary gap in the flames. Karvas is able to Š	exploit this by jumping his stallion at exactly the Š	same place. As they emerge from the flames, you cheer Š	his masterful display of horsemanship and beckon him Š	to follow as you gallop along the trail. Your Š	pursuers are not so daring. When they reach the Š	burning tree they halt and give up the chase, Š	allowing you and Karvas to make good your escape into Š	the foothills of the Dammerdon Mountains.
