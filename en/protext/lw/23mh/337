	Quickly you intone the words of the Old Kingdom ä	battle spell - ÈShieldÈ - and circle your right hand 
	behind your head. The spell materialises barely a ä	second before a speeding crossbow bolt hits it and is ä	deflected away from your back. Its buckled tip trails ä	a line of sparks as it skims across the flagstones ä	and embeds itself in the courtyard wall.
