	The air temperature begins to rise and you sense a Š	benign aura of tranquillity radiating from this Š	spirit. The ghostly knight lowers his broadsword and Š	bows at the waist; you have passed a great test and Š	clearly you have won its respect. Your sixth sense Š	tells you that it has looked into the depths of your Š	soul and it approves of what it has discovered there. 
	
	As the temperature approaches normal, the appirition Š	shrinks and its vapours are drawn back into the tomb. Š	You hear the bolts being pulled on the chapel door, Š	and then it bursts open and in rushes Baron Lodamos Š	with his Marshal and a dozen of his armed guards. He Š	sees Karvas lying on the floor and he pulls to a Š	halt. "Ah ha, just as I thought. Another of Sadanzo's Š	assassins." Then he notices you standing before the Š	tomb and a look of puzzlement creases his noble brow. Š	The Marshal of the Guard kneels beside Karvas and Š	touches his fingers to the side of his neck, seeking Š	a pulse. "He's alive, my liege," he says, Š	incredulously.
	"Then it's true," retorts the Baron, "He really is Š	our prince returned from exile. Quickly, Guntor, take Š	him to my chambers at once."
