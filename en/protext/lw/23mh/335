	You call upon your Magnakai discipline of Psi-screen  Š	to protect your mind from this psychic attack. The Š	pain in your head lessens, yet your protection does Š	not extend to Prince Karvas who is now on the verge Š	of unconsciousness. You sense that a psychic assault Š	this powerful, and at such close quarters, could Š	permanently paralyse or kill him outright within a Š	matter of seconds. 


	If you possess Bardsmanship, and have attained the Š	Kai rank of Kai Grand Sentinel, turn to  â81â

	If you do not possess these skills, or if you have Š	yet to attain the required level of Kai Mastery, turn Š	to  â25â
