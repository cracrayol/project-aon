	You climb out of the chamber and slam the trapdoor Š	shut. Then, using your Kai weapon, you cleave the Š	iron ring from the stone so that the trapdoor cannot Š	easily be opened. Karvas is having difficulty staying Š	awake and you volunteer to sit the first watch so Š	that he can rest. You spend your watch listening to Š	the rain beating on the slate roof and the desolate Š	sound of the wind whistling through the mountains. Š	When Karvas takes over, you pull your warm cloak Š	close around your shoulders and settle down on the Š	floor to sleep. Karvas wakes you shortly after Š	daybreak. You have slept for only three hours yet you Š	open your eyes feeling refreshed and alert (you may Š	restore 3 ENDURANCE points). 

	Before you leave the hut and resume your journey Š	along the trail, you must eat a Meal or lose 3 Š	ENDURANCE points (unless you possess the discipline Š	of Grand Huntmastery).
