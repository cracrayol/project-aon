	The final tumbler clicks into place and the door ä	creaks open a few inches. The corridor outside the ä	cell is unguarded, and you beckon Karvas to follow as ä	you push the door wide and leave. As you step out, 
	you see the door to the cell that contains your ä	weapons and equipment and you pause for a few moments ä	to work on its tumbler lock. Your efforts are quickly ä	rewarded and you discover all of your confiscated ä	weapons lying here on the floor. (You may erase the ä	asterisks [*] from your ÈAction ChartÈ to indicate that ä	your arms and equipment have been restored.)

	In addition to your equipment you also discover ä	Prince Karvas's sword and belt, together with the ä	following:

	1 Bow
	6 Arrows
	Enough food for 1 Meal
	1 Spear
	1 Axe

	Karvas buckles on his swordbelt and, before you ä	leave, he takes a coil of rope from a hook on the ä	wall and slings it over his shoulder. On returning to ä	the corridor, you hurry to the end to where a ä	circular stone staircase ascends to the levels above. ä	With Kai Weapon in hand you begin to climb the steps, ä	retracing the route that you committed to your memory ä	when you were brought to the cell less than an hour ä	ago.
