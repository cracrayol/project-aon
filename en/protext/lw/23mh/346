	You hand over all of your money (erase everything ä	from the belt pouch section of your ÈAction ChartÈ) 
	and the ticket seller pockets the coins with glee.
	"Where are our tickets?" demands Karvas, but the thin ä	man merely waves his hand disdainfully and retorts:
	"I told you, all tickets are sold. Just go aboard and ä	lie low with the cargo 'til tomorrow. Once she's ä	underway, you'll not be needing tickets. It's a ä	straight voyage down the river to Seroa. She'll not ä	stoppin' along the way."

	You hurry aboard the riverboat and make your way to ä	the cargo hold in the belly of the boat. Here you ä	make yourselves as comfortable as you can among the ä	bales of linen and flax stored here. After a short ä	while you hear the clang of the riverboat's bell. It ä	is a signal that she is about to set off for Seroa in ä	fifteen minutes' time, and a last call for passengers ä	who are still in Xaia. Once everyone is aboard, the ä	gangplank is raised and the riverboat's waterwheel ä	begins to turn. As you feel the boat getting ä	underway, you settle yourself down among the bales ä	and quickly drift off to sleep.
