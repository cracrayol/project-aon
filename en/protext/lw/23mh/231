	You climb the wall with little difficulty. As you ä	settle your feet securely between the spikes in ä	readiness to leap into the training field that lies ä	beyond, you see that there is a guard standing ä	directly below your position. Without a moment's ä	hesitation, you leap onto his back and bring him ä	crashing to the ground. He tries to shout out but a ä	sharp blow to the base of his skull renders him ä	unconscious before his cry has left his lips. ä	Instinctively you scan the perimeter of the field and ä	the buildings beyond in case you have been seen, but ä	there appear to be no other guards on duty. (If you ä	made use of a Rope during your climb you must now ä	erase it from your ÈAction ChartÈ. In your haste to ä	silence the guard you have left it behind, fixed to a ä	spike, and hanging down the far side of the wall).
