	You and Karvas step across the lifeless bodies of the ä	knight and his escort, and then hurry out into the ä	corridor beyond. You slam the cell door shut behind ä	you and, with a powerful kick of your heel, you ä	cleave away the dial of the lock to prevent the door ä	from being opened easily.

	Across the corridor you see the door to the cell that ä	contains your weapons and equipment, and you pause ä	for a few moments to work on its tumbler lock. Your ä	efforts are quickly rewarded and you discover all of ä	your confiscated weapons lying here on the floor. ä	(You may erase the asterisks [*] from your ÈAction ä	ChartÈ to indicate that your arms and equipment have ä	been restored.)

	In addition to your equipment you also discover ä	Prince Karvas's sword and belt, together with the ä	following:

	1 Bow
	6 Arrows
	Enough food for 1 Meal
	1 Spear
	1 Axe
	Karvas buckles on his swordbelt and, before you ä	leave, he unhooks a coil of rope from the wall and ä	slings it over his shoulder. On returning to the ä	corridor, you hurry to the end to where a circular ä	stone staircase ascends to the levels above. With Kai ä	Weapon in hand you begin to climb the steps, ä	retracing the route that you committed to memory when ä	you were dragged to the cell less than an hour ago.
