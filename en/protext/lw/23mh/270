	News of Karvas's return spreads like wildfire through Š	the capital. Hundreds of cheering citizens enter the Š	square and surround the platform on all sides, Š	weeping and shouting with joy that they are to be Š	spared the tyranny of Sadanzo's rule. With the Š	blessing of the gathered nobles, Marshal Phedros Š	proclaims Karvas the king of Siyen and he places the Š	State Crown upon his head. Gladly Karvas accepts his Š	birthright and he rises to receive the adulation of Š	the excited crowd. As gradually the cheering Š	subsides, he turns to you and bids you kneel before Š	him. You obey his command and Karvas unsheathes his Š	sword. He dabs its blade lightly upon your head and Š	smiles: "Arise, Sir Kai, for I proclaim that you are Š	now a Knight of Siyen."
	Loudly the crowd cheer, though not for their king. Š	This time their cheers are for the Kai Grand Master Š	of Sommerlund without whom their beloved prince would Š	never have claimed his throne. 
	
	You accompany King Karvas and his noble entourage to Š	the Royal Palace where the celebration of his Š	ascendence to the throne begins with a banquet, and Š	concludes with a procession of royal coaches that Š	visit every quarter of the city. The citizens of Š	Seroa shower their new king with flowers. They also Š	call for the swift execution of the traitor Sadanzo. Š	The following day you learn that Karvas has granted Š	his citizens their request for justice. Baron Sadanzo Š	is sentenced to death, the execution to be carried Š	out at noon in the Palace Square. Upon the platform Š	on which he sought to be crowned king, the Baron Š	loses his head to the executioner's axe.
