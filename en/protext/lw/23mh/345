	You draw an arrow to your bow and let it fly towards Š	the nearest shrine-bearer. The shaft buries itself in Š	his chest and the force of its impact knocks him to Š	the ground. As he releases his grip of the platform, Š	it tilts over and the tiger-head idol tumbles from Š	its wooden base. It hits the ground with a mighty Š	crash, breaks in two, and releases a whirling cone of Š	red flame from its hollow core that engulfs the Š	remaining bearers. In the blink of an eye the three Š	men are transformed into smouldering heaps of ash. 
	
	Cries of fear and outrage echo along the street as Š	the Bakhasian soldiers witness the death of their Š	comrades and the destruction of their unholy symbol. Š	Before they can gather themselves and give chase, you Š	and Karvas rush across the street and make a hasty Š	escape along the dark alleyway beyond.
