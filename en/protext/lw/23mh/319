	You are less than ten yards from the blazing trunk Š	when suddenly your horse refuses to jump. He dips his Š	head and veers away, sending you somersaulting from Š	the saddle to crash head first against the burning Š	trunk. The force of the impact snaps your neck and, Š	in a terrifying instant, you are swallowed up by Š	total darkness.
	
	Tragically, your life and your mission ends here.
