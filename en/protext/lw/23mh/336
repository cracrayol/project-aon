	Using the Brotherhood spell - ÈLevitationÈ - you rise ä	effortlessly to the top of the wall. You then counter ä	the effects of the spell and step between the spikes. ä	You are getting ready to leap down into the training ä	field that lies beyond the wall when suddenly you see ä	a guard standing directly below you. Instinctively, ä	you leap onto his back and force him to the ground. ä	He tries to shout out but a swift blow to the base of ä	his skull renders him unconscious before his cry has ä	left his lips. Immediately you scan the perimeter of ä	the field and the buildings beyond in case you have ä	been seen, but there appear to be no other guards on ä	duty. 


	If you wish to search the guard's pockets, turn 
	to  ‚246‚

	If you do not, turn to  ‚16‚
