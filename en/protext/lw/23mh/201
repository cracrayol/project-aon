	You fight hard to keep the ÈStarstriderÈ on a straight ä	and level course, yet, despite your best efforts, she ä	veers continually towards starboard. Now the effects of ä	the damaged stabiliser are making it almost impossible ä	for you to maintain control of the helm. You steel ä	yourself as the skyship drifts above the right-hand ä	fissure, directly into the path of the soaring energy ä	bolts. Desperately you pull the wheel hard about to ä	avoid a collision but it is already too late. A ä	powerful bolt strikes the hull	and a stunning flash of ä	white light obliterates your senses.

	Pick a number from the ÈRandom Number TableÈ.

	If it is  ‚6‚ or higher, turn to  ‚7‚
