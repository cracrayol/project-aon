	Your Kai sixth sense detects that a strong Š	concentration of evil lies beyond the door. Š	Forewarned, you approach the iron portal with caution Š	and inspect its lever more closely. Your Magnakai Š	discipline of Divination detects an aura of magic Š	around this lever, yet you are unable fathom its true Š	purpose. You suspect that it is likely to be some Š	kind of locking or holding spell.


	If you wish to pull the lever with your hand, turn 
	to  â49â

	If you wish to try to pull the lever without touching Š	it directly, turn to  â122â
