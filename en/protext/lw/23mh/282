	As you near the clearing, you leave the trail and Š	take cover among some bushes that fringe the  Š	treeline. For a few minutes you wait here and observe Š	the settlement for signs of life. You can see a log Š	cabin with a veranda, three small sheds, and a Š	picket-fenced enclosure containing goats and Š	chickens. When your senses detect no human presence, Š	you enter the clearing and signal to Acraban to Š	follow as you make your approach towards the cabin. 
	
	From the veranda you can see a second track which Š	descends steeply towards a sandy cove. You intensify Š	your vision and catch sight of a man on the beach who Š	is kneeling beside a stone-covered mound. He has Š	blond shoulder-length hair and he is dressed in Š	breeches and a jerkin made from tanned goat hides.
	From the descriptions given to you by Lord Zinair, Š	you feel sure that he must be Prince Karvas.
	
	Elated by your discovery, you motion Acraban to Š	follow as you leave the cabin and hurry down the Š	steep path towards the beach. You are within thirty Š	yards of the kneeling man when he hears you Š	approaching. He turns to face you and, in an instant, Š	he grabs a loaded crossbow that is lying beside him Š	on the sand and he aims it at your chest. 	


	If you wish to raise your hands to show the man that Š	you mean him no harm, turn to  â253â

	If you decide to dive for cover among the boulders Š	that lie on either side of the path, turn to  â85â
