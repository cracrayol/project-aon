	Karvas takes a scroll, one of many that are crammed Š	between the books that line the surrounding shelves, Š	and places it inside the empty safe. Then he takes a Š	tinderbox from his pocket and sets the scroll alight.
	You wait for a few minutes until all that remains of Š	the scroll is a layer of flaky ash, and then he slams Š	shut the door and spins its dial. Now, should Sadanzo Š	open his safe, he will find that his contract with Š	the Assassin's Guild has mysteriously combusted.
	
	Having completed the deception, you are both eager to Š	leave this evil library without delay. But as you are Š	approaching the arch which leads to the adjoining Š	chamber, you suddenly hear a noise which makes you Š	stop dead in your tracks.
