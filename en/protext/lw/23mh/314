	You draw upon your psychic Kai disciplines to block ä	the insidious effect that Sadanzo's gem is having ä	upon the minds of the Siyenese noblemen. Your attempt ä	to disrupt its power requires a great effort that ä	drains you of mental and physical strength.

	Pick a number from the ÈRandom Number TableÈ. If the ä	number you have chosen is odd (ie. 1,3,5,7,9), the ä	effort costs you 4 ENDURANCE points. If the number is ä	even (ie. 0,2,4,6,8), you are drained of 7 ENDURANCE ä	points. If you possess Kai-screen, you may reduce ä	your ENDURANCE point loss by 2.

	By creating a psychic block, you divert the energy of ä	the gem and turn it back on itself with a dramatic ä	consequence. Sadanzo screams with shock as the gem in ä	his hand suddenly crumbles and disintegrates to dust.
