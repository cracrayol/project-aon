	You are shaken by the sudden impact of hitting the ä	water, but swiftly you muster your senses and fight ä	to stay astride your horse. Prince Karvas and his ä	mount come crashing down nearby and, in a tangle of ä	flailing limbs, you are all swept away by the river's ä	irresistible current.

	You are sped along by the rushing water for more than ä	five miles before you reach a stretch of shallows at ä	a bend in the river. Here you are able to regain ä	control of your frightened horses and coax them ä	towards the bank. Bruised and bedraggled, you stagger ä	out of the water and collapse on the muddy shore, ä	gasping for breath. 
	
	When you fully recover, you find that you have lost 1 ä	Weapon and 1 Backpack Item during your ordeal in the ä	river. (Make the necessary adjustments to your ÈAction ä	ChartÈ - you may choose which weapon and backpack item ä	to erase).


	To leave the river and return to the trail, turn
