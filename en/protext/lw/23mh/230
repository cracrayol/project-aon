	Beyond the east gate of Battle Pass, the trail winds Š	down through craggy borderland towards the lush river Š	valley of the River Ioma, where an ocean of sun-Š	yellowed grasses sway languidly in the warm afternoon Š	breeze. This rolling vista has a graceful Š	tranquillity that reminds you of the Southlund Š	Marches of Southern Magnamund. It stirs fond memories Š	of childhood days in that distant province and Š	prompts an unexpected bout of homesickness that Š	dampens your spirits. Karvas, too, is feeling a Š	little melancholy. Yet his mood is not born out of a Š	longing for his homeland, but from a sense of loss. Š	You ask what ails him and, with some reluctance, he Š	tells you:
	"The beauty of this valley belies its bloody past," Š	he says, and he sweeps his arm across the distant Š	horizon. "Many of my ancestors and countrymen have Š	fought and died here in battle. For the Siyenese it Š	is a land filled with proud and bitter memories."
	He points to a distant spire of rock and, when you Š	magnify your vision, you see that its grey granite Š	surface is too smooth and symmetrical for it to be a Š	natural feature of this rolling plain. 
	"There stands the Oridon Stone," he says. "It marks Š	the graves of ten thousand men who fell at the battle Š	of Inkil Reach".

	Prince Karvas regards the monolinth with a mixture of Š	sadness and pride, and you sense that quietly he Š	yearns to visit this battlefield marker.
	
	
	If you wish to leave the trail and ride with Karvas Š	to the Oridon Stone, turn to  â104â

	If you wish to dissuade the prince from visiting the Š	monolinth by reminding him of the urgent need for his Š	swift return to Seroa, turn to  â139â
