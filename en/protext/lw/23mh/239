	The barrel of oil explodes with a bright yellow flash ä	and the searing blast knocks you flat onto your back. 

	Pick a number from the ÈRandom Number TableÈ.

	If the number you have chosen is odd (ie. 1, 3, 5, 7, ä	or 9), reduce your current ENDURANCE score by ‚3‚.
	If the number is even (ie. 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8), reduce ä	your current ENDURANCE score by ‚5‚.

	Wincing from the stinging pain of your burns, you ä	pull yourself into a sitting position in time to see ä	a billowing mushroom of oily flame rising up into the ä	darkening sky above. Instinctively you draw upon your ä	Magnakai skill of Nexus to extinguish the fire at the ä	base of the mast and, as these tongues of flame ä	wither and die, Prince Karvas rushes forward to ä	smother the smoking remains with his journeyman's ä	cloak.
