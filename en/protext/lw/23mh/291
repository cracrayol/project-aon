	Using your mastery of Elementalism, you stir up the Š	dirt around the feet of the nearest shrine-bearer and Š	project this cloud of grit at his face. Instinctively Š	he releases his hold of the platform and cups his Š	hands to his stinging eyes. Without his support the Š	platform tilts over and the tiger-head idol tumbles Š	from its wooden base. It hits the cobblestones with a Š	mighty crash, shatters in two, and releases a Š	whirling cone of red flame from its hollow core that Š	engulfs the bearers. In the blink of an eye the four Š	men are transformed into smouldering heaps of ash. 
	
	Cries of fear and outrage echo along the street as Š	the Bakhasian soldiers witness the deaths of their Š	comrades and the destruction of their unholy symbol. Š	Before they can gather themselves and give chase, you Š	and Karvas rush across the street and make a hasty Š	escape along the dark alleyway beyond.
