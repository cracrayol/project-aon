	The smooth surface of the tower wall proves to be a Š	minor obstruction to someone of your ability and you Š	ascend effortlessly, like a spider, towards the Š	second storey window. On reaching the window you pull Š	yourself through the open frame and drop down onto Š	the steps of a stone stairway beyond. This circular Š	staircase leads to the top of the tower which Š	commands a magnificent view of the city. Aided by Š	your night vision, you are able to locate stables Š	less than a mile to the north of the tower. You Š	commit their location to memory and then hurriedly Š	you descend the stairs and return to the window. Once Š	more you use your climbing skills, this time to make Š	a speedy descent to the street below. 

	Prince Karvas is delighted to hear that there are Š	stables in the city, and he insists that you set off Š	for them at once. He is leading the way out of the Š	warehouse ruins when suddenly the tower bell begins Š	to toll once more. Moments later, the temple doors Š	swing open and the procession of black-clad figures Š	file out into the street. Instinctively you take hold Š	of Karvas by the arm and pull him back into the ruins Š	to avoid being seen by the emerging soldiers. As they Š	pass by, you peer around the edge of the mouldering Š	warehouse doorway to watch them. A strange feeling of Š	unease makes the skin on the back of your neck Š	prickle, and immediately you sense that all is not Š	what it seems. When you magnify your vision to take a Š	closer look at the passing figures, you gasp with 
	shock at what you see.
