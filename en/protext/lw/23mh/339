	You are stunned by the shock of impact upon hitting Š	the water and unable to avoid Prince Karvas and his Š	horse when they come crashing down on you from above. Š	The collision knocks you unconscious and your arms Š	become entangled with your horse's reins. As he 
       is drawn under by the strong current, you are dragged Š	with him to your doom at the bottom of this deep Š	river. Death is mercifully swift.

	Tragically, your life and your mission end here in Š	the murky depths of the River Ioma.
