	You utter the words of the Brotherhood spell - ä	ÈLightning HandÈ - and level your right arm towards the ä	creature's torso. An arc of electrical power leaps ä	from your hand and stabs the beast's chest, making it ä	shriek with pain, yet it does not deter it from ä	continuing its hungry advance towards your horses. As ä	is stalks closer, you see that it is drawing in great ä	gulps of air to inflate its chest. Its ribcage ä	expands and suddenly there is a sharp, popping sound. ä	You gasp with fear as dozens of horned spikes shoot ä	out of its skin and come hurtling towards you like a ä	volley of deadly darts.
	
	Pick a number from the ÈRandom Number TableÈ. If you ä	possess Grand Huntmastery, add ‚1‚ to the number you ä	have chosen.
