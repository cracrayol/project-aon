	The tavern-keeper looks at the two Gold Crowns and ä	smiles. "Ah, Northland coinage," he says, as he ä	examines them with an appraising eye, "and cast from ä	pure gold, unlike some that pass across this counter. ä	Rarely do I see coinage of this quality."

	The tavern-keeper is so impressed by the quality of ä	your crowns that he offers you 5 Lune for every 1 ä	Gold Crown you are willing to give him. If you wish ä	to exchange some of your Gold Crowns for Lune on ä	these favourable terms, make the appropriate ä	adjustments to your ÈAction ChartÈ.
