	Hastilly you recite the words of the Brotherhood ä	spell - ÈInvisible ShieldÈ - and sweep your hand in a ä	circle behind your head. The spell materialises ä	barely moments before a speeding crossbow bolt hits ä	it and is deflected away from your neck. Its buckled ä	point trails a line of sparks as it gouges a furrow ä	in the flagstones.
