	Confident in your natural agility, you descend the Š	rough stone wall until you are able to lower the Š	buckle-end of your belt within reach of the prince's Š	free hand. The instant he grabs the buckle, you Š	assist him to climb back to the surface.	Gasping for Š	breath, you drag yourselves over the lip of the Š	cavity and collapse onto the cold stone floor.
	When Karvas reaches over to shake you by the hand, Š	you happen by chance to notice that he has a Š	crescent-shaped birthmark on his right wrist. 
	Between gasps of breath, he thanks you earnestly for Š	your timely help. Had you not acted when you did he Š	feels certain that he would have lost his grip and Š	fallen into the raging river.
