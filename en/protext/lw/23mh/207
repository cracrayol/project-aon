	As the remaining rider presses home his attack, you Š	draw your Kai Weapon and get ready to strike as he Š	passes. Karvas sidesteps the tip of his weapon and Š	simultaneously you stab at the lancer as he gallops Š	his horse between you. His lance spins through the Š	air and you hear his plaintive death-cry as he Š	tumbles out of the saddle. As you glance over your Š	shoulder, you see him crash to the ground and roll Š	limply across the cobblestones. The citizens who Š	crowd this passageway cheer the lancer's demise and Š	some rush forward to pick his pockets and loot his Š	armour.
	
	You focus your Magnakai discipline of Animal Control Š	upon the two horses and you summon them to approach Š	yourself and Prince Karvas. Obediently they obey your Š	mental commands, and quickly you are able to mount Š	them and make good your escape from this passageway Š	into a wider street at its eastern end.
