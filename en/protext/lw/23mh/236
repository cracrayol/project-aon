	The Knight Bachelor recognises the linen curency of Š	Sheasu and a flicker of fear registers in the depths Š	of his cruel eyes. He glances at Karvas and then he Š	bellows a command to his men to move in and take you Š	both captive.

	Reluctantly you raise your hands. Better to surrender Š	to these horsemen and live to fight another day than Š	attempt to resist such overwhelming odds and place Š	the prince's life in peril.
