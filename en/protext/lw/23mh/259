	It is plain from the sight and noisome smell of the ä	haunch that this meat is rotten to the bone. Yet, 
	by drawing upon your advanced knowledge of ä	herbmastery, you are able to cause a seemingly ä	miraculous change to take place. You pull from your ä	pocket some roots and grasses that you have gathered ä	during your ride to Jaroc, and you rub them ä	vigorously into the offending meat. Within a matter ä	of seconds the meat is transformed into a condition ä	fit for human consumption. 

	The nomad looks at the haunch and his jaw drops open ä	in disbelief. The trader, grinning with delight, ä	promptly tells the nomad to stop complaining and go
	away. As he does so, the trader steps from behind his ä	stall and approaches you. Impressed by your skills, ä	he offers you the pick of any one item of food that ä	is laid out on his stall. 
	
	If you choose to accept his offer, you may add 1 Meal ä	to your ÈAction ChartÈ.
