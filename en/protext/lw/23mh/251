	You follow this ancient trail for more than an hour Š	as it ascends, by tortuous twist and turn, towards Š	the forbidding granite peaks of the Dammerdon Š	mountains. The air is now much cooler than when you Š	first entered the foothills, and the starlight that Š	has illuminated your way so far is fading fast. Your Š	Kai pathsmanship skills warn you that the time has Š	come to seek shelter for you sense a storm Š	approaching.

	You reach a plateau strewn with boulders where a Š	smaller track branches away from the main trail. It Š	leads to a large stone hut that stands perched upon a Š	spur of granite. Further along the trail you can see Š	a ledge of rock that overhangs a narrow gully.


	If you wish to seek shelter in the stone hut, turn 
	to  â84â

	If you choose to shelter beneath the rocky ledge, Š	turn to  â53â
