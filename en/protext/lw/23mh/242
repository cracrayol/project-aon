	You recite the words of the Brotherhood spell - ä	ÈLightning HandÈ - and extend your right arm towards
	the nearest shrine-bearer. A crackling arc of magical ä	energy leaps from your fingers and strikes the man 
	in the chest, knocking him to the ground. As he ä	releases his grip of the platform, it tilts over and ä	the tiger-head idol tumbles from its wooden base. It ä	hits the cobblestones with a mighty crash, breaks in ä	two, and releases a whirling cone of red flame from ä	its hollow core that engulfs the remaining bearers. ä	In the blink of an eye the three men are transformed ä	into smouldering heaps of ash. 
	
	Cries of fear and outrage echo along the street as ä	the Bakhasian soldiers witness the death of their ä	comrades and the destruction of their unholy symbol. ä	Before they can gather themselves and give chase, you ä	and Karvas rush across the street and make a hasty ä	escape along the dark alleyway beyond.
