	You draw upon your Magnakai discipline of Psi-screen Š	to protect your mind from these powerful pulses of Š	psychic energy. The physical pain of this attack Š	builds rapidly and you fear that your mental defences Š	will not prove strong enough to withstand the Š	terrific onslaught: lose 4 ENDURANCE points.
	
	If you have survived this mental wounding, you may Š	continue by turning to  â237â

	The pain fades as you feel your mental defences Š	strengthening and locking together to form an Š	impenetrable wall. The attacking pulses break like Š	waves smashing themselves against a rocky shore, and Š	then abruptly their energy dissipates and the attack Š	ceases.
