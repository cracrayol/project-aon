	You are within a few feet of the prince when suddenly Š	your fingers lose their purchase on the friable Š	rockface and you fall headlong towards the river. As Š	you plummet, you collide with Prince Karvas and Š	together you tumble into the raging waters, never to Š	be seen again.

	Tragically, your life and your mission come to a Š	watery end here, in the subterranean river beneath Š	the ancient ruins of Castle Dascallo.
