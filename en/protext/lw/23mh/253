	"Hail, Prince Karvas," you call, trying hard to make Š	your voice sound as unthreatening as you can. "You Š	have no need to fear us - we come as friends. We have Š	journeyed far to find you and we bring important news Š	from Siyen. Please, sire, put down your bow and let Š	us talk."

	The blond-haired man hesitates, and then he lowers Š	his crossbow just enough for you to be able to see Š	his face clearly. Now you are sure that he is the man Š	you seek. 
	
	"Who are you?" he shouts, "and what do you want from Š	me?"
