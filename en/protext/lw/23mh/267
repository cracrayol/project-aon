	You awaken shortly before noon and, with some ä	difficulty, you stir Karvas from a deep sleep. You ä	are both feeling refreshed after your rest, but there ä	are still more than one hundred miles to cover and ä	time is fast running out. You now have little more ä	than twenty-four hours to reach Seroa before the ä	crowning ceremony is set to take place.

	Fortunately, the weather is fair and you do not ä	encounter any unforeseen delays during your long ride ä	to the capital. During your journey, you recall Lone ä	Wolf's famous ride from Varetta to Casiorn that he ä	made six years earlier. He rode the magically-gifted ä	horse ÈWildwindÈ during his return home to Sommerlund ä	in time to break the siege of the Kai Monastery. Your ä	memory of his courageous feat inspires you to press ä	on. Your only regret is that you and Karvas do not ä	have ÈWildwindsÈ of your own.

	As night falls, your way ahead is guided by the light ä	of a waxing moon which glimmers brightly in a ä	cloudless sky. You forego rest and push your horses ä	hard, travelling all night to come within sight of ä	Seroa's southern wall and gatehouse by mid-morning. ä	As you approach the South Gate, you see that the ä	highway ahead is blocked by a long queue of ä	travellers who are waiting patiently to enter the ä	city. Prince Karvas is anxious to reach the gate as ä	quickly as possible, but he is also wary of going to ä	the front of this long queue. The Siyenese, and the ä	city's gate guards, to not take kindly to queue-ä	jumpers.


	If you wish to take your place at the rear of the ä	queue, turn to  ‚245‚

	If you decide to ride to the front of the queue and ä	attempt to gain entry to the city as quickly as you ä	can, turn to  ‚194‚
