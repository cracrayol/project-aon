	Beyond the arch there is a narrow brick walkway which Š	borders on the river. You hurry along this unlit Š	footpath until you come to a flight of stone steps.
	You are about to climb the steps when suddenly an Š	armed soldier appears from out of the shadows. He Š	raises his spear and commands you to halt.
	

	If you wish to attack this soldier, turn to  â115â

	If you decide to obey his command, turn to  â132â
