	You call upon your mastery of Old Kingdom magic and ä	utter the ancient power-word ÈGloar!È at the
	creature's torso. The concussive power of your word ä	batters against its chest, making it shriek with ä	pain, yet it does not deter it from continuing its ä	hungry advance towards your horses. As is stalks ä	closer, you see that it is drawing in great gulps of ä	air to inflate its chest. Its ribcage expands and ä	suddenly there is a sharp, popping sound. You gasp ä	with fear as dozens of horned spikes shoot out of its ä	skin and come hurtling towards you like a volley of ä	deadly darts.
	
	Pick a number from the ÈRandom Number TableÈ. If you ä	possess Grand Huntmastery, add ‚1‚ to the number you ä	have chosen.
	
	
	If your total score is ‚4‚  or less, turn to  ‚96‚
	
	If it is  ‚5‚  of more, turn to  ‚269‚
