	You close the safe and call upon your advanced Kai Š	Mastery to electrically charge the surface layer of Š	air that is in contact with its steel door. Karvas Š	watches you preparing this booby trap with a mix of Š	curiosity and fascination. You tell him that in Š	future, if any person or object should touch the Š	door, then the power will discharge itself with an Š	explosive force sufficient to destroy the safe and Š	ignite the surrounding books. Your explanation makes Š	Karvas smile. Clearly he relishes the thought of Š	Sadanzo falling foul of this trap at some later date.

	Your work done, you turn away from the safe and hurry Š	to leave this evil library. But as you approach the Š	arch which leads to the adjoining chamber, you Š	suddenly hear a noise which makes you stop dead in Š	your tracks.
