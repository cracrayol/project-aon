	You hurry past the gate guards and through the open Š	archway into a flagstoned concourse. By keeping low Š	and hiding in the shadows, you and Karvas are able to Š	cross this open plaza undetected and make your way Š	along an empty avenue which bisects the city's west Š	quarter. Grimy two-storied houses of carved hardwood Š	pass by on either side, silent behind their bolts and Š	shutters. 
	
	The avenue leads to a stone bridge that traverses the Š	River Tehda and then continues into the heart of the Š	east quarter. Here you almost collide with a patrol Š	of armed guards who are marching towards the river, Š	and hurriedly you are forced to take cover in a Š	timberyard to avoid being seen. You study the ten-Š	strong patrol as it marches past. These men are clad Š	in black quilted tunics and wide silk leggings, and Š	they are armed with curved swords and hand-axes. They Š	are almond-eyed and they all have shiny black hair Š	that is tied in a knot at the nape of their necks. Š	Their leader, a stocky bull-necked sergeant, wears Š	the emblem of Sejanoz emblazoned upon a scarlet arm Š	band. Patiently you wait for them to reach the Š	bridge, but as they do so another patrol comes Š	marching along the avenue from the opposite Š	direction. The east quarter of Bakhasa is a busy Š	place, even at this late hour. Rather than risk being Š	seen and captured, you decide to remain hidden here Š	in the timberyard and attempt to get a few hours Š	sleep before dawn.

	Unless you possess the discipline of Grand Hunt-Š	mastery, you must now eat a Meal or lose 3 ENDURANCE Š	points.
