	The horseman stops to stare out across the endless Š	rows of tree stumps. Slowly he shakes his head, then Š	he looks up at the darkening sky and you hear him Š	curse the failing light. In the distance, one of his Š	comrades shouts his name and beckons him to rejoin Š	the wagons. Begrudgingly he acknowledges the call. He Š	slams his sabre back into its steel scabbard and Š	returns to his horse. Patiently you watch him climb Š	into the saddle and ride away before you rise from Š	your hiding place and call for Prince Karvas to show Š	himself.

	Karvas rises from among the tree stumps and hurries Š	back to join you. Together you watch the departing Š	wagons and horsemen until they are no more than dots Š	on the horizon before you continue your trek towards Š	the city of Bakhasa.
	
	You are within twenty miles of Bakhasa when dusk begins Š	to darken the gloomy sky. Karvas requests that you stop Š	and rest awhile before making a final push for the Š	city. You are feeling hungry after your long day's Š	march and you readily agree. (Unless you possess the Š	discipline of Grand Huntmastery, you must now eat a Š	Meal or lose 3 ENDURANCE points.) 
		
	Night falls within an hour of you resuming your trek, Š	yet the distant lights of Bakhasa and its surrounding Š	settlements enable you to stay on course and maintain Š	an impressive pace. The city is lit by hundreds of Š	fiery beacons which mark the outline of its ancient Š	perimeter wall and angular watchtowers. These fires Š	also illuminate the surface of the River Tehda which Š	passes through the centre of Bakhasa. To the south of Š	the city, lines of tethered barges stacked high with Š	logs lie moored along both of its paved banks. Under Š	cover of the night, you are able to move through the Š	outlying settlements without being seen. When at last Š	you hear a bell in the city tolling the midnight hour, Š	you find yourself upon a knoll overlooking a rutted Š	road which approaches Bakhasa's west gate. Using your Š	night vision, you scan the high perimeter wall and note Š	the positions of guards posted around its tiled Š	parapet. They are greatest in number above a wide stone Š	archway where the glimmering river flows out of the Š	city. Prince Karvas is eager to enter the city before Š	dawn and he asks you to choose the way. Aware that it Š	may prove easier to find and take some horses whilst Š	most of Bakhasa's inhabitants are still asleep, you Š	scan the perimeter wall once more and consider how best Š	you can pass beyond it.
