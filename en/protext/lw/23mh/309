	Quietly you recite the words of the Brotherhood spell ä	- ÈMind CharmÈ - and focus the power of this spell upon ä	the two Cavalians. For all their pomp and grandeur ä	they are both weak-willed wastrels at heart, and ä	instantly they become compliant to your mental ä	command. You ask them to give their riverboat tickets ä	to you and Prince Karvas and dumbly they comply.
	
	(Record the Riverboat Ticket on your ÈAction ChartÈ as ä	a Special Item which you keep in the pocket of your ä	breeches. You need not discard another item in its ä	favour if you already possess the maximum number of ä	Special Items permissible)

	Having obtained what you require, mentally you ä	command the two fops to forget that they have ever ä	set eyes on you and Karvas. As they resume their ä	conversation, you and the prince slip away through ä	the crowd and leave the riverside tavern.
