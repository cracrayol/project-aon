	Desperately you attempt to dodge the tip of your Š	enemy's lance, but your reflexes have been dulled by Š	the shock of your fall and you react too slowly to Š	avoid being hit. The razor-sharp tip penetrates your Š	chest and punctures your heart, bringing a death that Š	is mercifully swift and painless.

	Tragically, your life and your mission end here on Š	the Bakhasa trail.
