	You look to the nearby barge, with its cargo of logs Š	strapped to its deck, and a bold plan forms in your Š	mind. Drawing upon your mastery of Elementalism, you Š	cause one of these canvas straps to ignite Š	spontaneously. Rapidly the fire burns through the Š	strap and, with a thunderous roar, five of the heavy Š	logs roll off the deck and splash into the river. Š	Sped along by the swift current, they ram into other Š	barges moored downstream and punch holes through Š	their hulls at the waterline. When the guards on the Š	parapet see one of the barges sinking, they raise the Š	alarm and muster a rescue party to attempt to save Š	its valuable cargo.   

	Under cover of the sudden commotion, you and Karvas Š	creep towards the river arch and pass beneath it Š	without being seen.
