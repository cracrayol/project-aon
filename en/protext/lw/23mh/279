	You skill and persistence pay off when you hear the Š	dull éclické that tells you that you have successfully Š	picked the lock. You twist the iron door handle and Š	push it open to reveal a circular stone staircase Š	which leads all the way to the bell chamber at the Š	top of the tower. Here you are treated to a spec-Š	tacular view of the city. Aided by your night vision, Š	you locate stables less than a mile to the north of Š	the tower. You commit their location to memory and Š	then hurriedly you descend the stairs to the Š	antechamber below.

	On your return to the warehouse, Prince Karvas is Š	delighted to hear that there are stables in the city Š	and he insists that you set off for them at once. He Š	is leading the way out of the ruins when suddenly the Š	tower bell begins to toll once more. Moments later, Š	the temple doors swing open and the procession of Š	black-clad figures file out into the street. Š	Instinctively you take hold of Karvas by the arm and Š	pull him back into the ruins to avoid being seen by Š	the emerging soldiers. As they pass by, you peer Š	around the edge of the mouldering warehouse doorway Š	to watch them. A strange feeling of unease makes the Š	skin on the back of your neck prickle, and Š	immediately you sense that all is not what it seems. Š	When you magnify your vision to take a closer look at Š	the passing figures, you gasp with 
	shock at what you see.
