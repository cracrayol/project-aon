	You launch a sharp pulse of psychic energy at the Š	Inquisitor-Major's mind which leaves him reeling Š	(deduct 1 ENDURANCE point for the use of this Š	discipline). He drops his accursed hunting horn and Š	lolls drunkenly in his saddle before the pain in his Š	mind dissolves and his senses return. He fears that Š	you are a powerful sorceror and, with a look of Š	abject terror in his eyes, he orders his hunting Š	party to return at once to the foothills. Blindly he Š	wheels his mount about, trampling and crushing his Š	horn beneath his horse's hooves in his desperation to Š	get away. 
	
	As the hunters gallop off across the plain, towards Š	the distant horizon, you use your Kai curing skills Š	to revive Prince Karvas fully before you continue Š	your ride east towards Varedo.
