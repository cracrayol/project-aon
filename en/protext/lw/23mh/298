	As you watch the migrating fanji, your sixth sense Š	warns you that something is wrong.	The leading beasts Š	are constantly changing direction and the rest of the Š	herd are following blindly in their wake. They are Š	passing within a mile of the trail when suddenly you Š	see the leaders switch direction once again. To your Š	dismay, you see they are now thundering towards the Š	trail on a collision course with yourself and Prince Š	Karvas.

	Frantically, you wave your arm and signal to Karvas Š	to follow your lead. With your heart pounding fit to Š	burst, you veer away and gallop your horse through Š	the waist-high grasses that borders the trail. As you Š	race before the thundering herd you can see only two Š	places ahead that promise safe sanctuary from this Š	stampede: the River Ioma, and a small tree-fringed Š	hillock.


	If you wish to head for the river, turn to  â114â

	If you choose to head for the hillock, turn to  â249â
