	As the ÈStarstriderÈ begins to descend there is a loud ä	explosion. From his nest atop the mainmast, the lookout ä	shouts out a warning and frantically he points towards ä	the ground. You rush to the rail and peer over the ä	side, your stomach churning with fearful anticipation ä	of what you will see. Deep within the fathomless ä	reaches of the fissures and chasms passing below, you ä	glimpse flashes of blue-white energy. These bolts are ä	growing brighter and louder as they streak towards the ä	surface. One bolt escapes from a vent in the middle ä	distance and rips open the sky. It skewers a cluster of ä	steam-clouds and blows them apart in a loud and ä	spectacular explosion of gas and flame. Once more you ä	urge Acraban to order his helmsman to ascend, this time ä	to avoid the new and deadly danger that is striking at ä	you from below. The wizard hesitates before turning to ä	Kuo, but before he can issue the counter-order, there ä	is a deafening ÈCrack!È from somewhere beneath the stern.
