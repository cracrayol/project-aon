	Hastilly you utter the words of Old Kingdom spell - 
	ÈShieldÈ - and make a circular motion with the palm of ä	your right hand. The shield of energy you create has ä	only partially formed when the dagger strikes, yet it ä	is sufficient to deflect it away from your chest.

	The guard gasps with shock and turns to run, but you 
	leap on him and drag him to the ground. In his blind ä	panic he is able to squirm from under you and ä	scramble to his feet. He tries to land a kick to your ä	chin but you turn his foot aside with your forearm ä	and it brushes harmlessly past your head. As he ä	struggles to regain his balance, you spring to your ä	feet and attack.
