	Karvas suggests that you use the rope he found in the ä	dungeon cell below. Taking one end, you tie a slip ä	knot and make it into a lasso. Then you cast the loop ä	of rope at the lever it the hope of catching it and ä	pulling it down. Your aim is true. Yet, upon the ä	instant that the rope touches the lever there is a ä	tremendous flash of yellow light, and a searing wave ä	of energy hits you in the chest and knocks you ä	backwards down the stairs.

	Pick a number from the ÈRandom Number TableÈ. If the ä	number you have chosen is even (ie. 0,2,4,6,8), ä	deduct 1 ENDURANCE point from your current total.
	If the number is odd (ie. 1,3,5,7,9), deduct 3 ä	ENDURANCE points.
