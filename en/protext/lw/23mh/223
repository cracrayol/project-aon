	You are leaving through the portal when the missile Š	strikes Karvas a glancing blow to his left shoulder Š	and sends him tumbling past you into an alleyway Š	outside the warehouse. You rush to his side and Š	hurriedly you staunch the flow of blood from his Š	injured shoulder by the use of your Magnakai Š	discipline of Curing. (Use of this skill to aid the Š	prince costs you 2 ENDURANCE points).
	
	With the Bakhasians close on your heels, you help the Š	prince to his feet and support him as you make a Š	hurried escape along the dark alleyway towards an Š	adjoining torchlit street.
