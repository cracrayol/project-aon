	When the prince recovers consciousness he can hardly Š	believe his eyes. The chill, spartan surroundings of Š	the chapel have somehow transformed into the warm, Š	rich opulence of Lodamos's personal chamber. The Š	fearsome ghost of Knight Ranald has disappeared, yet Š	he is now confronted by a sight he finds equally Š	difficult to reconcile: Baron Lodamos happily Š	conversing with you over a plate of roasted pheasant Š	and sweet potatoes!  The Baron, upon seeing that the Š	prince has regained consciousness, goes and kneels at Š	the side of his divan. Carefully he explains all that Š	has occurred since Karvas lost consciousness, and he Š	begs the prince to forgive him for the ordeal he has Š	been made to suffer. To redress his conduct, the Š	Baron pledges that he will do all he can to help you Š	both reach Seroa in time for the crowning ceremony on Š	Harvestmas Day.
