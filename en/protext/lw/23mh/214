	Your advanced tracking skills alert you to the Š	presence of a concealed pit which bisects the trail Š	ahead. It has been covered with pine branches and Š	camouflaged with a thin layer of earth and stones, so Š	as to make it indistinguishable from the rest of the Š	trail. Cautiously you approach this trap and, using Š	your Kai weapon, you lift away some of the branches. Š	Beneath you discover a deep pit lined with sharpened Š	stakes. 

	Carefully you and Acraban skirt around the edge of Š	this trap and then continue along the track towards Š	the clearing.
