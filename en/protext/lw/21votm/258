	The rogue whips a dagger from his belt and stabs it Š	into the table. He is gripping the handle so firmly Š	that his knuckles show white. Then he flicks a glance Š	at his companions and instantly they reach to their Š	swords. 

	"Hold your blades!" yells the innkeeper, as he comes Š	striding towards the table. You are half-expecting Š	him to throw these thugs out of the tavern, but Š	instead he comes straight at you and kicks the leg of Š	your chair with the heel of his boot. "You!" he Š	shouts, "get out!", and cocks his thumb towards the Š	door.
