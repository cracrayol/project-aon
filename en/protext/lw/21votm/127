	Captain Raker eagerly devours a hearty breakfast ä	which consists of black bread, cold chicken and ä	spiced mead. Between mouthfuls he tells you that his ä	orders are to take you to Bisutan after docking at ä	Barrakeesh to pick up Lord-lieutenant Fernant. He ä	believes that you are carrying state documents for ä	Fernant's eyes only. He has transported Kai ä	journeymen and messengers before and you are ä	satisfied that he does not suspect the true purpose ä	of your journey. 
	
	Raker is looking forward to completing the voyage. In ä	addition to the fee he has pocketed for your passage, ä	he is also carrying a cargo of wheat and timber ä	destined for delivery to a rich Vassagonian merchant ä	in Bisutan. For him this voyage promises to be very ä	profitable indeed. Unfortunately the Captain is ä	notoriously tight-fisted when it comes to spending ä	his money. He even expects you to pay for the meal! ä	Before you leave the tavern and return with him to ä	the ship, you must pay the innkeeper for both ä	breakfasts (erase 2 Gold Crowns from your ÈAction ä	ChartÈ).
