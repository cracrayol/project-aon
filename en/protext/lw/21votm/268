	The crowd roar with excitement the moment you strike Š	your killing blow. Dromodon staggers back, blood Š	trickling freely from his mouth, and he spits a curse Š	with his dying breath before crashing to the sand.
	The crowd erupt with wild elation and the guardsmen Š	are hard pressed to keep them from rushing headlong Š	into the arena. Dromodon's corpse is dragged Š	unceremoniously away and, amidst screams and cheers, Š	you are ushered before Torvax. He praises you for Š	your fighting skill and bravery and he offers you the Š	post of principal of his gladiator school in Š	Ferufezan. Politely you decline. It is customary for Š	the winner of the final combat of the circus to be Š	granted one request, and you ask that you my be Š	allowed to go free. Torvax nods in agreement. He is Š	grieved by the loss of his warrior-slave Malduz, but Š	he does not hold you responsible for his death. 
	
	Before he instructs his men to escort you to the Š	gates of the arena and let you go free, he hands you Š	a silk pouch containing 20 Gold Crowns. (If you had a Š	Bow confiscated before the combat with Dromodon, this Š	is returned to you on your way out of the arena)
