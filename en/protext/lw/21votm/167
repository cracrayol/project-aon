	The east road threads a lazy path through miles of Š	arid hills which border upon the wild blue ocean. Š	Soon the oppressive arid heat of the Dry Main is Š	tempered by fresh salty winds that sweep inland from Š	the wave-smashed shoreline. These cooling breezes Š	make the journey far easier and, as you ride, you are Š	able to relax and enjoy the ruggedly beautiful Š	scenery. As dusk draws its shadow across the sky you Š	find yourselves approaching a village which lies Š	sheltered in an emerald bay.


	If you wish to enter the village and seek shelter for Š	the night, turn to  â172â

	If you decide instead to camp out under the stars, Š	turn to  â65â
