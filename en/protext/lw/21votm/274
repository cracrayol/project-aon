	You scramble to your feet and pause to unsheathe a ä	hand weapon before you struggle across the heaving ä	deck and regain your position at the ship's rail. The ä	enemy vessel has rammed the ÈPride of SommerlundÈ and ä	now a host of screaming warriors are swarming aboard ä	your stricken ship. A shadow passes overhead and when ä	you look up you see the giant spider scurrying ä	towards the crow's nest. The Sommlending lookout ä	shrieks hysterically and, in blind panic, throws ä	himself into the sea to avoid being consumed by this ä	hideous monster. Through the smoke which shrouds the ä	deck below you can see Sergeant Dryan and his men ä	fighting bravely to repel the raiders. Those of ä	Raker's crew who have survived the collision ä	hurriedly arm themselves and rush to support the ä	outnumbered marines, but they are not trained ä	fighters and they are clearly no match for this ä	ruthless enemy. 


	If you wish to descend to the deck below and fight ä	alongside Sergeant Dryan's marines, turn to  ‚331‚

	If you choose instead to climb the rigging and attack ä	the giant spider that is now perched upon the crow's ä	nest, turn to  ‚299‚
