	Beyond its encircling wall the deserted streets of Š	Khor lend it the aspect of a ghost town. You magnify Š	your vision and you are able to count more than a Š	hundred freshly-dug graves within fifty paces of the Š	town gates. The gates themselves hang open and Š	unguarded, and when you pass through them, the hooves Š	of your horses make a hollow echo along the empty Š	streets beyond. You hear a distant bell tolling and Š	you follow the sound to a mount which overlooks the Š	town harbour. Here you see some of the inhabitants Š	for the first time and you are shocked by how pale Š	and gaunt they all appear. 
	
	A funeral is in progress and the bereaved are walking Š	in line behind a hearse which bears a casket draped Š	with black silk. The procession halts when it reaches Š	the top of the mount and then the casket is quickly Š	interred and sealed inside a marble tomb. A Š	dignified-looking man addresses the mourners. He Š	praises the qualities if the man they have laid to Š	rest and then, in his official capacity as the Mayor Š	of Khor, he declares that a state of quarantine will Š	exist in the town from midnight onwards. 

	"This quarantine will be strictly enforced," he says Š	with a stern voice, "until the scourge of Bita Fever Š	has be eradicated from our midst!"
