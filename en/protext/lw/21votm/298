	Rhous picks up the Kutyan Emerald and holds it to the ä	light. You can tell by his expression that he is ä	impressed by its flawless cut, yet still you sense he ä	is a little disappointed; he had hoped for something ä	more exceptional than this fine gem. After assessing ä	its worth he offers you 25 Gold Crowns. You haggle ä	with him and finally you settle on a sum of 30 Gold ä	Crowns.

	[If, in addition to the Kutyan Emerald, you also ä	possess any of the other items, Rhous would be ä	willing to pay you 10 Gold Crowns for the Iron Skull ä	and 20 Gold Crowns for the Siyen Crown. Be sure to ä	amend the details of your ÈAction ChartÈ before ä	continuing your adventure.]
