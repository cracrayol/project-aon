	You evade your enemies by scaling the mainmast as Š	swiftly as you can. As you climb higher, you begin to Š	notice chunks of wood are raining down from above. Š	You glance up and see that the giant spider is now Š	perched in the crow's nest, where it is busily Š	tearing at the mast and topsail with its fanged maw. Š	Fearful of what may happen if it should be allowed to Š	direct its power upon your countrymen below, you Š	decide that you must confront and slay this creature. 

       You approach the giant spider from below and, at Š	first, it fails to notice your presence. But when you Š	pause for a few moments to unsheathe your weapon, it Š	dips its head and you find yourself staring into a Š	pair of ghastly green eyes. It rubs its forelegs Š	together and sparks appear, warning you that it is Š	preparing to launch a bolt of energy. Quickly you cut Š	free a trailing rope and swing away from the mainmast Š	just in time to avoid being burnt to a cinder when it Š	launches its burst of crackling blue fire. Your swift Š	action saves you, but as the momentum of your swing Š	carries you back towards the mast, so you see that Š	the creature is preparing a new form of attack.
	
	It waits until you come to rest in the rigging, then Š	it ejects a stream of grey fluid from a sac located Š	below its gaping maw. This fluid hardens as it passes Š	through the air, transforming into several long and Š	sticky strands which threaten to engulf and imprison Š	you in a soft, gluey web.
