	You use the elemental power of your discipline to Š	whip up the damp earth and bombard the creature with Š	a shower of rock and soil. She shrieks as the sharp Š	shards of granite cut her face and paws, and for a Š	few moments she falters. But she does not abandon her Š	attack. Quickly you raise your weapon in readiness to Š	defend yourself as she presses home her assault.
