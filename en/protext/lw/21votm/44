	Your attempt to avoid being struck by the arrow is Š	not as successful as you could have wished for. It Š	penetrates your left shoulder and the energy of its Š	impact is enough to bring you crashing to the ground. Š	The archer laughs with glee when he sees you fall Š	and, with encouragement from the slaver who is Š	screaming at him to finish you off, he drops his bow Š	and leaps down from the platform. As he rushes Š	towards where you lie, he snatches his sword from its Š	scabbard and raises it in readiness to deliver a Š	fatal blow to your head.
