	You struggle across the heaving deck and grab hold of ä	the ship's spinning helm. Upon gaining control of the ä	wheel you are able to turn the heavy vessel away from ä	the pounding waves. Cold sea and hot flames lash at ä	your body as bravely you fight to steer the ÈDesert ä	JewelÈ towards a sliver of sunlight that glows like a ä	beacon of hope beyond this supernatural storm.
			
	After what seems like an eternity, the ship emerges ä	from the grim darkness and sails into a calm sea that ä	is bathed in warm sunlight. Behind you the storm ä	abates as quickly as it arrived and, one by one, the ä	crewmen begin to appear out of the hold. Their tanned ä	faces are pale and they are speechless with shock, ä	yet you can tell by the look in their eyes that they ä	are deeply grateful to have you aboard. Kol appears, ä	shaking and dishevelled, yet he finds the words to ä	express how he and his men feel. He praises your ä	skill and bravery and says that everyone aboard owes ä	you their lives. As a small token of his gratitude he ä	offers you his Sword, his Dagger, and a pouch ä	containing 20 Gold Crowns. (If you wish to keep any ä	of these items, be sure to amend your ÈAction ChartÈ ä	accordingly).

	All night the ÈDesert JewelÈ plies the warm southern ä	sea, and at dawn you awake on the rear deck and ä	witness a beautiful sight. A shoal of flying fish are ä	running alongside the ship. As they leap and dive ä	into the blue-green waves, their glistening bodies ä	reflect a rainbow of colour when they are struck by ä	the rays of the early morning sun. You breakfast with ä	the crew who, out of respect, insist that you have ä	only the best food that is on board (you may restore ä	3 ENDURANCE points. There is also sufficient food ä	left over for 2 Meals).
