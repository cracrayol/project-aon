	The archer's arrow hurtles across the street towards Š	you as if in slow motion. Your senses are alive to Š	the imminent danger, but you feel rooted to the Š	ground and incapable of moving out of its path.
	Then a starburst of pain erupts in your head and the Š	salty taste of blood fills your mouth. The arrow has Š	penetrated the front of your skull and death is Š	instantaneous.

	Tragically, your life and your quest end here in Š	Kilij.
