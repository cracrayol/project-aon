	Your Kai healing skills slowly neutralize the snake's Š	deadly venom, yet as they do battle with the toxins Š	in your blood, so your body is racked by agonising Š	convulsions: lose 8 ENDURANCE points.

	Fearing the worst, Oriah and the others gather around Š	your trembling body and do what they can to make your Š	last few moments of life as comfortable as possible. Š	When suddenly you begin to recover they can hardly Š	believe their eyes, for it is well-known that the Š	bite of a Jubai will kill its victim within one Š	minute. Your companions are open-mouthed with shock Š	when you stop trembling and sit up as if you are Š	waking from nothing more than a troubled dream.
