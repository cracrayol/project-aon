	Torvax commands the guardsmen to halt. Then he Š	swaggers over to where you lie and he looks down on Š	your fatigue-racked body with a sneer of disdain. 
	
	"Insolent dog!" he sneers, "you are not worthy even Š	of a public execution." And with this chilling remark Š	he signals to the surrounding guardsmen. As he walks Š	away, they raise their Bor muskets and take aim. Š	Suddenly an explosion of noise and colour obliterates Š	your senses as you are hit by a volley of musket Š	balls. Death is mercifully swift.

	Tragically, your life and your quest end here in the Š	gladiatorial arena of Bavari.
