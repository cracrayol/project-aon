	The Vakeros villagers greet you warmly as you ride Š	into their village. These tribal people have few Š	material possessions yet everywhere you look you see Š	smiling, happy, contented faces. Without asking nor Š	expecting any payment or reward, they give you food Š	and a place to sleep this night. Your horse is Š	watered and fed and you are treated like an honoured Š	guest. 
	
	You sleep well and awake at dawn feeling relaxed and Š	refreshed: restore 3 ENDURANCE points. When the time Š	comes for you to leave and continue your journey, the Š	young unmarried women of the village give you Š	garlands of flowers and they offer you fresh fruits Š	which they have picked from the village's fertile Š	fields (there is enough for 1 Meal).
