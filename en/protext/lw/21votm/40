	You seat yourself near the crackling campfire and one Š	of your fellow passengers offers you a piece of fruit Š	which you gratefully accept. The troubadours are Š	gifted acrobats and jugglers and the performances Š	they give are very entertaining. During their act the Š	leader of the troupe climbs upon a large barrel and Š	challenges the audience to answer a riddle:
	
	"A old one-legged farmer, his wife, his dog, his Š	horse, and his cows, have 103 legs between them. How Š	many cows does the old farmer have ?"

	The troubadour leader is sure that nobody will answer Š	his riddle correctly. He is so sure that he offers 10 Š	Gold Crowns to anyone who can give him the correct Š	answer in less than thirty seconds.

	If you would like to accept this challenge, use the Š	second hand of a clock or a wristwatch to time Š	yourself while you work out the answer. If you Š	complete the riddle in 30 seconds or less, turn to Š	the section number that is the same as your answer.

	If you run out of time, or if you choose not to Š	answer the riddle, turn instead to  â241â
