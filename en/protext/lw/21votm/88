	You leave the ship and walk cross the quayside to the Š	Good Cheer Inn. It is an old timber-framed tavern Š	which looks deserted at this early hour. A bell Š	tinkles as you push open its heavy door, attracting Š	the attention of a doe-eyed innkeeper who is mopping Š	last night's spilt ale from the floor. You ask if he Š	has seen Captain Raker.
	"You must be the journeyman who's sailing south." 
	The answer comes from the top of a staircase. Moments Š	later a broad-shouldered man with a golden beard and Š	sharp blue eyes comes striding down the stairs. "I'm Š	Raker," he says, as he struggles to pull on his Š	leather jerkin and fix the belt of his heavy-bladed Š	cutlass. "Hey, Squin. Go rustle me up some grub. I'm Š	so hungry m'stomach thinks m'throat's been cut." 
	As the innkeeper goes away to fetch breakfast for the Š	Captain, he asks if you want some food as well. 
	After having ridden all night without once stopping, Š	you answer: "I'll have whatever the Captain's Š	having."

	"Good man!" booms Raker, "I ain't fond of eating Š	alone. Here, let's sit ourselves down and fill our Š	bellies before we set sail."
