	You are awoken shortly after dawn by the sound of a ä	plaintive voice echoing across the rooftops of the ä	city. It is the cry of a Vassa Elder and he is ä	calling the faithful of Barrakeesh to early morning ä	prayer. You gather together your equipment and ä	Fernant's servant brings you a bowl and a pitcher of ä	water so that you may refresh yourself before sharing ä	breakfast with Oriah and the Lord-lieutenant.
	
	After breakfast, Fernant oversees the loading of bags ä	and other personal items aboard his mule-drawn ä	carriage. Then an hour before noon the three of you ä	leave for the quay and go aboard the ÈPride of ä	SommerlundÈ. At first Captain Raker is unhappy about ä	transporting Oriah, arguing that the presence of a ä	beautiful young woman aboard his ship will distract ä	his crew from their duties. However his objections ä	quickly evaporate when Fernant offers to pay him ä	twenty Gold Crowns for her passage to Bisutan. 
	
	The ship leaves Barrakeesh on the noon tide and makes ä	swift progress ahead of a favourable southerly wind. ä	But by dusk the wind has dropped, and Raker decides ä	to spend the first night at anchor in a protected ä	cove a few miles to the east of Chula. The night ä	passes peacefully and you wake at dawn to a ä	spectacular sight.
