	You wait until the last moment before you leap over Š	the falling statue. It shears the surface from the Š	steps on which, just seconds ago, you were standing Š	but you escape unscathed.	You see the statue finally Š	reach the bottom of the stairwell where it smashes Š	into several large segments which block the narrow Š	doorway and fill the base of the stairwell with thick Š	dust. Steeling yourself for what may lie ahead, you Š	hurry up the stairs in pursuit of your prey -  the Š	scourge of Hikas.
