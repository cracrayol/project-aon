	The early morning streets of Gologo are empty as you Š	ride towards its southern gate. Most of the Š	inhabitants are sleeping off last night's Š	celebrations and nobody sees you leave the town and Š	set off along the jungle trail to Elzian. 
	
	For most of the morning your view of the surrounding Š	land is restricted by the dense walls of verdant Š	foliage that border upon this ancient trail. It is Š	not until noon, when you crest a ridge of high Š	ground, that you catch sight of what lies beyond
	the seemingly endless jungle. Less than a mile to the Š	north is the titanic chasm of Gorgoron. It is a dark Š	and forbidding sight, like some a deep festering Š	wound in the land that time has been unable to heal. Š	Its sheer walls and immeasurable depth calls to mind Š	images of the Maakengorge, a dread chasm which lies Š	to the south of your homeland province of Ruanon. Š	Legend says that these vast canyons are scars Š	inflicted upon the flesh of Magnamund by the vengeful Š	hand of Naar.

	Beyond the ridge the trail descends to the ruins of Š	an ancient town. Here you stop to rest your horse and Š	drink from a pool of clear water that bubbles freely Š	from the loamy soil. Unless you possess the Š	discipline of Grand Huntmastery, you must now eat a Š	Meal or lose 3 ENDURANCE points.
