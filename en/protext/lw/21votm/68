	You ride the benign thermal currents that swirl Š	between these lower mountain peaks and enjoy a Š	spectacular aerial view of the Great Masourn range.
	Within the hour you emerge from the peaks and drift Š	towards columns of rock that rise up from the lower Š	slopes of the timbered mountainside. Circling above Š	one of these columns are six large black-winged Š	birds. You magnify your vision and your pulse Š	quickens when instantly you recognise them to be Š	itikars - giant Vassagonian eagles. 
	
	The leader of this predatory group has golden Š	markings on his wings tips that glint in the sun, Š	giving them a metallic appearance, and when he sees Š	the balloon approaching he veers away from the Š	column. The others follow his lead and all six come Š	flying towards you in a wedge-shaped formation.

	They fly past overhead and stare down at the balloon Š	with their cold black eyes. Then the leader turns Š	about and you sense that he intends to attack you on Š	his next pass. His companions form up behind him in a Š	line and he leads them in a steep dive.
	
	As he comes to within a hundred feet, he spreads his Š	razor-sharp talons and fixes his cruel eyes on the Š	balloon's vulnerable canopy.
