	"For Sommerlund and the Kai!" you cry, as fearlessly Š	you leap from the rear deck into the midst of the Š	enemy horde. You fell three armoured warriors with Š	the first sweep of your arm, and cleave the head from Š	the shoulders of another on your backstroke. Noise, Š	death, and confusion press in on all sides, yet you Š	remain ice-cool in the heat of this firece deck Š	battle. Bright steel flashes in your face and you Š	duck to avoid its bite, then you spring forward like Š	a charging lion, your weapon a deadly blurr as you Š	cut a devastating path through the raiders' packed Š	ranks. You have fought to within a dozen paces of Š	Sergeant Dryan when suddenly the raiders launch a Š	desperate counter-attack in an effort to halt your Š	inexorable advance.
