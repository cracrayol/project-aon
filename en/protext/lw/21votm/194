	You are woken in the middle of the night by a Š	tickling sensation just above your left knee. At Š	first you ignore it, but when you feel it moving you  Š	pull back the bedsheet and instantly you freeze. Š	Crawling slowly up your thigh is a red-legged spider, Š	with a copper-coloured body the same size as a gold Š	crown. At once your Kai instincts recognise it to be Š	a Zuath - a Vassagonian tree spider. Its venom has Š	been known to kill in seconds.
