	The moment you set foot into the streets outside the Š	arena you are mobbed by a crowd of excited citizens. Š	To avoid them you are forced to flee into a maze of Š	alleys and eventually you lose them in the town's Š	east quarter. Night is fast approaching and you sense Š	that it will be completely dark within the hour. As Š	you walk along a cobbled street towards the town's Š	east gate, you glance into the front windows of shops Š	and emporiums that are still open for business here Š	despite the lateness of the hour.
