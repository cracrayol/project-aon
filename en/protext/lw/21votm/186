	For two days you travel this road as it crosses the Š	lush coastal plain of north-eastern Dessi, which Š	nestles in the rain shadow of the Great Masourn Š	mountains. The land is bountiful and neither you nor Š	your trusty horse go hungry for want of fresh food. Š	By noon of the third day you come to a village  Š	thirty miles from the city of Hikas. At first the Š	villagers seem as placid and as peaceable as any you Š	have encountered during your travels through Dessi, Š	but the moment they see you approaching they Š	immediately freeze in their tracks. Some drop the Š	items they are carrying and others begin to tremble Š	with fear. 


	If you wish to stop and talk to these anxious Š	natives, turn to  â171â
	
	If you decide to ignore them, you can continue riding Š	the road to Hikas by turning to  â273â
