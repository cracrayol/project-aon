	You are less than fifty yards from the gatehouse when Š	suddenly the dull clang of an iron bell shatters the Š	evening calm of Cape Kabar. The owners of the Barczak Š	stables have discovered that some of their expensive Š	horses are missing and they have raised the alarm. Š	Through the open gate you glimpse the flicker of Š	torches and your keen ears detect the sound of Š	beating hooves. It is an armed search party and they Š	are following your tracks while they are still fresh.
	
	You call to your companions to stay close as you urge Š	your horse to the gallop. For ten miles you race Š	together along the flat coast road and are able to Š	maintain a safe distance from your pursuers, but when Š	the trail begins to ascend into the hills, the lack Š	of saddles and stirrups begins to exact its toll. Š	Those following behind have no such disadvantage and Š	rapidly they close the gap. 
	
	You are ascending a steep slope towards the crest of  Š	a moonlit ridge when ahead you see the beginning of a Š	hill track. It forks away from the main road and Š	disappears into the hills to your right.

	If you wish to steer your horse along this hill Š	track, turn to  â206â

	If you decide to stay on the coast road, turn to  Š	â189âs
