	You focus your Kai skills of nexus and curing upon Š	your bitten leg in an attempt to neutralize the Š	spider's poison and reduce the swelling. Eventually Š	this treatment works, but only after you have Š	suffered a great deal of discomfort and fatigue: lose Š	6 ENDURANCE points.

	You return to your bed and, as you sit down, you see Š	that the spider is still alive: it is clinging to the Š	far wall. You hurl your boot and it scurries down to Š	disappear through a crack in the uneven bamboo floor. Š	Your close encounter with this potentially deadly Š	spider plays on your mind and you find it impossible Š	to go back to sleep. At first light you gather Š	together your equipment and go down to the paddock to Š	collect your horse. The hostel-keeper calls you from Š	the kitchen window and holds up a large plate of food Š	that is your breakfast. The memory of the Zuath Š	crawling up your leg invades your mind and the Š	thought robs you of your appetite. You wave the man Š	farewell and then mount your horse and ride away Š	across the courtyard.
