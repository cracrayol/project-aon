	Captain Raker listens to your argument and agrees ä	that to send a party ashore to investigate the ruins ä	of Kita Cove would place his ship and crew at ä	unnecessary risk.
	
	Rather than delay a moment longer, he commands his ä	crew to unfurl every square inch of canvas to catch ä	the prevailing winds. The task is accomplished ä	quickly and soon the ÈPride of SommerlundÈ is 
	forging a swift passage south through the narrow ä	waters of the Bukimi Channel.
