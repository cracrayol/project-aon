	You wait until the last moment before you leap over Š	the falling statue. It shears the surface from the Š	steps on which, just seconds ago, you were standing, Š	but your reactions prove too slow for you to avoid Š	being struck a glancing blow to the neck and Š	shoulder: lose 5 ENDURANCE points.
	
	As you fall to the steps, you see the statue finally Š	reach the bottom of the stairwell where it smashes Š	into several large segments which block the narrow Š	doorway and fill the base of the stairwell with thick Š	dust. Gritting your teeth against the pain of your Š	injuries, you stagger to your feet and hurry as fast Š	as you can up the stairs in pursuit of your prey -  Š	the scourge of Hikas.
