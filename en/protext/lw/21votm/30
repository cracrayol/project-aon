	You whisper the words of the Brotherhood spell - ä	ÈSilenceÈ - and instantly the thief's wailing cries
	cease to echo through the market. The shocked young ä	man clutches at his throat and mouths vile curses at ä	you but no sound emerges from his mouth.

	"Behold!", you cry, in a loud and imperious tone, ä	"The Gods have struck this thief dumb for uttering ä	such falsehood 'gainst me!"

	Immediately the encircling crowd burst into laughter; ä	they think that the two of you are street actors. One ä	old woman is so amused that she congratulates the ä	dumb-struck thief and then presses 1 Gold Crown into ä	your hand in appreciation of your performance (you ä	may keep this if you wish). The thief seizes this ä	opportunity to escape and turns tail and flees across ä	the square with the laughter of the crowd still ä	echoing in his ears.
