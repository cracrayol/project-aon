	Torvax commands the guardsmen to wait. Then he Š	swaggers over to where you lie and he looks down at Š	you with a thoughtful expression fixed upon his Š	lordly face. His eyes glitter darkly.
	
	"You lack weight...I like my fighters to have weight Š	of muscle" he sneers, "but you have strength of Š	spirit. I have seen gladiators, who could lift an ox Š	with their bare hands, defeated in the arena by puny Š	men with fire in their souls. Perhaps you have fire Š	in your soul, Northlander? Fire enough to win for me Š	the victor's purse ?"

	Torvax signals to the guardsmen and they pull you to Š	your feet. "Very well, you fight for me at dusk.	You Š	will fight Dromodon the Invincible and you will win."

	"And if I lose?" you say, barely daring to ask the Š	question.

	"Then you die, Northlander. The final combat of the Š	circus is always to the death!"
