	The door bangs open against the wall and a loud Š	screech echoes from your room. This painfully sharp Š	noise makes you raise your weapon defencively, but as Š	you get ready to strike a blow, you suddenly see a Š	startled cat come hurtling through the doorway. You Š	smile to yourself and sheathe your weapon as you Š	watch the terrified cat scurry along the corridor Š	amidst a cloud of dust and loose fur. 

	The room itself is shabby but clean. You take off Š	your cloak and equipment, wash from a cracked Š	porcelain bowl, and then sit down on the threadbare Š	mattress which serves as a bed. Now your thoughts Š	return to your mission, and while you are pondering Š	what may yet lie in store for you on the road to Š	Elzian, you open the satchel containing the Moonstone
	and bathe in the warm glow which radiates from this Š	wondrous artifact. 
	
	Suddenly there is a knock on your door. The sound Š	gives you a start and quickly you buckle the satchel Š	and stow it under the mattress.
