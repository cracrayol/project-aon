	As you pull open the tent flap you see that Temujun's ä	young assistant is standing immediately outside. He ä	peers around you and sees his master lying ä	unconscious among his pillows.

	"A thousand apologies, Sire," he says, nervously ä	wringing his hands. "My master is an old man and he ä	gets tired. Please, do not be offended. He often ä	falls asleep during a consultation. Here, you may ä	have your money back..." and with this he takes two ä	gold crowns from his purse and presses them into your ä	hand (restore these 2 Gold Crowns to your ÈAction ä	ChartÈ).

	The waiting queue groan with disappointment when the ä	young boy tells them there will be no further ä	consultations with his master tonight. As he returns ä	their money, you walk down to the edge of the oasis ä	to bathe your face and drink the warm, fresh water. ä	The yellow flames of the campfire are glimmering on ä	its surface and you pause to consider joining the ä	travellers who are seated nearby, enjoying the ä	troubadour show.
 
	If you decide to go to the campfire, turn to  ‚40‚

	If you choose instead to retire to the empty carriage ä	and get some sleep, turn instead to  ‚290‚
