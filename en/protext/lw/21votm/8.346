	Despite the frugality of the innkeeper and the ä	drabness of your room, you manage to sleep well and ä	you rise at dawn feeling alert and refreshed (you may ä	restore 3 ENDURANCE points). You meet with the ä	marines and, foregoing breakfast, you walk to the ä	adjoining stables to collect your horses. The ä	innkeeper's daughter has already fed and watered them ä	and they are ready to be collected. However, before ä	she will let them go she demands you pay her a ä	stabling fee of 1 Gold Crown each. 


	If you have some money and you wish to pay her 1 Gold ä	Crown, turn to  ‚346‚

	If you no money, turn to  ‚208‚









		‚346‚

	Only when you have given her the crown coin and she ä	has tested it between her teeth to ensure that it is ä	not counterfeit does she hand you the reins of your ä	horse (remember to deduct this 1 Gold Crown from your ä	ÈAction ChartÈ).

	You have no desire to stay at this extortionate inn a ä	moment longer, and so you mount your horse and, with ä	a flick of your heel, you leave the stables and turn ä	south onto the mountain road.
