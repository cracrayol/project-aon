	You call out a friendly greeting to the nearest Š	villager and you see his face blanch. He throws up Š	his hands in alarm and runs headlong into the nearest Š	undergrowth. This begins a chain-reaction among the Š	other villagers who shriek with panic and flee in all Š	directions. Within a matter of minutes this village Š	has been transformed into a ghost town.
	
	Bemused and a little unnerved by their inexplicable Š	reaction, you pass through this cluster of empty Š	bamboo huts and continue on along the road towards Š	Hikas.
