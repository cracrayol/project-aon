	You try to recall what you know about the sickness Š	called Bita Fever. During your studies of the Kai Š	curing skills you were told about this tropical Š	disease, but all you can recall is that it
	originated in the Bita Swamp of Dessi and that 
	it is usually only fatal in the very young or the Š	old. Healthy adults rarely die from it, although the Š	symptoms in those affected are unsightly. Victims Š	suffer a scarlet rash that often affects the face and Š	hands. A normally healthy person who contracts the Š	disease will usually recover completely within a Š	month.

	When you look at the faces of the mourners you notice Š	that many of them are red and swollen. The marines Š	have never before encountered this disease before, Š	and when you tell them what you know, they insist on Š	leaving at once,before the quarantine is put into Š	force.
