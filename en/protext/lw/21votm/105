	Warily the Vakeros move forward to surround you, Š	their spears held out at arm's length as if they are Š	afraid to come to close. Their officer, a young Š	lieutenant, steps a pace nearer and you can see that Š	he is sweating profusely. It is a warm night but this Š	is not the reason he is perspiring: he is terrified. Š	Then he recognises the style of your tunic, and when Š	he looks carefully at your face you see the whipcord Š	tension in his body begin to ease.

	"You're a Kai ?"

	"Yes," you reply, "I'm a journeyman bound for Š	Elzian."

	The Vakeros signals to his men and expertly they Š	couch their spears and form up into a column in Š	readiness to march.

	"Well, master Kai," says the lieutenant, "You're Š	going to have to come with us."
