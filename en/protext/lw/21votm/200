	You sit up with a start and reach instinctively for Š	your weapon. Your horse is neighing wildly. Š	Repeatedly he rears up on his hind legs and fights to Š	break the reins which hold him fixed to a tree.
	He is clearly terrified of something from which he Š	cannot escape. You wipe the sleep from your bleary Š	eyes and scan the darkness. And then you see the Š	object of his terror and your blood freezes in your Š	veins.

	Creeping slowly from the shadowy undergrowth is the Š	Deathstalker, his amber eyes blazing like two evil Š	gems. At first you cannot believe what you are Š	seeing. The beast is dead. You saw the flames consume Š	his carcass. Then the realisation strikes you that Š	this is not the beast you slew in Hikas. This is his Š	mate. She has hunted you and now she comes for you in Š	the dead of night...and she is ravenous for revenge.

	She howls and the jungle falls silent. Now her amber Š	eyes blaze with evil fire as she bounds out of the Š	undergrowth and launches her vengeful attack.
