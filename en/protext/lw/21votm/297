	You move nearer to the trembling man and try to calm ä	him with soothing words and a promise that you will ä	protect him. You look to the bell and use your sixth ä	sense in an attempt to locate the creature, but you ä	can detect nothing unusual. Then you hear a faint ä	gurgling growl and a knot of fear tightens in your ä	throat. Now you can detect a powerful aura of evil. ä	You glance at the cowering cleric and your fear ä	becomes an icy terror when you realise that ÈheÈ is the ä	source of this evil. He	continues to plead with you  
	to save him, but then he sees the shock register on ä	your face and he abandons his pretence. 
	
	The pupils of his eyes shimmer and become spheres ä	that glow darkly amber and, in a terrifying instant, ä	his body transforms. One moment he is a bearded holy ä	man and, in a split-second blur, he becomes a ä	snarling hulk of black furred death. With ä	breathtaking speed he leaps at you and slashes at ä	your throat with his razor-sharp talons. Instinct ä	makes you propel yourself backwards to avoid these ä	deadly claws and, as you spring away, you slip and ä	tumble headlong down the spiral stairs.
