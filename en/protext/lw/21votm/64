	"He's right," says the rogue, and sheepishly he backs Š	away from your table. "He can't be the creature," Š	whispers one of the other men, "It wouldn't know the Š	answer."

	Confused and angered by their actions, and by what Š	they are saying, you rise from your seat and demand Š	an explanation. The innkeeper hurries over with a Š	tankard of ale in his hand. He and the men apologise
	for the frosty reception you have received since you Š	entered the tavern, and the innkeeper offers you the Š	ale, free of charge, as if to make amends for their Š	behaviour.

	"I don't want your ale," you snap, "What I want is an Š	explanation. What's really going on here ?"

	The innkeeper looks at you and there is fear behind Š	his eyes. "Very well," he says, "I'll tell you. It's Š	only right that you should know."
