	You use your magnakai healing skills to revive the ä	old man and calm his trembling limbs. Then you help ä	him to sit up and, when he has regained his ä	composure, he looks into your eyes and says:
	
	"You are one of the Kai, yes ?" You nod your head and ä	a smile deepens the wrinkles around his mouth. "You ä	possess a stone of power...a legendary stone ?" This ä	time you hesitate, but you sense that it is a ä	rhetorical question: the old man already knows the ä	answer. Briefly he searches among his pillows and ä	retrieves a leather-bound tube. He flips open one end ä	of the tube and tips a plain-looking ring into the ä	palm of his hand. It seems to be crafted from ä	petrified wood.

	"Take this, Kai Lord," he says, and proffers you the ä	ring, "it will keep you safe on your long journey. ä	That which you seek to return ÈmustÈ be delivered."

	You take the ring and place it in the pocket of your ä	tunic (record Temujun's Ring as a Special Item on ä	your ÈAction ChartÈ). The old man smiles once more and, ä	although no words are exchanged, you sense that he is ä	deeply satisfied to be able to assist your vital ä	mission.

	You thank him and leave his tent. Once outside, you ä	walk down to the edge of the oasis to bathe your face ä	and drink the warm, fresh water. The yellow flames of ä	the campfire are glimmering on its surface and you ä	pause to consider joining the travellers who are ä	seated around it, enjoying the troubadour show.
 

	If you decide to go to the campfire, turn to  ‚40‚

	If you choose to retire to the empty carriage and get ä	some sleep, turn instead to  ‚290‚
