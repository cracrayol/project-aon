	You are in good spirits when you reach the ancient Š	gates of Gologo. Your day's ride has been swift and Š	enjoyable, and you are looking forward to beginning Š	the final leg of your journey to Elzian tomorrow at Š	first light. You are now only two days ride away from Š	that wondrous city.

	The town of Gologo has a mysterious and exotic aura. Š	Its ancient streets are cobbled with lime green Š	stone, and ornate structures of vivid Vakeros art Š	embellish every building and street corner. There is Š	a festival taking place here tonight and the town is Š	in a lively carnival mood. As you ride down a steeply Š	narrow street towards the beach, you can see a crowd Š	of native Vakeros are gathered there in brightly Š	coloured costumes. Some wear elaborate headgear made Š	from lacquered wood and feathers, and others are Š	covered from neck to ankle with garments made from Š	vibrant jungle blooms. There is a full moon tonight Š	and the people of this town are celebrating the Š	fertility of their land with ritual offerings of food Š	and wine to the Goddess Ishir. It is a joyous Š	festival and everyone on the beach is smiling and Š	happy.
	
	If you wish to go to the beach and join in the Š	festival, turn to  â251â
	
	If you choose instead to look for an inn or a lodging Š	house where you can stay the night, turn to  â321â
