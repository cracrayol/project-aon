	The hostel-keeper pockets your crowns (erase these ä	from your ÈAction ChartÈ) and leads you up a flight of ä	rickety bamboo stairs to a corridor which is hung ä	with gaudy tapestries. He points to the first door on ä	the right and then he bids you goodnight.
	
	"What about my key?" you say. He looks at you and ä	shrugs, "No key," he says, and then he turns away and ä	shuffles back down the stairs.	You push open the door ä	to find large room with a balcony that offers you a 
	magnificent view of the beach festival.
	
	Pick a number from the ÈRandom Number TableÈ.


	If the number you have chosen is  ‚0‚ - ‚4‚, turn to  ‚330‚

	If it is  ‚5‚ - ‚9‚, turn to  ‚92‚
