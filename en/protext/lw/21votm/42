	You scan the distant island, using your Grand Master ä	discipline to enhance your innate visual skills.
	The shoreline appears deserted, but when you cast ä	your gaze towards the east you notice several dots on ä	the horizon. You alert Captain Raker and he brings ä	his telescope to bear. After a few moments ä	observation he shouts an order to Paoll:

	"South-by-south west, if you please First Mate. Looks ä	like we've got comp'ny!"
	
	The timbers creak as the ship turns about and forges ä	a passage through deep water. Following the change of ä	bearing the wind is now no longer in your favour and ä	Paoll is forced to tack against it to make progress. ä	The distant ships are now visible and it is clear to ä	all aboard that they are pirate raiders. Soon another ä	two islands rise into view and the Captain orders his ä	First Mate to steer a course towards a narrow channel ä	which separates them.
	
	"That's the Bukimi Channel," says Raker, "If we can ä	pass through afore those sea dogs, we'll pick up ä	southerly winds on the far side. Then they'll never ä	catch us!"
