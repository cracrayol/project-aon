	The militia have orders to impose the curfew and Š	arrest anyone caught on the streets after dark. As Š	you march alongside the young lieutenant on your way Š	to the city's guardhouse, you ask him why such stern Š	measures have been imposed, especially in Hikas which Š	is considered to be one of the most peaceful and Š	civilised cities of Magnamund. 

	"The people of Hikas are living in fear of their Š	lives," says the lieutenant. "For the past month Š	there's been a creature stalking our streets at Š	night. It's killed more than fifty poor souls, and in Š	terrible fashion. Ripped 'em to pieces. There isn't Š	anyone who's lived to tell what it looks like but  Š	everyone's got their own ideas. Some say it's a Š	shapechanger that goes about at day in the guise of a Š	man and changes into a beast at night. Others say Š	it's come from Gorgoron, seeking revenge on the Old Š	Kingdom for the death of its master - Agarash the Š	Damned. I don't know what to think. All I know is Š	that it walks these streets, and every night someone Š	dies a ghastly death by it's hand."
	
	Suddenly a terrible shriek echoes through the empty Š	streets. A woman standing on the balcony of a tall Š	building nearby, leans over the parapet and calls out Š	to the lieutenant.
	"Down by the river," she shouts, and she points over Š	the rooftops to where the shriek was heard, "The Š	fiend...it's struck again!"

	"Quick men!" yells the lieutenant, "Follow me. If Š	we're swift we may catch the beast this night."
