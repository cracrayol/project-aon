	You watch as Captain Raker takes over the helm from ä	his first mate and attempts to manouver the ship out ä	of the path of the oncoming vessels. The leading ä	pirate ship has now closed to within fifty yards and ä	its murderous crew are crowded shoulder-to-shoulder ä	upon its forward deck. Clearly they intend to leap ä	aboard as soon as their ship draws alongside. From ä	your position beside the deck rail you can see ä	Sergeant Dryan directing his men at the bow. Dryan's ä	marines are busily loading the three swivel cannon ä	which are fixed to the port gunwale. Once loaded, ä	each marine gunner raises his hand to signal that his ä	piece is primed to fire. Dryan is waiting for the ä	third gunner to signal. He is ready to give the order ä	to fire when suddenly there is a thunderous roar and ä	a puff of grey smoke erupts unexpectedly from the ä	prow of the attacking ship.
