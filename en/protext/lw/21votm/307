	The basket lurches as the effects of your Kai Š	Discipline causes the balloon to veer away from the Š	mountainside. It misses the outcrop with but a few Š	feet to spare. Yranai manages to regain control of Š	the engine and he steers the craft back towards the Š	middle of the pass, to where the thermal currents are Š	less volatile.

	As you emerge from the high mountain pass, you enter Š	denser and more stable air that cushions your flight Š	and soon all trace of turbulence is left behind.

	"Well, that was exciting wasn't it!" says Yranai, Š	ruefully. It takes a great deal of self-control not Š	to throttle the old man for his incompetence, but you Š	keep your hands firmly on the rail and you force a Š	smile. Silently you vow never to fly with him again.

	You are looking forward to setting your feet down Š	safely on firm ground when you see something in the Š	distance that fills you with unease.
