	The innkeeper growls and knocks the two coins off the Š	bar with the edge of his hand. "I don't want Š	y'money," he roars, "I want you out of here, now! Do Š	I make myself clear ?"
	
	Then the rogue and his shadowy companions sidle their Š	way back to the counter and move in to surround you.

	"You heard him," says one of the men, "there ain't no Š	rooms here."

	"Yeah! That's right," sneers the rogue, "so why don't Š	you be gettin' on your way, friend." And with this	he Š	whips a dagger from his belt and stabs it into the Š	counter. He glances at his companions and instantly Š	they reach to the hilts of their swords.
