	You pay the woman (erase 3 Gold Crowns) and she hands Š	you a key on which is stamped the number '4'. Then Š	she points to a corridor on the ground floor which Š	leads to your room at the rear of the building. As Š	you are about to insert the key into the lock, you Š	hear a suspicious noise coming from somewhere inside Š	your room. Silently you unsheathe your weapon, unlock Š	the door, and then fling it wide open.
