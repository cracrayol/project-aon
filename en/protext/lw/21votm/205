	Through a combination of skilful helmsmanship and ä	crewmanship, the ÈPride of SommerlundÈ enters the ä	Bukimi Channel and picks up a prevailing wind that ä	propels you away from the pirate raiders. Soon they ä	have disappeared beyond the distant horizon and, when ä	Raker is sure that they have abandoned their pursuit, ä	he warmly praises his first mate and crew for their ä	seamanship. 

	As the ship navigates the narrow strait dividing two ä	Lakuri islands, you pass by the fire-blackened ruins ä	of a beach settlement which nestles in a bay ä	overshadowed by cliffs. This is Kita Cove, formerly a ä	secret base from where Captain Khadro launched his ä	pirate fleet. As you stare at the charred remnants of ä	the pirate settlement, you try to imagine what it ä	must have looked like before the encampment was ä	consumed by the tremendous fireball that sealed its ä	doom. Suddenly your daydreaming is interupted when, ä	to your shocked surprise, you see something moving ä	among the ruins.
