	An hour passes before your turn comes to enter Š	Temukun's tent. Awaiting you inside is an old man Š	swathed in a silk robe. He wears a jewel-encrusted Š	collar and a large blue turban that is wrapped Š	impeccably around his frail head. He is seated cross-Š	legged on a mound of pillows and he cradles a sphere Š	of rose-coloured crystal in his lap.
			
	Without once looking up from his crystal sphere he Š	tells you to sit opposite him and place any weapons Š	you may be carrying on the floor beside you.	When you Š	comply with his wishes he closes his eyes and begins Š	to concentrate. A few moments later he opens them and Š	stares at your satchel with a look of shocked Š	surprise; you sense at once that he has detected the Š	presence of the Moonstone. The frail old man begins Š	to shake and beads of sweat trickle down his wrinkled Š	face. For a moment his eyes widen and then he faints Š	and falls backwards among his pillows.

	If you choose instead to pick up your weapons and Š	leave the tent, turn to  â149â
