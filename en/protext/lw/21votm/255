	"The Funtal's a madman!" splutters Kol. "All those Š	poor fools who got took away last night are goin' to Š	lose their cargoes, or their gold, or their ships. Š	You mark my words. I'd not be surprised if some Š	o'them lose their lives into the bargain. It's not Š	safe here no more. Not like the old days." Kol then Š	procedes to wash down his hearty breakfast with a Š	tankard of ale. He pauses to emit a long loud belch, Š	and then he repeats his offer of a place aboard his Š	ship which sails for Bisutan at noon. The marines do Š	not object to you leaving them if you so wish. Should Š	you decide to continue your journey to Elzian without Š	them, they will attempt to sell your horse and use Š	the money to buy passage aboard the next ship heading Š	north.
	
	
	If you now choose to accept Kol's offer, turn to  â119â
	
	If you decide to stay with your travelling companions Š	and continue your journey south with them by road, Š	turn to â73â
