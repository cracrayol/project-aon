	You watch with fearful anticipation as the second ä	wave of enemy raiders come leaping aboard the ÈPride ä	of SommerlundÈ. The ship's crew and the marines have ä	suffered many casualties and they are now too weak ä	and exhausted to be able to repel this renewed ä	assault. You know that you must act quickly if you ä	are to avert a disaster.
	
	Steeling yourself, you tighten your grip on your ä	weapon and leap from the rigging as the enemy leader ä	passes below the mainmast. You hit the armoured ä	warrior feet first and slam him to the deck, but he ä	quickly recovers from this surprise attack and, in ä	the ensuing struggle, he manages to kick the weapon ä	from your hand. 
	
	"Leave this one to me!" he screams, warning off his  	
	henchmen who are poised to rush forward and cut you ä	down. He unsheathes his scimitar and, with a sneer ä	fixed to his cruel lips, he raises the blade in ä	readiness to strike at your head.
