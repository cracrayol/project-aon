	The village consists of a circle of conical huts Š	thatched with toa leaves. As you ride towards them, a Š	giggling swarm of young children come rushing from Š	the open doorways and quickly surround your horse. Š	They hold open their grubby palms and beg you for Š	money.


	If you wish to give these children some Gold Crowns, Š	turn to  â166â
