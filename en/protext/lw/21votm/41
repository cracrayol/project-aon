	The creature emits a desperate howl as your last Š	mighty blow seals its doom. It lurches at you, its Š	eyes white in their red-rimmed sockets, its great Š	clawed arms swinging blindly. And then this Š	supernatural horror surrenders to death and is Š	brought crashing to the floor. For a few moments its Š	great body convulses and then lies still. Wisps of Š	noisome gas arises from beneath the fur and you are Š	forced to snatch your cloak to your face to deaden Š	the sickly sweet stench of decay. You turn and hurry Š	down the stairs in time to see the lieutenant and his Š	militia breaking through the rubble which blocks the Š	exit from the belltower. His men ascend the stairs Š	and remove the vile, rotting remains of the Š	Deathstalker which are placed upon a pyre outside in Š	the tree-lined plaza. Soon the carcass of this Š	murderous creature is ablaze and word of its death Š	spreads swiftly across the city. The curfew is lifted Š	and a large crowd come and gather around the dying Š	embers of the pyre to cheer and rejoice in the Š	destruction of the creature which, for the past Š	month, has murdered their kinfolk and terrorised Š	their peaceful city.
