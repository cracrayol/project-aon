	On returning to the ship, you and your party clamber ä	aboard and the longboat is quickly hoisted back onto ä	the main deck. Captain Raker is keen to get the ship ä	underway and he commands his crew to unfurl every ä	square inch of canvas to catch the prevailing winds. ä	Within minutes of your return, the ÈPride of ä	SommerlundÈ is once again back on course, forging a ä	swift passage south through the Bukimi Channel.
