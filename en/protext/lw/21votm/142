	You awake with the dawn feeling refreshed and eager ä	to begin the day's ride south towards the city of Bir ä	Rabalou. During the morning, you and your travelling ä	companions pass several traders and caravans that are ä	heading north to sell their wares in Cape Kabar. Your ä	fair complexions and Sommlending clothes draw many ä	suspicious glances from the caravan drivers, 	ä	prompting you to stop when you come to a village ä	shortly after mid-day. Here the marines go looking ä	for some Mhaktis - the flowing grey and white robes ä	traditionally worn by the desert dwellers of ä	Vassagonia. While they busy themselves in the hunt ä	for new clothes, you water and feed the horses at the ä	village stables. You are tending to the horses when ä	you are approached by an elderly street vendor. He is  ä	pushing a handcart on which he has displayed the ä	following items for sale:

	Dagger                        Scented Oil              
	3 Candles                     Slippers                 
	Copper Cup                    Rope                     
	Lantern                       Lyre (musical instrument)
	Ball of Chalk                 3 Arrows                 

	The vendor's items cost 1 Gold Crown each. If you ä	wish to purchase one of more of them, remember to ä	adjust your ÈAction ChartÈ accordingly.

	After a while the three marines return to the ä	stables. They are now dressed in Mhaktis and, when ä	they pull up their hoods, you feel sure that they ä	could pass for native Vassagonians. They bundle and ä	tie their marine uniforms to the saddle blankets of ä	their horses, then the four of you mount up and leave ä	this village. The sun is sinking below the desert ä	horizon when you come to the next village on the road ä	to Bir Rabalou. It is located on the fringe of a wide ä	beach and it can only be reached by a sandy track ä	which branches away from the main coast road. As you ä	reach this junction you notice a group of local ä	people have gathered around something that has washed ä	up on the beach.


	If you wish to leave the main road and go down to the ä	beach, turn to  ‚24‚

	If you choose to ignore this coastal village and ä	continue your ride south, turn to  ‚232‚
