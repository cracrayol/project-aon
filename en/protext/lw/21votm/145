	"So much for hospitality," you quip sarcastically as Š	you walk to the door. A tense silence fills the Š	tavern, and the innkeeper and the crowd watch you go Š	with hatred and fear burning in their eyes. You are Š	only too glad to leave, but when you step outside Š	into the darkening street you discover to your dismay Š	that your horse, Jhani, has disappeared. Two men Š	appear in the doorway behind you with swords in their Š	hands. You decide it would be futile to ask them if Š	they have seen your horse and so you walk off along Š	the street in search of somewhere a little more Š	friendly to stay this night.
