	From the reverent way the passengers spoke about Š	Temujun during the journey, you are expecting him to Š	be either a very wise old cleric or a gifted Š	charlatan. You take your place in line with the Š	others who are queuing to enter his tent and idly you Š	listen to their excited chatter. While you wait, a Š	young boy clad in a mhuktis of striped silk walks Š	along the line collecting Temujun's fee. For five Š	minutes consultation with the learned sage the charge Š	is 2 Gold Crowns.


	If you wish to pay the fee, turn to  â140â

	If you cannot afford the charge, or if you choose not Š	to pay it, turn instead to  â234â
