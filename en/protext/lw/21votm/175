	Suddenly six burly gladiators come rushing into the Š	room with their swords drawn. 
	"How dare you enter the chamber of the font!" screams Š	one scar-faced fighter. "It is forbidden!" shouts Š	another. "Only gladiators of vassa lineage may enter Š	here and drink the holy waters!"
	
	There is further outrage when they see your attacker Š	lying on the floor. The scar-faced fighter kneels and Š	places a hand to the man's neck, then he glares at Š	you and screams: "He's dead! You've killed Malduz!"
	"We'll see you pay for this," shouts another, and Š	slowly the angry men advance into the room with Š	murder blazing in their eyes.

	Desperately you look around you for a means to Š	escape, but the doorway offers the only way of Š	leaving the room. You are about to rush at the Š	advancing gladiators and fight your way through them, Š	when suddenly you see somthing that stops you dead in Š	your tracks.
