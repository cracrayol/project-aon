	You examine the plants closely and are able to ä	identify them as Cowana - a marine variety of ä	Laumspur. These plants possess the same healing ä	qualities as their land-based cousin, and there are ä	enough growing here for three doses. 

	Each dose of Cowana will restore 4 ENDURANCE points ä	to your total when swallowed after combat. If you ä	wish to keep one or more doses, record them on your ä	ÈAction ChartÈ as a Backpack Item. Each dose will take ä	up one space in your Backpack.
