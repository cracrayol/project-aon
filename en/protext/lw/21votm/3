	You utter the words of the Brotherhood spell - ä	ÈLightning HandÈ - and extend your right fist towards ä	the onrushing creature. A tingle runs down your arm ä	and a burst of blue-white light illuminates the ä	surrounding jungle when a bolt of energy leaps from ä	your hand and arcs towards the creature's chest.
	The bolt strikes, and the Deathstalker's mate shrieks ä	as it burns deep into her shoulder. She falters but ä	she does not abandon her attack, and quickly you ä	raise your weapon in readiness to receive it.
