	The landlady's frowning face softens when you hand ä	her 3 Gold Crowns (erase these from your ÈAction ä	ChartÈ). She slips the money into the pocket of her ä	apron and from this same pocket she removes a key ä	which is stamped with the number '4'. She hands it to ä	you and then she points to a corridor on the ground ä	floor which leads to this room at the rear of the ä	building. 
	
	As you are about to insert the key into the lock, you ä	hear a suspicious noise coming from somewhere inside. ä	Silently you unsheathe your weapon, unlock the door, ä	and then fling it wide open.
