	The evil that lingers around this chamber makes your Š	skin crawl and you decide to stay here not a moment Š	longer. You and Oriah climb the stone steps and Š	return to the marines who now are hiding among the Š	boulders at the edge of the plateau. Ernan tells you Š	that during your absence he has watched the riders Š	pass by the entrance to the hill track and continue Š	along the coast road for several miles. Just a few Š	minutes before you arrived, these same riders came Š	galloping back along the road towards to Cape Kabar. Š	He is convinced that they have called off the chase Š	and have decided to return to their town.  	

	Now that the threat appears to have passed, you and Š	your travelling companions remount your horses and Š	leave this plateau.
