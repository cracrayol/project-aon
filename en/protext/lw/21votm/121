	Swiftly you scale the rigging and approach the giant Š	spider from below. It is busily tearing at the mast Š	and topsail with its fanged maw, and at first it Š	fails to notice you. For a few moments you stop to Š	unsheathe your weapon and suddenly the creature dips Š	its head and fixes you with a pair of ghastly green Š	eyes. It rubs its forelegs together and sparks Š	appear, warning you that it is preparing to launch a Š	bolt of energy. Quickly you cut free a trailing rope Š	and swing away from the rigging just in time to avoid Š	being burnt to a cinder when it launches its burst of Š	crackling blue fire. Your swift action saves you, but Š	as the momentum of your swing carries you back Š	towards the rigging, so you see that the creature is Š	preparing a new form of attack.
	
	It waits until you come to rest upon the criss-cross Š	of ropes and then it ejects a stream of grey fluid Š	from a sac located below its gaping maw. This fluid Š	hardens as it passes through the air, and it Š	transforms into several long and sticky strands which Š	threaten to engulf you.
