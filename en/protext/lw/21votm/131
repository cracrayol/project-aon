	The innkeeper says nothing, he just narrows his eyes Š	and his jaw sets rock-hard. Then the rogue and his Š	shadowy companions sidle their way back to the Š	counter and move to surround you.

	"You heard him," says one of the men, "there ain't no Š	rooms."

	"Yeah! That's right," sneers the rogue, "so why don't Š	you be gettin' on your way, friend." And with this	he Š	whips a dagger from his belt and stabs it into the Š	counter. He glances at his companions and instantly Š	they reach to the hilts of their swords.
