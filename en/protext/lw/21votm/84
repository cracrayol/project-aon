	You press yourself flat against your horse's neck and Š	listen as the archer's arrow buzzes towards you like Š	and angry hornet. Then you feel a sharp pain in your Š	back as its tip grazes your spine (lose 2 ENDURANCE Š	points). For a few uncertain moments the marines Š	believe that you have been mortally wounded, but they Š	are quick to cheer when they see you sit up and Š	glance over your shoulder. Despite the stinging pain Š	of your wound you manage a smile and you acknowledge Š	their glad shout with a wave of your hand. Then you Š	dig your heels into your horses flanks once more and Š	gallop along this avenue which leads out Kilij.
