	You approach the gates of Hikas just as the last rays Š	of sunlight are dipping below the western horizon. Š	Bathed in the sun's afterglow this ancient city-port 
	looks warmly inviting, and you cast your eye Š	appraisingly across the stone geometry of its Š	protective wall, its conical towers, and its Š	pyramidal dwellings. Every surface is embellished Š	with runic symbols yet few remain legible for Š	thousands of years have elapsed since they were Š	carved.

	The Vakeros at the east gate recognize your Kai tunic Š	and offer you a guarded welcome. They warn you that a Š	curfew is in force and tell you to be off the streets Š	by dark. You pass through the gate and follow a long Š	shadowy street that descends towards the wharfs and Š	taverns that line the banks of the Carcos River - a Š	murky, silt-rich channel which divides the city in Š	two. Mindful of the imminent curfew, you tether your Š	horse to a rail and enter the nearest tavern in Š	search of a room for the night. Inside the air is hot Š	and stale. A small number of men and women of mixed Š	nationality stand at the counter and sit at small Š	tables. Their low-voiced conversations break off as Š	you let the tavern door shut behind you with a bang.
