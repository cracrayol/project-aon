	With all sails unfurled, the ÈPride of SommerlundÈ cuts ä	a swift course through the foam-flecked ocean. During ä	the afternoon your southerly passage is joined by a ä	school of dolphins who entertain you by leaping and ä	plunging into the azure waves. The wind is strong and ä	the ship sails without incident until, early the ä	following morning, the isles off Cape Kabar appear in ä	a line upon the southern horizon.

	You meet with Fernant and Oriah on the rear deck and ä	share a breakfast together of bread and grilled ä	Trarta. As you eat, you trade tales of past visits to ä	distant lands. You are enjoying the company of your ä	travelling companions when suddenly the relaxed and ä	easy mood is shattered by the lookout's frantic ä	shout: "Pirate raider off the starboard bow !"
