	You command the leader to break off his attack and he Š	immediately obeys your mental sugestion. Yranai Š	cheers but his triumphant cry is premature. You watch Š	aghast as the following itikars collide with the Š	balloon and stab their talons into the canopy,
	shredding its cloth to ribbons before they fly away.

	The impact of the birds hitting the canopy knocks you Š	off your feet. Yranai falls on top of you and, for a Š	few nerve-racking seconds, you lie entangled at the Š	bottom of the basket as the balloon rapidly loses Š	altitude. When you pull yourself up and peer over the Š	rim, you see the trees of the lower mountain slopes Š	rising towards you at a dizzying speed. Yranai looks Š	up to see shreds of cloth trailing from the punctured Š	canopy above and the sight proves too much for him: Š	he faints. Hurriedly you haul his frail body over Š	your shoulder. Then you place one foot on the rim of Š	the basket and get ready to make a desperate leap Š	away from this doomed balloon as the tops of the Š	mountain pines come into view.
