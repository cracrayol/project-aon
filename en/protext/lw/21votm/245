	As you take your seat, you hear the low conversation Š	begin once more among the men who are standing at the Š	counter. Your keen ear quickly discerns from the Š	grumbling tone of their voices that they are a Š	suspicious and distrusting group. After a few minutes Š	they leave the counter and gather around your table. Š	A bilious rogue, with close-set eyes and cleft chin, Š	thumps on your table with his fist. He demands to Š	know where you have come from, and what business you Š	have here.


	If you wish to tell him that you are from Sommerlund Š	and that you are travelling to Elzian, turn to â309â

	If you decide to tell him nothing, turn to  â258â
