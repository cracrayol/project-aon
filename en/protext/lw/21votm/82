	The guardsmen take you away to a dingy cell below the ä	arena where you are kept until the time comes for you ä	to meet your opponent. You are allowed to keep your ä	weapons, including your Kai Weapon, but you are ä	warned that the use of sorcery within the gladatorial ä	arena is strictly forbidden. Torvax despises magic ä	and any breach of this rule will result in immediate ä	execution. (The contest is restricted to hand weapons ä	only; if you possess a Bow it is now confiscated and ä	you must delete it from your ÈAction ChartÈ)

	Within the hour the guardsmen return: it is time for ä	you to meet your adversary. As you are led from your ä	cell and escorted along the tunnel, you can hear the ä	crowd above roaring with excitement. Then, as you ä	step into the fading sunlight, you hear gasps of ä	astonishment from some quarters. They come from your ä	fellow travellers who cannot believe that it is you, ä	the friendly Northlander, who is to fight Dromodon ä	the Invincible to the death. The guardsmen march you ä	to the centre of the arena and leave you standing ä	there alone under the watchful gaze of the expectant ä	crowd. Minutes later the crowd erupt when Dromodon ä	emerges from the tunnel.
