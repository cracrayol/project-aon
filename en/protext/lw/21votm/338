	Your refusal to pay infuriates the toll collector. He ä	brandishes his sword at you and threatens to cut off ä	your ears. The marines laugh at his bravado; they are ä	in no doubt who would end up the loser if he was ä	foolish enough to pick a fight with you. Their ä	disparaging laughter wounds his pride and you sense ä	that he is about to fly into a blind rage. Using your ä	psychic Kai powers, you cool his anger and persuade ä	him to put away his sword. He does so, and politely ä	now he asks that you pay a toll of 4 Gold Crowns to ä	cross the bridge. With a nod of your head you ä	indicate to your companions that this is a fair price ä	and you each hand him 1 Gold Crown apiece (deduct ä	this 1 Gold Crown from your ÈAction ChartÈ; if you have ä	no money you must erase one backpack item instead).
	
	The reduced toll charge does not include a night's ä	lodging at the village inn and so you ride through ä	the village and set up camp on a wooded slope a mile ä	beyond. The night is bitterly cold and the close ä	proximity of scavenging timber wolves frighten your ä	horses and prevent you from getting much sleep (lose ä	3 ENDURANCE points). At first light you strike camp ä	and continue your ride through the Koneshi Pass.
