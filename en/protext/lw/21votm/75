	The enemy ship is less than a hundred yards off the ä	port beam when you see the dark shape at its prow ä	begin to twitch and shudder. At first it resembles ä	the body of some grotesque gigantic tic, then eight ä	rubbery legs spring from its black underbelly and ä	suddenly the shape takes on a far more sinister ä	aspect. 
	
	A gasp of terror arises from the crew when this ä	spider-like monstrosity opens its scarlet maw and ä	emits a high-pitched chittering shriek. As the enemy ä	vessel speeds nearer you watch with mounting dread as ä	this hideous spider-creature raises its forelegs, as ä	if in readiness to pounce. Furiously it rubs its ä	forelimbs together and a mass of blue-white sparks ä	appear at their tips. Then suddenly there is a ä	deafening crackle of electrical power. A bolt of ä	blazing energy shoots from the creature's maw and ä	snakes across the water towards the crew and marines ä	aboard your ship. The creature's attack hits its mark ä	and the effect is swift and devastating. The ä	crackling bolt ignites timber and sail, and leaves a ä	dozen men sprawled dead and unconscious across the ä	decks. Through the smoke of the burning sailcloth you ä	see the enemy vessel bearing down to ram the ÈPride of ä	SommerlundÈ. Impact is but seconds away.
