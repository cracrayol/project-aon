	As you lie on your mattress and stare at the night Š	sky, you call upon your knowledge of astrology to Š	search for portents among the configuration of stars.
	You determine the outlines of a serpent and a wide-Š	bladed sword, and you take these images to be a Š	warning of possible treachery and conflict ahead. 
	The images stay in your mind's eye until, gradually, Š	you drift into a fitful sleep.
