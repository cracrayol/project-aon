	Rhous picks up the crown and examines it carefully.
	You can tell by his frowning expression that he is a ä	little disappointed: he had hoped for something more ä	exceptional than this. After a few moments he offers ä	you 15 Gold Crowns. You haggle with him and finally ä	you settle on a sum of 20 Gold Crowns.

	[If, in addition to the Siyen Crown, you also possess ä	any of the other items, Rhous would be willing to pay ä	you 10 Gold Crowns for the Iron Skull and 30 Gold ä	Crowns for the Kutyan Emerald. Be sure to amend the ä	details of your ÈAction ChartÈ before continuing your ä	adventure.]
