	You prepare your horses and leave the stables shortly Š	after dawn. The streets of Bir Rabalou are quiet this Š	morning and you reach the city's south gate without Š	incident. Here you gallop straight through the open Š	gates to avoid any risk of being detained by the Š	surly guards. They shout and curse you and loose off Š	a few arrows in your wake, but these are poorly aimed Š	and you escape from the city unharmed.
	
	It is approaching noon when you arrive at a junction Š	where the coast road splits in two. Ahead of you are Š	the gentle foothills of the Koneshi Mountains, and Š	beyond them you glimpse the snowy peaks of the great Š	range rising majestically into the cloudless sky. Š	Away to the east you can see the rugged coastline of Š	southern Vassagonia where the cresting ocean waves Š	break their backs upon wild and rocky beaches. 
	
	A signpost at the junction points to the east and to Š	the south. To the east it reads: KHOR - 100 MILES / Š	BISUTAN - 225 MILES. To the south it reads: KONESHI Š	PASS TO BISUTAN - 125 MILES.


	Consult the map at the front of this book before you Š	decide which road you wish to travel in order to Š	reach the city of Bisutan.


	If you choose the coastal road (east), turn to  â167â

	If you choose the mountain road (south), turn to  â152â
