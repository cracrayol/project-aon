	You reach an empty landing where a new circular Š	stairway ascends to the top of the belltower. There Š	are two sets of fresh tracks in the dust here; one Š	set are human prints, but the other set are unlike Š	anything you have ever seen before. 
	
	With your Kai senses alert to every sight, sound, and Š	smell, you ascend the spiral stairs. You are halfway Š	to the top of the tower when you hear a man's voice Š	whimpering for help. It sounds as if he is trapped Š	somewhere near the top of the stairs. You raise your Š	weapon and quicken your pace until you arrive inside Š	the bell chamber. Here a great bronze bell hangs Š	suspended by chains from the apex of the tower. 
	Something moves in the shadows away to your left and Š	your raise your weapon in readiness to strike out, Š	but you stay your hand when you see that it is a Š	bearded man. He is dressed in the robes of a cleric Š	of the temple and he is cowering with fright. He sees Š	you and points to the bell.

	"It's...it's there. Behind the bell. For Ishir's Š	sake, help me...help me."
