	As you ride across the firm sandy beach towards the Š	excited crowd you see that they are gathered around Š	the carcass of a whale. These poor villagers are Š	celebrating their unexpected good fortune for this Š	whale will provide them with food for a month, and Š	enough oil to fuel their lamps until winter. A Š	cheerful-looking old man hails you with his walking Š	stick and you slow your horse to a halt.

	"You be bound for Bir Rabalou, good Sirs ?" he asks,
	"'cause if you is, then you'd do well to heed my Š	advice."

	"And what advice would that be ?" replies Ernan. The Š	old man give him a thin smile and then hobbles nearer Š	to your horse. He does not say anything; he simply Š	holds out his hand in the hope that you will pay him Š	something for his advice.


	If you wish to give this old man 1 Gold Crown, turn Š	to  â219â
	
	If you choose not to give him anything, turn to  â313â
