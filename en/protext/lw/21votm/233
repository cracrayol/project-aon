	You leap onto the iron gate and climb with cat-like ä	speed and grace. Unfortunately, as you leap over, you ä	snag your backpack on a spike. You pull free, but in ä	doing so you destroy one item in your pack (erase ä	from your ÈAction ChartÈ the item which you have ä	recorded last on your list of Backpack Items).
	
	You drop to the street beyond and follow it to a ä	tree-lined plaza which is bordered by shops that sell ä	rare artifacts and expensive works of art. Their ä	windows and doors are securely barred and shuttered ä	and show no signs of a forced entry.	Then your eye is ä	drawn to a grand building on the far side of the ä	plaza: it is a temple. Its great stone door is ä	closed, but a smaller wooden door at the side has ä	been torn off its hinges. You magnify your vision and ä	see that beyond the door are a flight of stone steps ä	which ascend to a belltower.
	
	Cautiously you approach the shattered door. You ä	unsheathe your weapon and scan the darkened stairs ä	before silently you move up the steps. You have ä	climbed twenty steps when suddenly you hear a hideous ä	snickering growl and an icy chill runs the length of ä	your spine. There is an ominous creak of stone on ä	stone and a movement in the darkness above, then a ä	crashing fills your ears. Out of the darkness you see ä	a great marble statue come smashing down the narrow ä	stairway. It rapidly gathers speed as it tumbles end ä	over end towards you.
