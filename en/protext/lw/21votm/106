	You find your room at the end of a corridor on the Š	first floor and you are pleased to discover that it Š	is clean and well furnished. You fall asleep within Š	minutes of lying down upon the feather-mattressed Š	bed, yet it seems as if you have barely closed your Š	eyes when, two hours later, you are rudely awoken by Š	noises in the taproom below. The éclompé of iron-shod Š	boots and the hubbub of angry voices make you leap Š	from your bed and reach for your weapon. Quickly you Š	gather your equipment and cloak and ease open the Š	door to your room. Outside in the corridor you see Š	your companions; like you they have been awoken by Š	the commotion downstairs.
			
	"It's the City Guard," whispers Oswin, who is peering Š	down the stairwell. Then the tavernkeeper appears and Š	he comes rushing up the stairs. His face is red as a Š	beetroot and he is shaking with fright. "The...the Š	Funtal of Bir Rabalou's men are here," he says, his Š	voice wavering. "They've had word that there are Š	assassins abroad in the harbour and they're checking Š	all foreigners. You're to go down to the taproom at Š	once."

	If you choose to comply with the tavernkeeper's Š	request to go downstairs to the taproom, turn 
	to  â33â

	If instead you choose to ignore his request, you can Š	search for somewhere to hide from the City Guard by Š	turning to  â2â
