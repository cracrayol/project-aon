	The pirate leader gasps his last breath and then ä	crashes lifelessly to the deck. For a few moments his ä	men stand transfixed with shock, as if they are ä	unable to comprehend that he is truly dead. Then the ä	reality of their loss crashes in upon them and they ä	become overwhelmed by the worst of their fears. ä	Leaderless and alone, they scream like frightened ä	children and discard their weapons and armour in ä	their haste to escape from your ship. 
	
	Captain Raker orders his surviving crew members to ä	cut the grappling lines which hold the two vessels ä	together. When the last rope is severed there is a ä	great rending of iron and timber as the ram of the ä	pirate ship wrenches itself free from the ÈPride of ä	Sommerlund'sÈ port side. Then a cheer resounds from ä	the mouths of those Sommlending who have survived ä	this desperate battle when they see the enemy ship ä	turn about and flee for the safety of the isles of ä	Cape Kabar.
	
	(You may now retrieve any weapon lost during the ä	course of the battle)
