	Your weapon is clasped firmly in your fist when you Š	turn around and find yourself staring into the face Š	of a tall and powerfully built Vassagonian warrior. Š	His eyes are glowing with a maniacal anger as he Š	comes rushing towards you with his hands Š	outstretched, as if his intention is to strangle you. Š	Before you can utter a sound, he slams into your Š	chest and impales himself on your weapon. 
	
	With a yelp of pain he pulls away and turns towards Š	the open doorway. He takes three faltering steps and Š	then collapses and lies motionless upon the tiled Š	floor.
