	You throw yourself flat against your horse's neck and Š	you hear the archer's arrow as it whistles across Š	your shoulder blades. Its tip grazes the back of your Š	tunic and narrowly misses penetrating your spine by Š	less than an inch. For a few uncertain moments the Š	marines believe that you have been mortally wounded, Š	but they are quick to cheer when they see you sit up Š	unharmed. You acknowledge their shout with a wave of Š	your hand and lead them at a gallop out of this Š	unfriendly mountain town.
