	Your weapon barely clears its scabbard before the Š	creature is upon you. The vile stench of its breath Š	fills your nostrils and you are slammed against the Š	wall by the sheer momentum of its attack: lose 2 Š	ENDURANCE points. You duck to evade its slashing Š	claws and they rake deep grooves in the wall above Š	your head. Then you twist your body sideways and Š	manage to pull away, creating the vital space you Š	need in order to wield your weapon against this Š	terrible foe.
