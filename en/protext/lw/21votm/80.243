	Your swift blow strikes the spider and sends it ä	hurtling across the room, but not before it has had a ä	chance to inject its lethal poison into your thigh. 
	A red-hot lance of pain shoots up your thigh and make ä	you cry out in agony. You muster your Kai healing ä	skills to counter the venom, but the pain hardly ä	recedes at all.

	You roll off the bed and drag yourself across the ä	floor to where your backpack lies. Hurriedly to pull ä	open the flap, retrieve the Cowana herb, and rub it ä	vigorously into your thigh. The pain eases and, in a ä	matter of minutes, you sense that the deadly venom ä	has been neutralised by the properties of the ä	powerful healing properties of this herb. (erase ä	Cowana from your ÈAction ChartÈ).

	You return to your bed and, as you sit down, you see ä	that the spider is still alive: it is clinging to the ä	far wall. You hurl your boot and it scurries down to ä	disappear through a crack in the uneven bamboo floor. ä	Your close encounter with this potentially deadly ä	spider plays on your mind and you find it impossible ä	to go back to sleep (lose 3 ENDURANCE points due to ä	nausea and fatigue). 
	
	At first light you gather together your equipment and ä	go down to the paddock to collect your horse. The ä	hostel-keeper calls you from the kitchen window and ä	holds up a large plate of food that is your ä	breakfast. The memory of the Zuath crawling up your ä	leg invades your mind and the thought robs you of ä	your appetite. You wave the man farewell and then ä	mount your horse and ride away across the courtyard.
