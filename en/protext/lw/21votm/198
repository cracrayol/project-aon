	You join Fernant and Raker at the bow and watch as Š	Oriah makes several dives upon the sunken wreck.	She Š	is a strong and graceful swimmer, and you can tell by Š	the effortless way she moves through the water that Š	she is a skilled and experienced at sea diving.
	
	The galleon is broken at its centre and lies with its Š	fore and aft sections seperated by an expanse of  Š	debris-strewn sand. Oriah searches both sections and Š	discovers a dagger and a handful of gold and silver Š	coins. Having satisfied herself that there is little Š	else of value to be found, she returns aboard and Š	allows herself to dry off in the hot noon sun. Š	Captain Raker gives the order to weigh anchor and Š	soon the Pride of Sommerlund is forging a course once Š	more through open seas.
