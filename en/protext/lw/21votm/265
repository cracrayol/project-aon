	You think back to the months that you spent studying Š	the discipline of Deliverance at the Kai Monastery, Š	and you try to recall what you can about the illness Š	known as Bita Fever. 
	
	It is a highly contagious airborne disease that Š	originated in the Bita Swamp of Dessi. In humans it Š	is usually only fatal in the very young or the old; Š	healthy adults rarely die from it, although the Š	symptoms in those affected are uncomfortable and Š	unsightly. Victims suffer from a corpse-like pallor Š	and can sometimes develop a vivid scarlet rash that Š	particularly affects the face, feet and hands. Š	Gradually a normally healthy person who contracts the Š	disease will develop an immunity to it after fifteen Š	to twenty days, and outbreaks of Bita Fever in towns Š	and cities have rarely be known last longer than a Š	month.

	When you look at the faces of the mourners you notice Š	that many of them exhibit the symptoms of Bita Fever. Š	The marines have never before encountered this Š	tropical disease, and when you inform them of what Š	you know, they insist on leaving the town at once, Š	before the quarantine is put into force.
