	You turn and sprint back along the street, but you ä	have taken only a few paces when you hear a Vakeros 
	shout a single, thunderous word: È"Gloar!"È
	
	A concussive blast of air hits you in the middle of ä	your back and sends you tumbling forwards to crash ä	face first to the ground. You strike your head on the ä	cobblestones and badly bruise your shoulder as you ä	sommersault into the base of a street lantern-post: ä	lose 3 ENDURANCE points.

	You have been struck by the effects of the Old ä	Kingdom spell - ÈPower WordÈ. Painfully you stagger to ä	your feet and see that the Vakeros have moved forward ä	to surround you. As they close in, you notice that ä	their spears are held out at arm's length as if they ä	are afraid to come too close. Their officer, a young ä	lieutenant, steps a pace nearer and you see that he ä	is sweating profusely. It is a warm night but this is ä	not the reason he is perspiring: he is terrified. ä	Then he recognises the style of your tunic, and when ä	he looks carefully at your face you see the whipcord ä	tension in his body begin to ease a little.

	"You're a Kai ?"

	"Yes," you reply, "I'm a journeyman bound for ä	Elzian."

	The Vakeros signals to his men and expertly they ä	couch their spears and form up into a column in ä	readiness to march.

	"Well, master Kai," says the lieutenant, "You
	had better come with us."
