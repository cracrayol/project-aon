	The elder points the tip of his black staff at the Š	satchel containing the Moonstone which is slung over Š	your shoulder. You feel the warmth of the stone Š	rapidly increasing until the satchel becomes Š	uncomfortably hot against your thigh (lose 2 Š	ENDURANCE points). You are about to cry out in pain Š	when suddenly the elder moves his staff and the heat Š	of the stone swiftly cools. 
	
	Although you have suffered physical discomfort Š	induced by his magical staff, you sense that the Š	elder is still unaware of what the satchel contains. Š	The korlinium lining has kept your secret secure.
