	Carefully you intone the words of the Brotherhood ä	spell ÈSense EvilÈ. The moment you utter the final ä	spell-word you suddenly realise that the shadowy ä	creatures, whom you glimpsed lurking among the ruins ä	of Kita Cove, are wholly evil. They possess a ä	malicious power which could be directed against the ä	ship. Immediately you inform Captain Raker of your ä	discovery and urge him to steer the ship away from ä	Kita Cove as swiftly as he can. The Captain heeds ä	your warning and commands his crew to unfurl every ä	square inch of canvas to catch the prevailing winds ä	which will carry you away from this sinister place.
