	The road from Hikas to Gologo is an ancient trail Š	which crosses rich plantations of tropical crops that Š	are cultivated by the Vakeros, and then meanders Š	through wild expanses of jungle that have for Š	centuries defied all attempts at cultivation. As you Š	ride this lush road, you are reminded of your history Š	lessons at the Kai Monastery and you recall some the Š	the things you were taught about this ancient realm.

	Dessi is ruled by the Elder Magi who are all that Š	remain of a race of great magicians who once ruled Š	central Magnamund thousands of years ago. They were Š	the first practitioners of magic upon this world, and Š	they were wise and powerful leaders until their Š	numbers were decimated by a Great Plague that was Š	released by their enemies - the Cener Druids of Ruel. Š	Those who survived sought refuge here in fertile Š	Dessi and have lived here ever since.   

	At noon you reach a place where the road passes Š	beside a majestic waterfall, and you stop here to Š	rest your horse and enjoy the beautiful scenery Š	(unless you possess the discipline of Grand Š	Huntmastery, you must now eat a Meal or lose 3 Š	ENDURANCE points). Then you continue your ride and Š	your strong horse makes excellent progress, carrying Š	you all the way to the coastal town of Gologo to Š	arrive there shortly before sunset.
