	You take hold of the thief roughly by the throat and, 
	using your Kai mastery to mimic his nasal accent,  Š	you say: "Accuse your own brother of theft, would 
	you ? I'll teach you to go filching m'things when Š	m'back is turned." And with this, you slap him across Š	the top the head with the back of your hand and Š	snatch back the item he has stolen from you.
	
	The crowd immediately lose interest in what they now Š	believe is just an everyday squabble between two Š	brothers, and they continue about their own business.
	
	The thief is struck dumb by the sheer audacity of Š	your ploy. When you release your grip of his throat, Š	he scurries away into the crowd like a frightened Š	rat.
