	Your action to avoid being struck by the arrow is 
	a success. The slaver and his archer cannot believe Š	what they have seen and for a few vital seconds they Š	stand frozen in stunned disbelief. You seize this Š	advantage and rush towards the platform with the hope Š	of catching them before they regain their senses, yet Š	as you make your leap you see the archer drop his bow Š	and reach to his sword. His blade clears its scabbard Š	barely a second before you make your attack, yet he Š	is able to turn aside your first blow. The skill with Š	which he handles his blade leaves you in no doubt Š	that you are facing an expert swordsman. Frightened Š	slaves throw themselves off the platform as you and Š	Svolta begin a desperate fight to the death.
