	You enter this musty emporium and cast your ä	experienced eye across its shelves and glass-fronted ä	cabinets. A toothless old crone is standing behind
	a toa-wood counter and she bids you welcome. As you ä	walk around the shop she watches you like a hawk.

	Most of her wares appear to be second hand items of ä	little value or practical use. Of all the thousands ä	of things that are crammed into this shop, only the ä	following catch your eye:

	        Rope        -    3 Gold Crowns      
	        Blanket     -    2 Gold Crowns      
 	        Hourglass   -    3 Gold Crowns      
	        Tinderbox   -    2 Gold Crowns      
	        Spyglass    -    2 Gold Crown 

	If you wish to purchase one of more of the above ä	Backpack Items, remember to adjust your ÈAction ChartÈ ä	accordingly.
