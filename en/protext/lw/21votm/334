	You leap over the bodies of the slain guardsmen and Š	escape into the darkening streets beyond. You are Š	unfamiliar with the passages and avenues of Bir Š	Rabalou, yet, aided by your tracking skills, you Š	manage to find your way back to the Tradewind Tavern. Š	Here you are fortunate to discover the three marines Š	who, despite their best efforts this day, have been Š	unable to sell your horse to raise enough money to Š	leave. They are surprised to see you come walking Š	through the door, but very glad that you have Š	returned. Oswin tells you that a curfew has been Š	declared and that all foreigners have been forbidden Š	to use the streets after dark. The tavernkeeper, who Š	openly hates the Funtal, offers to hide you in the Š	stables tonight in case the city guard should pay Š	another visit. Gratefully you accept his offer and Š	spend a comfortable night hiding in his hay loft.
