	Having concluded your business, Rhous gets ready to Š	leave your room. But when he reaches the door he Š	suddenly turns around and glances down at the Š	mattress. The strap of your satchel can just be seen.
	
	"Are you sure you have nothing else you wish to sell Š	me ?" he asks ruefully. 
	
	Firmly but politely you say no and bid him goodnight. Š	The old magician leaves and, as you close and lock Š	your door, you hear his footfalls gradually fading as Š	he walks off along the corridor.
