	By using your basic Kai skills you are able to 
	determine that this man is a rich trader from Casiorn Š	- the city of merchants. He seems harmless enough, Š	his only fault perhaps is that he has comsumed too Š	much ale. Yet you are suspicious of the fact that he Š	has identified you as a journeyman, which leads you Š	to suspect that perhaps he has met other Kai in the Š	past. You are about to ignore him and retire to your Š	room when he repeats his request that you join him at Š	his table. Out of curiosity you decide to find out Š	what he wants.
