	You steer your horse along a street running parallel Š	to the beach, and enter the courtyard of a large two-Š	storey hostel with stables. A young boy takes your Š	horse's reins and leads him away to an enclosure 
	at the side of this brightly-painted building, and Š	you enter the hostel's front door to find it is Š	empty. It seems that everyone has gone to the beach Š	this evening. Then you hear a noise from beyond an Š	open doorway and a balding man appears. He rubs his Š	blood-shot eyes and yawns, revealing a mouthful of Š	gold teeth. You ask if he has a room for the night Š	and lazily he nods his head.

	"I've two types of room and service," he says, Š	"There's Standard and there's Best. Standard costs 2 Š	Gold Crowns a night and you don't get no food. Best Š	costs 4 Gold Crowns and you get lots of food in the Š	morning."


	If you wish to buy a Standard room for the night, Š	turn to â216â

	If you decide to buy a Best room, turn to  â138â
