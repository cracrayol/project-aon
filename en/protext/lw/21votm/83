	The man snakes his way through the crowd with Š	surprising speed. He is fast and agile, but he is no Š	match for a Kai Grand Master and you quickly catch Š	him. Your suspicions were correct: he is clasping to Š	his chest an item from your backpack (the first item Š	on your list). Having been caught red-handed, this Š	wily thief now tries to turn the tables on you. He Š	screams at the top of his voice that you are robbing Š	him. His wailing cries attract the crowd's attention Š	and soon you find yourself surrounding by a score of Š	scowling faces, all looking accusingly at you.
