	From the cover of the distant isles there emerges a ä	fearsome warship. You magnify your vision and focus ä	upon the oncoming vessel to see that it is rigged with ä	a scarlet mainsail emblazoned with a strange design - ä	a serpent entwined about the blade of silver scimitar. ä	You relay these details to Fernant and Oriah gasps ä	with fright.

	"It's the symbol of Ghol-Tabras," he says, "the 
	city-state ruled by Sesketera." The merest mention of ä	her evil suitor's name is enough to make Oriah faint ä	with shock. You catch her as she falls, then Fernant ä	lifts her into his arms and carries her below to her ä	cabin. Once they have left the deck, you turn your ä	full attention to the oncoming vessel for now it is ä	clear by its course that it intends to ram the ÈPride ä	of SommerlundÈ.
	
	Captain Raker sounds the battle alarm and his crew ä	attempt desperately to bring the ship out of the ä	enemy's path. Sergeant Dryan's marines hastily load ä	their cannons and get ready to fire upon his command. ä	The enemy vessel alters course to maintain its ä	attacking line and, as it closes to within two hundred ä	yards, you see that it is a formidable fighting craft. ä	Plates of iron protect its prow and lines of warriors, ä	clad in scarlet and silver armour, man its decks and ä	forecastle. Then you notice a dark shape perched upon ä	the ship's ram which protrudes from below its ä	bowsprit. You focus upon this strange shape, but ä	before you can determine its nature your senses are ä	assailed by a wave of powerful psychic energy.
