	You decline to answer his question directly for you Š	do not wish to give him the impression that you are Š	familiar with the ways of magic. Rather than reveal Š	your true identity, or the reasons why you now find Š	yourself in Bisutan, you simply say that you are a Š	traveller who is on his way south.

	"Mmmm..." mutters the old man, clearly bemused, Š	"perhaps, you have acquired something...émagicalé... Š	whilst on your travels ?  I am a collector of magical Š	artifacts. In fact that is why I've come to Bisutan. Š	If you have anything of an arcane nature I would be Š	most keen to make you an offer of purchase."
	
	
	If you possess an Iron Skull, a Kutyan Emerald, or a Š	Siyen Crown, and you wish to sell one or more of Š	these Special Items to the old magician, turn 
	to  â54â
	
	If you do not possess any of these items, or if you Š	do not want to sell one (or more) of them, turn 
	to  â262â
