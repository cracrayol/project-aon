	You step back from the body of the last henchman to Š	fall to your deadly blows, and you move to take hold Š	of Oriah by the hand before making a hasty escape Š	from the square. But as you turn on your heel you Š	discover that she is no longer behind you. Then you Š	hear her scream and when you look up you see that she Š	is being carried away on the back of a gigantic bird. 
	
	It is an Itikar, a huge Vassagonian eagle, and seated Š	astride its feathered neck is a warrior who has taken Š	Oriah captive during your fight with the slaver's Š	henchmen. Desperately you race after the great bird Š	as it carries her away over the rooftops of Kilij, Š	yet as you sprint across the square you see a dozen Š	armed men emerge from the watching crowd to block Š	your path. The Itikar and its precious cargo are Š	rapidly disappearing towards the northern hills and Š	you know now in your heart that it is too late to Š	save Oriah. Then you hear the sound of cruel laughter Š	echoing across the square and it brings you skidding Š	to a halt. It is the laugh of the slaver; he can Š	barely contain his delight at having captured such a Š	beautiful young woman, and he is relishing the Š	thought of watching as the remainder of his henchmen Š	make you pay for the deaths of their comrades.
	Swiftly you assess your perilous situation and Š	determine two ways in which you may save yourself Š	from the slaver's gang of bloodthirsty thugs.
	

	If you wish to run back across the square and attack Š	the slaver, turn to  â78â
	
	If you wish to attempt to reach the town's bazaar and Š	find the marines, turn to  â126â
