	The moment you turn around you find yourself staring ä	into the face of tall and powerfully built ä	Vassagonian warrior. His eyes glow with a maniacal ä	anger and, without warning, he closes his hands ä	around your throat and crushes your windpipe in a ä	vice-tight grip. Blood pounds at your temples and ä	your vision blurs as he lifts you bodily from the ä	floor. To break his grip you slam your boot into his ä	stomach and he doubles up, releasing you as he falls ä	gasping to his knees.

	You stagger backwards and grab the fountain for ä	support as gingerly you clasp your bruised throat. ä	With croaking voice you demand the warrior explain
	the reason for his unprovoked attack. He answers you ä	with a growl, then he draws his sword and strikes out ä	at your legs. You leap over his scything blade and ä	kick out in mid-air to catch him squarely between the ä	eyes with the hardened toe of your boot. The warrior ä	is flung backwards and you hear a loud ÈCrack!È as his ä	head strikes the tiled floor.
