	The owner places the items under his counter and then Š	he ushers all four of you to a table. After a few Š	minutes his wife appears carrying four plates, each Š	stacked high with a mound of fresh vegetables and Š	poached fish. While you enjoy this delicious meal, Š	you listen to the marines talking about their homes Š	and families back in Kirlu, their past tours of duty, Š	and their fond memories of Sergeant Dryan. You sense Š	that each man, in his own way, is grieving the loss Š	of his brave young sergeant. Soon their jovial Š	conversation has become tinged with melancholy and Š	homesickness and you become a little worried by their Š	mood of sadness. To raise their morale you ask the Š	owner to bring them each a measure of his finest Š	brew. Gladly he accepts your order and pours each man Š	a flagon of strong dark ale. This proves most Š	effective in curing their melancholy for it is so Š	strong that it renders all four of them unconscious! Š	With the owner's help you carry the marines to their Š	beds and then return to enjoy a small glass of ale in Š	his company. A little while later an old woman enters Š	the inn clutching a basket filled with bones, dice, Š	and other fortune-telling paraphernalia. She offers Š	to tell you the secrets of your future in return for Š	1 Gold Crown.
