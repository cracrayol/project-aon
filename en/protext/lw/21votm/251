	You tie your horse's reins to a post driven into the Š	ground at the edge of the beach, and then you walk Š	across the fine white sand and pass among the throng of Š	dancing, singing people. A pulsating rhythm of native Š	drums provides the music to which they move and play. Š	You are caught up in a procession of gaily dressed Š	Vakeros who are each carrying baskets piled high with Š	exotic fruits, works of art, and intricate wood carvings Š	inlayed with semi-precious stones. To the rhythm of the Š	drums they carry you with them towards a wooden platform Š	constructed near the middle of the beach. There they Š	place their offerings to the Goddess Ishir. When you Š	find yourself standing at this platform, at the head of Š	the procession, suddenly the drumming stops. Everyone Š	who has approached the platform before you has made an Š	offering and yet your hands are empty. Suddenly it is as Š	if the eyes of the entire town are watching you in Š	expectation, and you feel compelled to make an offering.
