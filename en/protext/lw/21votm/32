	To your dismay you discover that there are hundreds Š	of tracks covering these cobblestones, and you cannot Š	be sure which of them belong to the creature that you Š	are chasing. Hurriedly you decide to follow the left Š	alley, but as a precaution you direct the militia to Š	go off along the right alley. 
	
	After a few hundred yards the alley opens out into a Š	small square surrounded by private houses. There is Š	only one exit from this square, other than the one by Š	which you entered, and it is barred by a heavy iron Š	gate. Lanterns surrounding the square illuminate the Š	flagstones and you are unable to see any tracks that Š	have been made here within the last hour. Suddenly Š	the ghastly howl shreds the silence of the city once Š	more. You focus your keen Kai senses and detect that Š	it came from somewhere beyond the iron gate. Now you Š	are sure that you have come the wrong way.


	If you wish to retrace your steps back to the Š	junction and enter the right alley, turn to  â14â

	If you decide instead to climb over the iron gate,
	turn to  â233â
