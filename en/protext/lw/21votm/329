	Through the use of your advanced Kai skills you are Š	able to determine that this man is a rich trader from Š	Casiorn - the city of merchants. You detect no aura Š	of evil about him and you sense that he does not Š	intend to do you harm. The fact that he has Š	identified you as a journeyman leads you to suspect Š	that he has met other Kai in the past. 
	
	He repeats his request that you join him at his table Š	and curiosity prompts you to accept his invitation.
