	Oriah accompanies you as you make your way quickly Š	towards the stone steps. The marines stay on the Š	surface and observe the riders while the two of you Š	investigate where these mysterious steps lead. 	Š	Together you descend fifty feet into the ground and Š	arrive at a chamber that is littered with skulls and Š	human bones. There is a carved archway near the Š	bottom of the steps but it is sealed by a slab of Š	grey marble. As you inch your way towards it, you try Š	to decipher some of the engravings which embellish Š	its surface. They are in an ancient script yet you Š	are able to determine their meaning: they are clues Š	to the number which must be spoken aloud if you wish Š	for the portal to open.

	To discover the number which will make this portal Š	open, firstly you must determine the distance (in Š	miles) of your journey from Holmgard to Elzian. Š	Having found this number you must then divide it by Š	the number of Grand Master disciplines which exist.

	If you are able to calculate the answer from these Š	two clues, turn now to the section which has the same Š	number as your answer. 
	
	If you are unable to determine	the correct answer, or Š	if you choose not to open this portal, turn instead Š	to â39â
