	Dromodon strides into the arena with his arms flung Š	wide to receive the frenzied adulation of the crowd. Š	He is a magnificent lion of a man, with broad Š	shoulders and a mighty chest that ripples with Š	bronzed muscle. His grim face is stern and majestic Š	beneath a mane of wild black hair, and he moves with Š	the confidence and grace of a huge, predatory animal. Š	At first he appears to be the very embodiment
	of gladiatorial perfection, and you regret that you Š	should have to fight this heroic warrior to the Š	death. But your regrets soon evaporate when you look Š	into his eyes, for you see revealed there his true Š	nature. Beneath the fa‡ade of his heroic exterior Š	lurks a soul filled with evil. You senses tell you Š	that he is a secret worshipper of Naar. The Dark God Š	has given him many rewards - his strength and his Š	status - and in return Dromodon has consigned Š	hundreds of noble souls to an eternity of slavery in Š	the thrall of Naar. Now you see him for what he Š	really is - a ruthless murderer, a heartless killing Š	machine - and all empathy with him as a fellow Š	warrior is lost. This will be a fight to the death Š	and you must fight to win!
