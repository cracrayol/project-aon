	Your arrow punctures the leader's breastplate, but Š	its steel tip does not sink deeply enough into his Š	chest to cause him a fatal wound. He snaps the shaft Š	of the missile in two and casts it aside with Š	contempt. To your dismay, you see that his men are Š	greatly impressed by their leader's apparent Š	invulnerability and this greatly helps to revive Š	their flagging morale.
