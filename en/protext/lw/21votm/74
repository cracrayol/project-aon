	"The people of Hikas are living in fear of their Š	lives," says the innkeeper, as he draws up a chair Š	and sits with you at your table. "For the past month Š	there's been a creature stalking our streets at Š	night. It's killed more than fifty poor souls, and in Š	terrible fashion. Ripped 'em to pieces. There ain't Š	anyone who's lived to tell what it looks like but  Š	everyone's got their own ideas. Some say it's a Š	shapechanger that goes about at day in the guise of a Š	man and changes into a beast at night. Others say Š	it's come from Gorgoron, seeking revenge on the Old Š	Kingdom for the death of its master - Agarash the Š	Damned. I...I don't know what to think. All I know is Š	that it stalks the streets, and every night someone Š	dies a ghastly death by it's hand."
	
	Suddenly the door to the tavern opens and in strides Š	a Vakeros soldier with a sword wavering in his hand. Š	He is wearing the uniform of a lieutenant of the Š	city's militia, and beside him is a small boy - the Š	innkeeper's son. "That's him," shouts the boy, Š	pointing his finger accusingly at you. 

	The innkeeper vouches to the nervous lieutenant that Š	you are a journeyman and not the creature who has Š	paralysed Hikas with a reign of terror. The Š	lieutenant relaxes a little and sheathes his sword.
	He shouts to a unit of his guardsmen who are grouped Š	outside to form into a column and get ready to march, Š	then he turns to you and asks you to accompany him.
