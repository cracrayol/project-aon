	By the skill of her crew and helmsman, the ÈPride of ä	SommerlundÈ enters the Bukimi Channel and picks up a ä	prevailing wind which propels her swiftly away from ä	the pirate raiders. Soon the enemy ships have ä	disappeared beyond the distant horizon. When Raker is ä	sure that they have abandoned the chase, he praises ä	his first mate and crew and promises that tonight ä	they can look forward to a double rum ration as ä	reward for their skilful seamanship. 

	As the ship navigates the narrow strait dividing ä	these two Lakuri islands, you pass close by the fire-ä	blackened ruins of a beach settlement which nestles ä	in a bay overshadowed by cliffs. It is Kita Cove, ä	formerly the secret base from where Captain Khadro ä	launched his pirate fleet. As you stare at the ä	charred remnants of his settlement, you try to ä	imagine what it must have looked like before the ä	encampment was consumed by the tremendous fireball ä	that was to seal its doom. 
	
	A mile beyond Kita Cove, the strait becomes narrower ä	at a place where it passes between two overhanging ä	cliffs. Paoll is sure that he can navigate safely ä	through this channel, but his confidence is shaken ä	when the lookout suddenly screams a warning: ä	"Whirlpool ahead!" 
	
	When you catch sight of the swirling, foaming water, ä	you sense immediately that this is not a natural ä	phenomenon: this watery vortex is the result of evil ä	sorcery.
