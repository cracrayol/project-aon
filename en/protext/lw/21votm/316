	You magnify your vision and detect that there are ä	violent thermal air currents swirling between the ä	mountain peaks. You detect that these are the result ä	of the dry air currents from the Bavari Hills meeting ä	with the humid jungle air of the southern reaches. ä	You warn Yranai but he seems unconcerned:

	"It may get a little rough but ÈSimoomÈ is built to ä	take it," he says with bravado, and he bangs his fist ä	on the handrail that runs around the rim of the ä	basket, as if to demonstrate his craft's sturdy ä	workmanship. When a section of the handrail ä	immediately falls away and is lost in the mountains ä	below, it does not readily inspire your confidence in ä	this craft or its pilot. Sheepishly, Yranai plays ä	with the valves of the engine and the balloon drifts ä	to the east, towards some more distant but lesser ä	peaks where the air is calmer. He gives you a wry ä	grin and you give thanks to Kai and Ishir that he has
	heeded your warning.
