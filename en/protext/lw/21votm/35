	You are aware that something unusual is happening the ä	moment you open your eyes, for you can hear the ä	excited chatterings of crewmen and marines who are ä	pacing about the deck directly above your cabin. ä	Quickly you rise from your bunk and go aloft to ä	investigate the commotion and, to your surprise, you ä	discover that the waters around the ship are stained ä	blood red. The transformation has been caused by ä	millions of tiny fish, a vast shoal of scarlet Trarta ä	who, like the ÈPride of SommerlundÈ, have sought ä	shelter here overnight in this secluded cove. 

	Captain Raker permits his men to spend an hour or two ä	fishing for Trarta. They are a delicacy, and they ä	will serve to supplement the crew's basic provisions ä	of salted meat and biscuit. By noon the Trarta shoal ä	have left in search of deeper reaches and clarity ä	returns to the turquoise waters of the cove, ä	revealing a new and interesting discovery. Resting on ä	the sandy floor of the cove, twenty feet below the ä	ship's keel, lie the remains of a Bautarian galleon. ä	Oriah is fascinated by the wreck and she asks Captain ä	Raker if she may be permitted to dive down and search ä	its shattered hold. The Captain has no objections, so ä	long as she is back on board within the hour. Oriah ä	is clearly excited by the prospect of what she may ä	discover aboard the wreck and, as she gets ready for ä	her dive, she asks if you would like to accompany ä	her.
