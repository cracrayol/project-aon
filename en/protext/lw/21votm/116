	You inch open the door and see a tall, lean, grey-Š	haired old man standing outside in the corridor. He Š	wears the silvery grey robes of a magician and his Š	broad facial features are unmistakably Kakushian. 
	
	"Forgive me for disturbing you at this hour," he Š	says, politely, "but I felt compelled to make your Š	acquaintance. My name is Rhous. I am journeyman to Š	the Magicians Guild of Nikesa. I sensed a époweré Š	within this room and I thought, perhaps, that you Š	might be a fellow student of sorcery. Am I correct ?"
	
	Your sixth sense tells you that this old magician is Š	genuine - he is who he claims to be. Your common Š	sense tells you that he is also incredibly nosey!


	If you wish to tell him to go away and leave you Š	alone, turn to  â137â

	If you choose to talk with him further, turn to  â310â
