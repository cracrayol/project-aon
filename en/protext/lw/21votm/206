	You veer off the main road and lead the way along Š	this narrow dirt track as it winds a tortuous route Š	into the hills. For several minutes you climb this Š	trail until it ends abruptly at a boulder-strewn Š	plateau that commands a magnificent view of the coast Š	and surrounding land. Far below you can see a cluster Š	of tiny yellow lights moving through the darkness. Š	They are the torches carried by your pursuers and you Š	watch intently as these flickering specks of light Š	draw closer to the place where the hill track meets Š	the coast road. You are praying to Ishir that the Š	riders will ignore the track and continue along the Š	road, for this plateau is a dead end; the track is Š	the only way to approach or leave here on horseback.
	
	Suddenly Sligh taps you on the shoulder and points to Š	a dark shape at the centre of the plateau. At first Š	glance it looks like a pit, but when you magnify your Š	night vision you see that it is a flight of rough-Š	hewn steps which descend into the solid rock.
		
	If you wish to investigate these steps, turn to  â174â
	
	If you choose to ignore them and remain where you Š	are, turn to  â114â
