	The owner is sorry to see you and your companions Š	leave the inn, but you simply refuse to accept his Š	proposal and he will not lower his price. You collect Š	your horses and walk them down to the beach where you Š	find a place to pitch camp among some sand dunes Š	overlooking the picturesque bay. Oswin settles the Š	horses while you help Sligh and Ernan to build a fire Š	from driftwood. While you are foraging for wood, you Š	stumble upon some strange pink-leaved plants growing Š	along the edge of the beach.
