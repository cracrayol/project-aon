	"There's no such place!" says the rogue, and his eyes Š	widen with fear. "By the gods! He does not know the Š	name of his own capital!" gasps one of his Š	companions. His mouth drops open and he fumbles to Š	unsheathe his sword. Suddenly it seems that everyone Š	in the tavern is gripped by an inexplicable madness. Š	The rogue pulls a dagger from his belt and attempts Š	to stab you, but you turn his clumsy thrust aside Š	with your forearm and knock him to the floor as you Š	leap out of your seat. Two of the others try to Š	strike you simultaneously with their swords and you Š	duck below their blades. They strike each other and Š	fall back, screaming and clutching at their wounds. A Š	thrown bottle catches you a glancing blow to the head Š	as you run for the door (lose 2 ENDURANCE points), Š	but you manage to pull it open and escape into the Š	darkening street without further injury. However, to Š	your dismay you discover that your horse Jhani has Š	disappeared. Two men brandishing swords appear in the Š	doorway behind you and swiftly you sprint along the Š	street. You use your Kai camouflage skills to evade Š	them and they quickly give up the chase.
