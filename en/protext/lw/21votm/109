	Shocked by this mental intrusion, you dig your heels Š	into Jheni's flanks and urge the old mare to the Š	gallop. The elder dodges aside as your horse bolts Š	forward and the Vakeros guards along the palisade Š	loose off their arrows. They whistle past you on all Š	sides yet, in the near-darkness, fail to find their Š	mark. Keeping yourself pressed low against your Š	horse's neck, you steer her around the perimeter of Š	the palisade and into a field of tall bamboo where Š	quickly you disappear from sight. 
	
	It is dark when finally rein Jheni to a halt. You Š	dismount and tend to the hundreds of tiny cuts and Š	abrasions she has sustained to her legs, caused by Š	the sharp bamboo stalks. Rather than push on in the Š	dark and have your horse sustain more injuries, you Š	camp here for the night. Unfortunately, the bamboo Š	fields of Dessi are notorious for their infestations Š	of biting mosquitoes, and you spend most of the long Š	night fending them off: lose 3 ENDURANCE points. Š	Also, unless you possess the discipline of Grand Š	Huntmastery, you must now eat a Meal or lose a Š	further 3 ENDURANCE points.

	In the early morning light you are able to lead your Š	horse out of the bamboo field and find your way back Š	onto the road to Hikas.
