	As you step into this shop you are hit by a heady ä	cocktail of powerful smells: metal polish, corrosive ä	acid, and rust. You cough to clear your throat of the ä	sickly taste left by these noisome aromas, and ä	suddenly the owner appears in a doorway at the back ä	of the shop. He thinks that are trying to attract his ä	attention.

	He notes that you are a warrior and so he lifts the ä	lid on a large display counter so that you may ä	inspect his weaponry. Each one is inlaid with finest ä	silver and bears a neatly written price tag:
	
	           BROADSWORD       8 Gold Crowns
	           WARHAMMER        7 Gold Crowns
	           DAGGER           3 Gold Crowns
	           AXE              8 Gold Crowns
	           SHORT SWORD      4 Gold Crowns
	           ARROWS           1 Gold Crown (each)

	If you wish to purchase one of more of the above ä	weapons, adjust your ÈAction ChartÈ accordingly.
