	The young ticket seller is sad to see the look of ä	disappointment on your face when you discover that ä	you do not have enough money for the caravan fare to ä	Bavari. She whispers in the ear of her father, one of ä	the owners, and with a shrug of his shoulders he ä	consents to his daughter's request. The young girl ä	beckons you to approach her table and she offers to ä	accept one of your weapons or two of your backpack ä	items in exchange for a place aboard a passenger ä	wagon. (Erase either 1 Weapon or 2 Backpack Items ä	from your ÈAction ChartÈ)
	
	The young girl smiles as she paints a dot of ä	indelible crimson ink upon the back of your right ä	hand to indicate that you have paid your fare. A few ä	minutes later, an outrider comes cantering down the ä	line of parked wagons announcing to everyone that the ä	caravan will depart in five minutes time. With mixed ä	feelings of trepidation and excitement, you take a ä	seat aboard one of the spacious passenger wagons and ä	make yourself as comfortable as you can for the long ä	journey ahead.
