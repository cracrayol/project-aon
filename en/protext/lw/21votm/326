	You fire your arrow at the leader and it strikes his Š	wing and breaks the bone, causing the creature to Š	spiral out of control. Yranai yells and cheers but Š	his triumphant cries are premature. You watch aghast Š	as the itikar collides with the balloon and stabs its Š	talons into the canopy. In its desperation to Š	survive, it shreds the cloth to ribbons before it Š	falls away and plummets to its doom in the Š	timberlands below.

	The impact of the bird hitting the canopy knocks you Š	off your feet. Yranai falls on top of you and, for a Š	few nerve-racking seconds, you lie entangled at the Š	bottom of the basket as the balloon rapidly loses Š	altitude. When you pull yourself up and peer over the Š	rim, you see the trees of the lower mountain slopes Š	rising towards you at a dizzying speed. Yranai looks Š	up to see shreds of cloth trailing from the punctured Š	canopy above and the sight proves too much for him: Š	he faints. Hurriedly you haul his frail body over Š	your shoulder. Then you place one foot on the rim of Š	the basket and get ready to make a desperate leap Š	away from this doomed balloon as the tops of the 

Š	mountain pines come into view.
