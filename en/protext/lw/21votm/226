	Your Kai sixth sense informs you that the whirlpool ä	is being created by a powerful entity, a creature ä	that is hiding somewhere amongst the foliage which ä	blankets the overhanging cliff. From its high vantage ä	point it is pouring its evil energy down into the ä	channel below, causing the vortex which now threatens ä	to drag the ÈPride of SommerlundÈ to a deep, watery ä	grave.

	Drawing upon your New Order mastery, you summon a ä	wind to assail the clifftop. Instantly a gale arises ä	which whips through the undergrowth, sending clouds ä	of dirt and torn foliage whirling high into the air. ä	Soon you sense that the unseen creature is being ä	forced to retreat in the face of this barrage and, as ä	it abandons its attack, so the whirlpool ahead ceases ä	to spin violently.

	As the waters of the channel return to normal, Raker
	commands his crew to unfurl every remaining square ä	inch of canvas. They catch the prevailing winds and   ä	carry you swiftly away from this sinister place.
