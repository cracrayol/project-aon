	You press yourself flat against your horse's neck and Š	listen with dread as the archer's arrow buzzes Š	towards you like and angry hornet. Then you feel an Š	agonizing pain in your side as its razor-sharp tip Š	penetrates your rib cage: lose 5 ENDURANCE points. 

	A wave of nausea and dizziness washes over you, Š	making you relinquish your grip on the rope reins. You Š	fight against the mounting pain to stay conscious but Š	this is one battle you do not win. Darkness engulfs Š	your vision and, as you lose consciousness, you slip Š	and fall from your horse to crash upon the dusty Š	avenue. 	
	
	You regain consciousness almost immediately and Š	manage to drag yourself into a kneeling position. The Š	marines race past on their horses, but they have seen Š	you fall and they rein their steeds to a halt just as Š	quickly as they are able. Gritting your teeth against Š	the expected pain, you jerk the arrow from your side Š	and hurl it away. Your natural Kai curing skills help Š	to deaden the agony of your wound and slow the Š	bleeding, but they cannot prevent the archer who Š	fired the arrow from placing a second shaft to his Š	bow. Your sixth senses scream a warning and you look Š	up to see him standing less than twenty yards away. Š	Coolly he raises his bow and smiles as he gets ready Š	to finish you once and for all.
