	As you stoop to help a wounded crewman who has fallen 
	by your side, you see the spider-creature leap from ä	the prow of the attacking ship to land in the ä	rigging, several feet above. You are about to shout a ä	warning to Captain Raker when there is a tremendous ä	crash. The ship lurches violently and you are thrown ä	across the deck.

	Pick a number from the ÈRandom Number TableÈ. If you ä	possess the discipline of Grand Huntmastery, add ‚2‚ to ä	the number you have picked.


	If your total score is now ‚0‚ - ‚3‚, turn to  ‚112‚

	If it is  ‚4‚ - ‚7‚, turn to  ‚9‚

	If it is  ‚8‚  or higher, turn to  ‚259‚
