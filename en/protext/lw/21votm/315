	You strike your killing blow and the Otokh emits a Š	loud and terrible shriek. Its great body convulses, Š	and hissing sparks cascade from its limbs and maw as Š	slowly it relinquishes its grip upon the masthead. Š	You watch with awe as the creature plummets through Š	the rigging and crashes down upon the deck rail with Š	terrific force. Five enemy raiders are crushed to Š	death and several more are consigned to a watery Š	grave when they become entangled in the creature's  Š	legs. They are dragged screaming to their doom as the Š	Otokh rolls through the shattered ship's rail and Š	disappears beneath the foaming waves.

	The death of the Otokh sends a wave of panic coursing Š	through the enemy's ranks and soon they begin to Š	falter and fall back to their own vessel. The enemy Š	leader curses and screams as his men swarm aboard, Š	and you hear him threaten to personally tear the Š	throat from any warrior who refuses to fight on. This Š	threat appears to work for the raiders cease their Š	retreat and begin instead to regroup in preparation Š	for another attack. You watch as the leader leaves Š	the protection of his ship's forecastle and takes his Š	place at the head of his troops, ready to lead this Š	second assault.
