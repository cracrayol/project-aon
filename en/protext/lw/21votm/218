	The balloon lurches away from the mountainside yet Š	the effect of your heroic effort is dramatically Š	short-lived. The crosswind proves to be stronger than Š	your Kai mastery. Cursing your ill fortune, you brace Š	yourself against the inside of the basket as the Š	outcrop looms nearer. Moments later, there is the Š	sound of ripping cloth and you are jolted off your Š	feet. Yranai falls on top of you and you lie Š	entangled together at the bottom of the basket. Then Š	the balloon is suddenly whisked away from the outcrop Š	by a second crosswind.

	You disentangle yourself from the old man and Š	struggle to your feet. You can feel the balloon is Š	rapidly losing altitude and, when you peer over the Š	rim of the basket, you see the trees of the lower Š	mountain slopes rising towards you at a dizzying Š	speed. Yranai pulls himself up beside you, but when Š	he sees shreds of cloth trailing from the punctured Š	canopy above, he faints and collapses. Hurriedly you Š	haul his frail body over your shoulder. Then you Š	place one foot on the rim of the basket and get ready Š	to make a desperate leap away from this doomed Š	balloon as the top of the mountain pines come clearly Š	into view.
