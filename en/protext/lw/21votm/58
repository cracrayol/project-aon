	The owner sympathises with you. He does not want to ä	lose your custom and so he tries to strike a deal. He ä	says that he would be willing to accept two of your ä	backpack items instead of the remaining six gold ä	crowns.


	If you agree to his deal, erase any two backpack ä	items from your ÈAction ChartÈ (excluding Meals) and ä	turn to  ‚333‚

	If you do not agree to his deal, turn to  ‚224‚
