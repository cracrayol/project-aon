	There is no door to the cabin and you are able to ä	swim through the opening with ease. Inside you ä	discover very little that has survived since this ä	galleon fell prey to a violent storm one year ago. ä	With the tip of your weapon you sift through the mire ä	of decomposing wood, rust, and rotten fabric that ä	lays like a thick muddy blanket on the floor of this ä	cabin. It is a laborious process and in return for ä	your efforts you discover 9 Gold Crowns and a Dagger.

	Through the hole in the roof of the cabin you glimpse ä	Oriah ascending to the surface for air. Satisfied ä	that there is nothing else of value aboard this ä	wreck, you leave the cabin and return to the ÈPride of ä	Sommerlund.È
