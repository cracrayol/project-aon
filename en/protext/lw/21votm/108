	Together with Paoll and a party of five armed Š	marines, you row ashore in the ship's longboat. With Š	weapons drawn, you and your search party sift through Š	the ruins of Khadro's encampment but find few items Š	of any practical value. There are several tracks Š	which have been made by the creatures you glimpsed Š	earlier, but they all lead away into the surrounding Š	jungle and you can no longer detect their presence. 
	
	Mindful of the risk you are taking simply by being Š	here on the island, away from the ship, you signal to Š	the men to return to the longboat. As you are Š	descending the beach, you trip accidentally upon Š	something half-buried in the black sand. Closer Š	inspection reveals it to be a fist-sized ball of iron Š	that has been crafted into the shape of a human Š	skull. (If you wish to keep this Iron Skull, record Š	it on your Action Chart as a Special Item which you Š	carry in the pocket of your tunic.)
