	With a rousing cheer, the second wave of enemy ä	raiders follow their leader and leap aboard the ÈPride ä	of SommerlundÈ. The ship's crew and the marines have ä	suffered many casualties and they are now too weak ä	and exhausted to be able to repel this renewed ä	assault. You know that you must act swiftly if you ä	are to avert a disaster.
	
	Steeling yourself for what must be done, you shoulder ä	your bow and unsheathe a weapon. Then you leap from ä	the rigging as the enemy leader passes below the ä	mainmast. You hit the armoured warrior feet first and ä	slam him to the deck, but he quickly recovers from ä	your surprise attack and, in the ensuing struggle, he ä	manages to kick the weapon from your hand. 
	
	"Leave him to me!" he screams, warning off his  	
	henchmen who are poised to rush forward and cut you ä	down. Slowly he unsheathes his scimitar and, with a ä	sneer fixed to his cruel lips, he raises the blade in ä	readiness to strike a mighty blow to your head.
