	Your arrow sinks into the creature's chest and makes Š	it howl with pain, yet it does not deflect the beast. Š	The sheer momentum of its attack is propelling it Š	towards you. Hurriedly you drop your bow and reach to Š	your weapon, but it has barely cleared its scabbard Š	when the creature is suddenly upon you, its vile Š	breath hot in your face. You are slammed against the Š	wall by the impact of the collision (lose 2 ENDURANCE Š	points) and momentarily stunned, but still you Š	manage to duck its slashing claws which rake deep Š	grooves in the wall above your head. With a swift Š	twist of your body you unpin yourself from the wall Š	and create the vital space you need in order to wield Š	your weapon against this determined and terrible foe.
