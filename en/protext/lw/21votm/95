	The owner ushers you to a table and his wife appears Š	carrying four plates, each stacked high with a mound Š	of fresh vegetables and poached fish. While you enjoy Š	this delicious meal, you listen to the marines Š	talking about their homes and families back in Kirlu, Š	their past tours of duty, and their fond memories of 
	Sergeant Dryan. You sense that each man, in his own Š	way, is grieving the loss of his brave young Š	sergeant. Soon their jovial conversation has become Š	tinged with melancholy and homesickness and you Š	become a little worried by their mood of sadness. To
	raise their morale you ask the owner to bring them Š	each a measure of his finest brew. Gladly he accepts Š	your order and pours each man a flagon of strong dark Š	ale. This proves most effective in curing their Š	melancholy for it is so strong that it renders all Š	four of them unconscious! With the owner's help you Š	carry the marines to their beds and then return to Š	enjoy a small glass of ale in his company. A little Š	while later an old woman enters the inn clutching a Š	basket filled with bones, dice, and other fortune-Š	telling paraphernalia. She offers to tell you the Š	secrets of your future in return for 1 Gold Crown.
