	You spend an hour enjoying the carnival spirit of the Š	beach festival before you return to your horse and go Š	in search of a place to stay for the night.	You ride Š	along a street running parallel to the beach, and Š	enter the courtyard of a large two-storey hostel with Š	stables. A young boy takes your horse's reins and Š	leads him away to an enclosure at the side of this Š	brightly-painted building, and you enter the hostel's Š	front door to find it is empty. It seems that Š	everyone in down at the beach this evening. Then you Š	hear a noise from beyond an open doorway and a Š	balding man appears. He rubs his blood-shot eyes and Š	yawns, revealing a mouthful of gold teeth. You ask if Š	he has a room for the night and lazily he nods his Š	head.

	"I've two types of room and service," he says, Š	"There's Standard and there's Best. Standard costs 2 Š	Gold Crowns a night and you don't get no food. Best Š	costs 4 Gold Crowns and you get lots of food in the Š	morning."

	If you decide to buy a Best room, turn to  â138â
