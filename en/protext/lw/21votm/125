	Upon the instant you utter the ancient number there Š	is a creaking of stone and the marble slab begins to Š	descend slowly into the floor. As it falls it reveals Š	another chamber where an ugly bronze idol rests upon Š	a plinth of rough-hewn agate. Fixed into a hollow in Š	the chest of the idol is a shimmering green emerald Š	as large as your fist. Cautiously you sniff the stale Š	air of this secret chamber and your Kai senses detect Š	the foul, lingering odour of evil sorcery.
