	You usher the marines into your room and lock the Š	door to prevent the tavernkeeper from entering. Then Š	one by one you leave by the window and climb up onto Š	the roof. Hidden by the darkness and by a low parapet Š	wall which encircles the tavern's upper floor, you Š	stay here and observe as more than a hundred City Š	Guardsmen round up all the foreign merchants and Š	crewmen who are lodging at the quayside taverns. Š	These innocent men are then made to form up into a Š	long column before they are marched away towards the Š	Funtal's Castle. When dawn breaks over the harbour, Š	this normally busy trading centre is unusually quiet. Š	The only people you can see going about their Š	business are native Bir Rabalonians.

	When you can no longer see any City Guardsmen in the Š	harbour, you re-enter the tavern and hurry down to Š	the taproom. Here you find Kol, the Casiornian Š	merchant, enjoying a large plateful of meat and Š	cheese. With a wide grin he tells you that he has Š	spent a very comfortable night hiding in the kitchen Š	cellar.
