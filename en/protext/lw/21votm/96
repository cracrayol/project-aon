	You walk to the south side of the market where it is Š	less populated. Here, sandwiched between a warehouse Š	and a storage shed, you discover a small lodging Š	house. A sign in the window says that there are clean Š	rooms available and so you enter to enquire about the Š	price. You are greeted by a woman whose almond-shaped Š	eyelids tell you that she is from Chai, a land far Š	away in Southern Magnamund. She tells you that a room Š	here for the night will cost you 3 Gold Crowns, a Š	price which also includes a morning meal. 
	

	If you possess 3 Gold Crowns and wish to stay here Š	for the night, turn to  â183â
	
	If you do not, turn to  â155â
