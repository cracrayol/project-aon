	You leave the lodging house and stand outside in the ä	busy market square. While you are watching the city's ä	lamplighters going about their evening duties, you ä	contemplate your situation. You know that you are ä	going to need to raise some money if you are to reach ä	Elzian without incurring great delays. In fact, the ä	success of your mission could hinge upon it. With this ä	thought foremost in your mind, you hurry across the ä	square and enter a rough-looking hostelry opposite. It ä	is home to several rogues and varlets who spend most ä	of their nightimes drinking and gambling. You join in ä	one of their dice games and, using your magnakai skill ä	of nexus, you manage to win 10 Gold Crowns from them ä	before they suspect something is wrong and they demand ä	you leave.
	
	You go back to the lodging house where the Chai ä	landlady is disappointed to see you return. She is ä	about to tell you to go away when you place 3 Gold ä	Crowns into her hand, payment for one night's board ä	and breakfast (you may add a total of 7 Gold Crowns to ä	your ÈAction ChartÈ: your winnings less your lodging ä	fee).
