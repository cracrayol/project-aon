	You use your discipline to will the spider to return Š	to its nest. The arachnid obeys your mental command Š	and scurries away to disappear through a crack in the Š	uneven bamboo floor. Your close encounter with this 
	potentially deadly spider plays on your mind and you Š	find it impossible to go back to sleep (lose 2 Š	ENDURANCE points due to fatigue). 
	
	At first light you gather together your equipment and Š	go down to the paddock to collect your horse. The Š	hostel-keeper calls you from the kitchen window and Š	holds up a large plate of food that is your Š	breakfast. The memory of the Zuath crawling up your Š	leg invades your mind and the thought robs you of Š	your appetite. You wave the man farewell and then Š	mount your horse and ride away across the courtyard.
