	When the dust settles you see that the Koneshi Pass Š	is now blocked and completely impassable. You shout Š	to the marines on the other side to let them know Š	that you are safe, and you hear them calling back, Š	but even with your acute Kai sense of hearing you are Š	unable to make out clearly what it is that they are Š	shouting.

	However, by drawing upon your magnakai skill of Š	divination you are able to make telepathic contact Š	with Sligh. By way of mental commands and suggestions Š	you tell him to lead his comrades back to Bir Rabalou Š	where they are to sell their horses to raise the Š	money they will need to buy passage home aboard a Š	trading ship. Sligh is unable to answer you Š	telepathically, but you sense that he will comply Š	with your suggestions. Wary of the risk of further Š	landslides, you turn your horse around and ride off Š	along the open mountain trail towards the south.
