	The Deathstalker's mate howls with pain and terror as Š	your fatal blow pierces her evil heart. She
	stumbles backwards, slashing at her own chest with Š	her razor claws in a frenzied madness of anger and Š	frustration. Then, with a final gurgling cry, death Š	claims her and she crashes down into the dense Š	foliage and is still. Slowly the noises of the jungle Š	return as the noctural animals of this Old Kingdom Š	sense that the terrible threat of her presense has Š	passed.

	The sun rises over the jungle and lights this steamy, Š	humid morning. By the growing light you dig a grave Š	in the soft earth and lay the remains of the Š	Deathstalker's mate to rest here, among the ruins of Š	this ancient settlement. Then you offer up a prayer Š	to the God Kai for having bestowed upon you strength Š	and courage enough to triumph over this creature of Š	evil, before you mount your horse and set off along Š	the jungle trail to Elzian.
