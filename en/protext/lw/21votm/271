	The old man places his hand over the torn cloth, ä	mumbles a few words, and when he removes it you see ä	that the fibres have knitted together and your cloak ä	is now as good as new. At once your magnakai senses ä	tell you that he has used the Brotherhood spell - ä	ÈMendÈ - to repair your garment.
	
	"Just a little trick I learned in Toran," he says ä	jocularly. Then he raises his box-like contraption ä	and sighs: "Alas, t'is a pity I can't use the same ä	trick to fix this convexor. I was never much good ä	with machines." He looks at the box and then at you ä	and a flicker of recognition passes across his ä	wizened face. "You're Sommlending arn't you?" he ä	says, and then he moves a little closer and inspects ä	your tunic and cloak. "By the bells of Teph! You're a ä	Kai! Well, well, bless my soul!" And with this the ä	old man begins to reminisce about the part he played ä	in the Darklands War, how the peoples of Northern ä	Magnamund owe their lives to your illustrious leader ä	- Lone Wolf - and how appreciative he is of the Kai's
	tireless fight against the forces of Naar. It is ä	clear by his enthusiasm that he is honoured to have ä	made your acquaintance. When finally he finishes his ä	gushing eulogy he offers to buy you an evening meal.
