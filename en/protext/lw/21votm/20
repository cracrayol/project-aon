	As you leave the tavern and march with the lieutenant Š	at the head of his column of guardsmen, you ask him Š	if you are being arrested. After all, you have not
	broken the curfew. He smiles and confides in you that Š	he was hoping you would agree to help him to track Š	down the creature. 
	
	"The skills and special powers of the Kai are Š	legendary," he says, "You may succeed where we have  Š	failed. Will you help us find this beast before it Š	kills again?"

	Before you can give your answer, a terrible shriek Š	echoes through the empty streets. A woman standing on Š	the balcony of a tall building nearby, leans over the Š	parapet and calls out to the lieutenant and his men.
	"Down by the river," she shouts, and she points over Š	the rooftops to where the shriek was heard, "The Š	fiend...it's struck!"

	"Quick men!" yells the lieutenant, "Follow me. If Š	we're swift we may catch the beast this night."
