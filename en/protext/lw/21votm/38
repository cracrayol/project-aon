	You are climbing the stairs to your room on the first Š	floor when an old man bumps into you on the landing. Š	He is wearing thick spectacles and he is scrutinizing Š	a strange box-like device made from cubes and tubes Š	of iron, quartz and brass. Part of this device snags Š	your cloak and rips it. He apologises profusely and Š	offers to mend the tear in your cloak. As you look Š	into his bespectacaled eyes your magnakai senses Š	detect a faint aura of magic.


	If you wish to let him mend your cloak, turn to  â271â
	
	If you decide to decline his offer, you may go to Š	your room by turning to  â213â
