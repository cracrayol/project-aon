	Yranai keeps an equal distance between the two ä	mountains as his craft approaches the gap. But as it ä	drifts nearer, you feel the air temperature beginning ä	to fall rapidly as you get closer to the snowy peaks. ä	Suddenly the basket is buffeted by rising air ä	currents and you have to grip the handrail tightly ä	with both hands to stay on your feet.

	Your magnakai tracking skills warn you that the ä	balloon is in the grip of thermal air currents that ä	are swirling between the peaks. These are being ä	created by the coming together of dry air masses from ä	the Bavari Hills and humid jungle air from the Dessi ä	uplands. You warn Yranai but he seems unconcerned. ä	"It may get a little rough," he says, as he struggles ä	to keep his spectacles from being shaken off his ä	nose, "But ÈSimoomÈ is built to take it. She'll she us ä	through!" 
	
	As if in defiance of his words, the basket lurches ä	violently as the balloon is hit by a strong ä	crosswind. Yranai is unable to reach the engine ä	valves to compensate for this sudden change of ä	direction and, to your mounting horror, you see the ä	basket drifting towards a jagged outcrop of rock.
