	Rhous picks up the skull and weighs it in his hand ä	before examining its pitted surface. You can tell by ä	his sour expression that he is disappointed: he had ä	hoped for something more exceptional than this. After ä	a few moments he offers you 8 Gold Crowns. You haggle ä	with him and finally you settle on a sum of 10 Gold ä	Crowns.

	[If, in addition to the Iron Skull, you also possess ä	any of the other items, Rhous would be willing to pay ä	you 20 Gold Crowns for the Siyen Crown and 30 Gold ä	Crowns for the Kutyan Emerald. Be sure to amend the ä	details of your ÈAction ChartÈ before continuing your ä	adventure.]
