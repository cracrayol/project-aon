	Reluctantly the marines follow as you descend the ä	stairs. The moment you set foot in the taproom you ä	are surrounded by armed guards and made to hand over ä	your weapons (delete all normal weapons from your ä	ÈAction ChartÈ; you need not delete your Kai Weapon ä	which you keep hidden beneath your cloak). Once you ä	and your companions have been disarmed, you are ä	herded towards the counter to join more than two ä	dozen others who are of foreign nationality. The ä	officer in charge of the armed guards then strides to ä	the middle of the taproom floor and proceeds to ä	inform you in an imperious tone that you are to be ä	taken to the Funtal's castle where your trading ä	papers and travel documents will be scrutinized. The ä	others, who all appear to be traders and merchants, ä	are outraged when they hear this decree. They protest ä	loudly and many refuse to leave the tavern. They say ä	that it is all just a cynical ploy by the Funtal to ä	confiscate their cargoes.
	
	Kol appears by your side and he whispers to you to ä	follow him. As the Funtal's guards move in and ä	grapple with the angry merchants, you and the marines ä	slip away with Kol and hide in the cellar below the ä	tavern's kitchen. An hour later, as dawn is breaking, ä	the tavern falls silent and you emerge from your ä	hiding place to discover that it is now completely ä	empty.
