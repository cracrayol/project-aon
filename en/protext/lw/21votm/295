	The incident at the tavern and the loss of your horse 
	leave you feeling angry	and confused. For more than Š	an hour you walk the dark deserted streets of Hikas Š	as you struggle to make sense of what has happened. Š	You are passing a junction where the cobblestoned Š	street join with a larger avenue, when suddenly you Š	hear the approaching tramp of booted feet. A stern Š	but anxious voice calls out, commanding you to halt, Š	and when you peer into the darkness you see a dozen Š	Vakeros militiamen. They are armed with spears and Š	throwing nets, and they are standing in a line Š	abreast to seal off the avenue.


	If you wish to obey the militiamen and remain Š	standing where you are, turn to  â105â

	If you wish to attempt to evade them, turn to  â36â
