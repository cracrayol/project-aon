You ignore his order and continue running, Š	making your good your escape from the quayside by Š	means of an alleyway. As you rush towards the end of Š	this narrow passage, the way path suddenly blocked by Š	three city guardsmen. Startled by the unexpected Š	sight of a northlander running straight at them, they Š	draw their swords and get ready to cut you down.
