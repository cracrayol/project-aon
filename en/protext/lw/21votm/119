	You say farewell to the three marines and wish them a ä	swift and safe journey home to Sommerlund. Then you ä	leave the tavern with Kol and make your way quickly ä	to his ship which is moored at the end of the quay. ä	Two of the Funtal's guards are patrolling the ä	quayside but they do not challenge you as you board ä	Kol's vessel. They seem only interested in foreign ä	traders who are entering the harbour rather than ä	those making a hasty departure. The Vassagonians who ä	man the ÈDesert JewelÈ seem a friendly crew, and they ä	welcome Kol's return with cheerful humour. He in turn ä	treats them like sons and it is clear from the way ä	they converse that he is a very popular owner.

	The ship sets sail at noon and sails swiftly ä	southwards with a benevolent wind filling its ä	triangular sail. Kol expects the ÈDesert JewelÈ to take ä	a day and a half to navigate the two hundred and ä	sixty miles of coastal water between Bir Rabalou and ä	Bisutan. He suggests that you relax and enjoy the ä	voyage, yet despite the fair weather and jovial ä	company you are disturbed by a growing sense of ä	unease. You spend your time on deck for the holds and ä	cabins are filled to the brim with cargo. The only ä	shelter from the sun which scorches the open deck is ä	a makeshift spread of canvas near the stern. You are ä	lying here in the shade when, late in the afternoon, ä	you sense a storm brewing on the horizon.
