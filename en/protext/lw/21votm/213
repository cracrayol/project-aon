	You find and enter your room, and then you lock the ä	door behind you. Exhausted after your ordeal at the ä	gladiatorial arena, you unshoulder your backpack and ä	collapse on the bed without bothering to undress. ä	Yet, despite your fatigue, you cannot seem to fall ä	asleep. For more than an hour you lie staring at the ä	cobwebbed beams of the ceiling as, in your mind's ä	eye, you recall some of the dramatic events of your ä	journey so far. You picture Oriah being carried away ä	by the itikar, the deaths of Fernant and Sergeant ä	Dryan aboard the ÈPride of SommerlundÈ, and the faces ä	of the three marines who travelled with you from Cape ä	Kabar. The images and memories of these people help ä	strengthen your resolve to reach Elzian and you ä	decide that you will set out for Hikas first thing in ä	the morning.

	Before you fall asleep, unless you possess Grand ä	Huntmastery you must eat a Meal or lose 3 ENDURANCE ä	points.
