	Your arrow hits the creature's chest but it does not Š	penetrate deeply beyond its thick fur. Hurriedly you Š	drop your bow and reach to your weapon. It has barely Š	cleared its scabbard when the creature is suddenly Š	upon you, its vile breath hot in your face. You are Š	slammed against the wall by the impact of the attack Š	(lose 2 ENDURANCE points) and momentarily stunned, Š	but still you manage to duck its slashing claws which Š	rake deep grooves in the wall above your head. With a Š	swift twist of your body you unpin yourself and Š	create the vital space you need in order to wield Š	your weapon against this determined and terrible foe.
