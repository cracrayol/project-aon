	With the old magician draped over your shoulder, you ä	leap from the basket and plummet towards the ground. ä	As you fall, you utter the words of the Brotherhood ä	spell - ÈLevitationÈ - and instantly the spell enables 
	you to control the speed of your descent towards the ä	trees below. You see the balloon smash into the ä	timberland and, as you descend through the upper ä	branches of this pine forest, you brace yourself in ä	readiness for the moment when your feet touch the ä	ground. 
	
	Unfortunately, when you cast ÈLevitationÈ in mid-air, ä	you did not anticipate that the increased weight of ä	Yranai would have any effect on your control of this ä	spell. It is not until you are within twenty feet of ä	the ground that you realise that you are coming down ä	too fast. You attempt to compensate but it is too ä	late and you strike the rocky soil with a tremendous ä	jolt that knocks you unconscious.
