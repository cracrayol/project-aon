	You hand over seven crowns (erase these from your ä	ÈAction ChartÈ) to a young ticket seller and she paints ä	a dot of indelible crimson ink upon the back of your ä	right hand to indicate that you have paid your fare. ä	Displayed upon adjoining tables are dried foodstuffs ä	and other provisions for the journey. You may buy ä	some of this food if you wish, at a cost of 2 Gold ä	Crowns per Meal.

	A few minutes later an outrider comes cantering down ä	the line of parked wagons announcing to everyone that ä	the caravan will depart in five minutes time. With ä	mixed feelings of trepedation and excitement, you ä	take a seat aboard one of the spacious passenger ä	wagons and make yourself as comfortable as you can ä	for the long journey ahead.
