	The crowd are beginning to turn ugly. Judging by the Š	way they are looking at you it is clear that they Š	believe the thief lies. Rather than risk a Š	confrontation with them or the city militia, you Š	decide that perhaps in this instance discretion is Š	the better part of valour. You toss the stolen item Š	back at the thief and begrudgingly you tell him to Š	keep it (erase the first item you have recorded on Š	your Backpack Items list).

	The crowd immediately lose interest in what they now Š	believe is just another everyday street incident in Š	Bisutan. The thief sneers as he pockets your property Š	and then he turns and scurries away into the crowd, Š	like a rat entering a sewer.
