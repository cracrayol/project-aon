	Suddenly it seems that everyone in the tavern is Š	gripped by an inexplicable madness. The rogue pulls Š	his dagger free and attempts to stab you, but you Š	turn his clumsy thrust aside with your forearm and Š	knock him to the floor. Two of the others try to Š	strike you simultaneously with their swords and you Š	duck below their blades. They strike each other and Š	fall back, screaming and clutching at their wounds. A Š	thrown bottle catches you a glancing blow to the head Š	as you run for the door (lose 2 ENDURANCE points), Š	but you manage to pull it open and escape into the Š	darkening street without further injury. However, to Š	your dismay you discover that your horse Jhani has Š	disappeared. Two men brandishing swords appear in the Š	doorway behind you and swiftly you sprint along the Š	street. You use your Kai camouflage skills to evade Š	them and they quickly give up the chase.
