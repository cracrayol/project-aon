	You enjoy a peaceful night's sleep and you wake at Š	daybreak to the sounds of seagulls and the early Š	morning tide. On the floor beside your door is a tray Š	piled high with all manner of cooked meats, fresh Š	fruits and grilled fish. You eat a hearty breakfast
	and find that there is still enough left over for Š	another 2 Meals.

	After breakfast you gather up your equipment and go Š	down to the paddock to collect your horse. The Š	hostel-keeper waves farewell from the kitchen window Š	as you mount your horse and ride him away across the Š	courtyard.
