	As you stand in the market square, you are Š	continually jostled and bumped by the passing crowd Š	which is flowing around you. You are about to move Š	off when suddenly you feel something tugging at your Š	backpack. Glancing over your shoulder, you see a Š	suspicious young man running off through the crowd. Š	He is clutching something to his chest that you feel Š	sure he has just filched from your pack.
	
	
	If you wish to chase after this man, turn to â83â
	
	If you decide to let him go, turn to  â56â
