	You accompany the Captain back to ÈThe Pride of ä	SommerlundÈ where you are welcomed aboard by two men - ä	First Mate Paoll, and a fair-haired young man whose ä	blue surcoat is emblazoned with the scarlet anchor of ä	the Kirlundin Isles. 
	
	"My name's Dryan - Sergeant Dryan of the 1st ä	Kirlundin Marines," says the proud young man. "I've a  ä	dozen marines in my charge and we've been assigned a ä	tour of duty aboard this ship	for the duration of its ä	voyage south."
	
	Paoll is eager to show you to your cabin which is ä	situated at the stern, next to the Captain's ä	quarters, but you decline his offer. Instead you 
	speak further with Sergeant Dryan and learn that he ä	and his marines have been ordered aboard the ship by ä	King Ulnar. Dryan's instructions are to protect the ä	ship's cargo from the threat of pirate attack. At ä	first you are suspicious; in his briefing Lone Wolf ä	said nothing about an escort of marines. To determine ä	whether Dryan is telling the truth, you probe the ä	Sergeant's mind using your psychic Kai skills and ä	discover at once that he is genuine. He does not know ä	or suspect the true purpose of your journey. 
	"Well I'm glad to be sharing this voyage with you and ä	your men," you say, "it makes me feel much safer ä	knowing we have marines on board."
	You salute the Sergeant and he goes off to attend to ä	his men. The Captain Raker turns to his First Mate ä	and bellows:  "Alright, Paoll. Set the crew to work. ä	I want us to catch the ebb tide within the hour."
