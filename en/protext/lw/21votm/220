	Circling above a column of rocks are six large
	black-winged birds. You magnify your vision and Š	instantly you recognise them to be itikars - giant Š	Vassagonian eagles. The leader of this predatory Š	group has golden markings on his wings tips that Š	glint in the sun, giving them a metallic appearance, Š	and when he sees the balloon approaching he veers Š	away from the column. The others follow his lead and Š	all six come flying towards you in a wedge-shaped Š	formation.

	They fly past overhead and stare down at the balloon Š	with their cold black eyes. Then the leader turns Š	about and you sense that he intends to attack you on Š	his next pass. His companions form up behind him in a Š	line and he leads them in a steep dive.
	
	As he comes to within a hundred feet, he spreads his Š	razor-sharp talons and fixes his cruel eyes on the Š	balloon's vulnerable canopy.
