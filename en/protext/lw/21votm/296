	As you duck to avoid the onrushing missile, you Š	glimpse your arrow strike the archer in the chest and Š	knock him backwards to the ground. His arrow grazes Š	your cheek (lose 1 ENDURANCE point) as it whistles Š	past your head and then embeds itself in the dried Š	mud wall of a nearby building.
	
	For a few uncertain moments the marines believe that Š	you have been mortally wounded, but they are quick to Š	cheer when they see you get to your feet and come Š	running towards them. Sligh helps you to retrieve Š	your horse and quickly you remount him and gallop Š	along the avenue which leads out of this unfriendly Š	town.
