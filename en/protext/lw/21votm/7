	You tour the market and one stall in particular holds your Š	attention. It is run by a small and timid-looking man and Š	he offers you herbs and potions which he has gathered from Š	all over Magnamund. As you examine the hundreds of phials, Š	philtres and flasks that are layed out upon his stall, you Š	note there are many types of herbs that you have Š	encountered before, and some you have not. Of all his Š	selection, the following four interest you the most:
	
	POTION OF LAUMSPUR: restores 4 ENDURANCE points when 
	                    swallowed after combat.
	POTION OF ALETHER: increases COMBAT SKILL by 2 when 
	                   swallowed before combat (use only once) Š	POTION OF MUSTOW:  creates a foul choking gas when 
	                   released into the air.
	POTION OF SEBARIS: purifies contaminated water (use only 
	                   once).	

	Each of these potions cost 3 Gold Crowns.
