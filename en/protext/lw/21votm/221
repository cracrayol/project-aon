	You slip your purchase inside your backpack and then Š	bid farewell to the smiling herbalist before Š	returning to the middle of square. Here you stop for Š	a few minutes to watch a juggler. As you watch him Š	perform with clubs and daggers, you are continually Š	jostled and bumped by the crowd. You are about to Š	move off when suddenly you feel something tugging at Š	your back. Glancing over your shoulder, you see a Š	suspicious young man running away through the milling Š	crowd. He is clutching something to his chest that Š	you feel sure he has just filched from your backpack.
