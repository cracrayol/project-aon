	You rush back to the junction and continue along the Š	right alley until you reach a tree-lined plaza which Š	is bordered by expensive art emporiums. The militia Š	are examining their doors and windows for signs of a Š	forced entry but all of them look secure. Then your Š	eye is drawn to a grand temple on the far side of the Š	plaza. Its great stone door is closed, but a smaller Š	wooden door at the side has been torn off its hinges. Š	You magnify your vision and see that beyond the door Š	are a flight of stone steps which ascend to a Š	belltower.
	
	Cautiously you approach the shattered door. You Š	unsheathe your weapon and scan the darkened stairs Š	before silently you move up the steps. You have Š	climbed twenty steps when suddenly you hear a hideous Š	snickering growl and an icy chill runs the length of Š	your spine. There is an ominous creak of stone on Š	stone and a movement in the darkness above, then a Š	crashing fills your ears. Out of the darkness you see Š	a great marble statue come smashing down the narrow Š	stairway. It rapidly gathers speed as it tumbles end Š	over end towards you.
