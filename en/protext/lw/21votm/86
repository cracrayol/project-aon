	Your superb horsemanship keeps you from falling off. Š	It also helps you to regain control of your steed and 
	steer him swiftly towards the crest of the rockfall. Š	The first boulders are beginning to smash down around Š	you as valiently he carries you to the top of the Š	mound and gallops over the far side. You are half-Š	blinded by dust, but still you are able to dodge a Š	falling boulder which threatens to break your back Š	before you reach the safety of the open trail beyond.
	
	Here you rein in your horse and turn him about so Š	that you can take stock of the damage which has been Š	caused by this second rockfall.
