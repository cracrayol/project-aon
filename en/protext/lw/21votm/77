	Following the landlady's written directions, you make Š	your way through the streets of the city to a wide Š	concourse which ascends to a knoll called Zakhan's Š	Mount that overlooks the south gatehouse. Through the Š	open gates you can see the mighty bridge which spans Š	the lower fork of the River Khorda. Beyond lie the Š	Bavari hills shimmering in a heat haze, and towards Š	the horizon are the Great Masourn mountains which Š	appear like a jagged purple frieze appended to the Š	sky.

	Standing in line before the south gates is a caravan Š	of wagons drawn by sturdy douggas, the sand horses of Š	the Dry Main. Many wagons are piled high with Š	merchant's goods destined for Bavari - a rich cargo Š	watched over by a dozen armed outriders in the pay of Š	the caravan's owners. You approach a line of trestle Š	tables set up near the leading wagons where Š	passengers may purchase a seat aboard the caravan for Š	the 3-day journey to Bavari.	Chalked upon a slate is Š	the price of the fare: 7 Gold Crowns.
