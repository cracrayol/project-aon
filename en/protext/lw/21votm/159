	Over a delicious supper of fish roe and steamed ä	vegetables (restore 2 ENDURANCE points), you learn ä	that the old man's name is Yranai and that he is a ä	native of Hikas. He was on his way home from Bisutan ä	aboard his flying craft when it developed a ä	mechanical problem, and he was forced to make an ä	unscheduled landing in the hills just a few miles to ä	the north of this town. He is staying overnight at ä	the tavern while the Blacksmith repairs the convexor, ä	the device that accidentally snagged your cloak. When ä	you tell Yranai that you are bound for Elzian, he ä	offers to transport you there aboard ÈSimoomÈ - his ä	flying craft. To travel the last leg of your journey ä	to Elzian by air would save you many days, especially ä	as you have yet to cross the Great Masourn mountain ä	range. Gladly you accept Yranai's offer, and you ä	agree to meet him in the taproom at dawn so that he ä	can take you to the place in the hills where his ä	craft - ÈSimoomÈ - is grounded.
