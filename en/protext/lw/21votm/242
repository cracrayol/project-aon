	You are woken at first light by the cawing of ä	seagulls and the sound of the waves pounding the ä	shore. You strike camp after a breakfast of fresh ä	shrimp and crab, which Oswin caught in a tidal pool ä	during his pre-dawn watch, and then you bid farewell ä	to this beautiful little bay. 
	
	You while away the hours that you spend riding the ä	coast road by recounting some of the many legends of ä	the Kai. The marines are particularly enthralled by ä	your account of the quest for the Lorestones of ä	Nyxator, when Sun Eagle - the first Kai Lord - sought ä	out the legendary seven stones of power so that he ä	could acquire the secrets of the Magnakai ä	disciplines. At noon you stop to rest your horses and ä	catch some local game called Flomi. These rabbit-like ä	creatures are so plentiful in these parts that you ä	have enough food left over for 2 Meals (if you decide ä	to keep this food, amend your ÈAction ChartÈ ä	accordingly).

	The afternoon ride passes pleasantly without incident ä	nor delay, and shortly before sunset you come within ä	sight of the town gates of Khor. It is only now that ä	you see something in the distance which gives you ä	cause for concern.
