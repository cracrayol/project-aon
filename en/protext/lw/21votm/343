	After having stripped to your undergarments and Š	locked your tunic and equipment safely away in your Š	cabin, you join Oriah at the bow of the ship where Š	you get ready to enter the sea together. Fernant and Š	Raker watch from the forward deck as the two of you Š	leap into the warm waters of the cove and make your Š	first dive upon the wreck. Oriah is a strong swimmer, Š	and you can tell by the effortless way she descends Š	through the water that she is a skilled diver.
	
	The galleon is broken at its centre and lies with its Š	fore and aft sections seperated by an expanse of  Š	debris-strewn sand. As you view the halves of the Š	wreck, two areas of particular interest catch your Š	eye: a gaping hole in the hull of the forward Š	section, and a cabin located on the rear poop deck.


	If you wish to investigate the hole in the hull, turn Š	to  â117â

	If you wish to investigate the cabin on the rear Š	deck, turn to  â184â
