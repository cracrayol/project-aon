	You unsheathe a hand weapon and struggle across the ä	heaving deck to regain your position at the ship's ä	rail. The enemy vessel has rammed the ÈPride of ä	SommerlundÈ and now a host of screaming warriors are ä	swarming aboard your stricken ship. You glance aloft ä	and see the giant spider scurry through the rigging ä	towards the crow's nest. The Sommlending lookout ä	shrieks hysterically and, in blind panic, throws ä	himself into the sea to avoid being eaten by the ä	hideous monster. On the deck below you can see ä	Sergeant Dryan and his men are fighting bravely to ä	repel the raiders. Those of Raker's crew who have ä	survived the collision hurriedly arm themselves and ä	rush to support the outnumbered marines, but they are ä	not trained fighters and they are no match for this ä	ruthless enemy. 


	If you wish to descend to the deck below and fight ä	alongside Sergeant Dryan's marines, turn to  ‚21‚

	If you choose instead to climb the rigging and attack ä	the giant spider that is now perched upon the crow's ä	nest, turn to  ‚121‚
