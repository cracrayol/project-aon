	You lightning-fast blow strikes the spider and sends Š	it hurtling across the room. It hits the far wall and Š	clings there for few moments, then it scurries down Š	to disappear through a crack in the uneven bamboo Š	floor. Your close encounter with this potentially Š	deadly spider plays on your mind and you find it Š	impossible to go back to sleep (lose 2 ENDURANCE Š	points due to fatigue). 
	
	At first light you gather together your equipment and Š	go down to the paddock to collect your horse. The Š	hostel-keeper calls you from the kitchen window and Š	holds up a large plate of food that is your Š	breakfast. The memory of the Zuath crawling up your Š	leg invades your mind and the thought robs you of Š	your appetite. You wave the man farewell and then Š	mount your horse and ride away across the courtyard.
