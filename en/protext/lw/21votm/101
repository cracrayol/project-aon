	Quickly you unshoulder your bow and snatch an arrow Š	from your quiver. Bracing yourself against the ship's Š	rail, you draw back your bowstring and scan the decks Š	of the attacking ship for a suitable target. Two Š	immediately loom into view. The first is the ghastly Š	maw of the giant spider; the second is the head of a Š	warrior who is standing inside the forecastle. From Š	the way he is shouting at those around him, you Š	suspect that he must be the commander of the enemy Š	vessel.


	If you choose to fire your arrow at the spider-Š	creature, turn to  â322â

	If you choose to fire at the warrior's head, turn 
	to  â170â
