	You are shocked to see the attacking ship has a large ä	cannon mounted on its prow. Moments after the pirates ä	fire their gun, you hear the whistle of a heavy ä	cannonball as it hurtles towards the deck of the ä	ÈPride of SommerlundÈ. It rips through the gunwale a ä	few feet from where you are standing and, as you dive ä	to avoid it, you are hit in the legs by splinters of ä	wood (lose 1 ENDURANCE point).
	
	Fortunately, the rest of the crew escape injury and ä	damage to the ship is minimal. Sergeant Dryan ä	commands his men to return fire and a volley of shots ä	from the three swivel guns slam into the bow of the ä	pirate ship with devastating effect. Two shots ä	penetrate below the waterline and the third severs ä	the bowsprit. As it falls into the ocean, it rips ä	away sail and rigging which drag more than a dozen ä	pirates overboard. In disarray, the enemy vessel ä	veers from its collision course and founders in the ä	wake of the ÈPride of SommerlundÈ as it enters the ä	Bukimi Channel. Here your ship picks up a prevailing ä	wind which propels it away from the second pirate ä	raider. Soon both ships have disappeared and, when ä	Raker is sure that the danger has passed, he warmly ä	praises both the marines and his crew for the skill ä	and courage they have displayed. 

	Later, as the ship navigates the narrow strait ä	dividing the two Lakuri islands, you pass within a ä	few hundred yards of the fire-blackened ruins of a ä	beach settlement which nestles in a bay, overshadowed ä	on three sides by cliffs. This is Kita Cove, formerly ä	a secret base from where Captain Khadro launched his ä	pirate fleet. As you stare at the charred remnants of ä	the pirate settlement, you try to imagine what it ä	must have looked like before the encampment was ä	consumed by a tremendous fireball that sealed its ä	doom. Suddenly your daydreaming is interupted when, ä	to your shocked surprise, you see something moving ä	among the ruins.
