	Skilfully you ascend the rigging and approach the Š	giant spider from behind and below. It is busily Š	tearing at the mast and topsail with its fanged maw, Š	and at first it fails to notice you. When you pause Š	for a few moments to unsheathe your weapon, suddenly Š	the creature swivels its head and fixes you with a Š	pair of ghastly green eyes. Chittering excitedly, it Š	rubs its forelegs together and sparks appear, warning Š	you that it is preparing to launch a bolt of energy. Š	Quickly you cut free a trailing rope and swing away Š	from the rigging just in time to avoid being burnt to Š	a cinder when it launches its burst of crackling blue Š	fire. Your swift reflexes save you, but as the Š	momentum of your swing carries you back towards the Š	rigging, so you see that the creature is preparing a Š	new form of attack.
	
	It waits until you come to rest upon the criss-cross Š	of ropes and then it ejects a stream of sickly grey Š	fluid from a sac located below its gaping maw. This Š	fluid hardens as it passes through the air, and is Š	transformed into several long and sticky strands Š	which threaten to engulf you.
