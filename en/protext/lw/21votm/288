	You stare across the ocean at the banks of angry clouds ä	which are growing larger and darker with every passing ä	minute. You sense that within them are tremendous natural ä	forces that are building up at a dangerous rate. You feel ä	certain that the presence of the Moonstone is partially ä	responsible for this, although	these waters are notorious ä	for sudden and violent sea storms. 

	You warn Kol of the distant storm and the disastrous ä	effect that it could have if it were to break upon his ä	cargo-heavy ship. You urge him to turn back to Bir ä	Rabalou but he dismisses your request out of hand. He ä	says that the storm is many miles away, and even if it ä	were to move nearer he is confident that the ÈDesert JewelÈ ä	is still swift enough to outrun it. You believe that he ä	is wrong and you are angered by his complacency, but ä	there is nothing you can say that will make him, or his ä	crew, turn this ship about. He is the master of this ä	vessel and his loyal crew will only obey his command.

	If you possess Kai-alchemy and wish to use the ä	Brotherhood spell of ÈMind CharmÈ to make Kol turn back to ä	Bir Rabalou, turn to  ‚46‚

	If you do not possess this skill, of if you choose not to ä	use it, you must accept Kol's decision to continue with ä	the voyage to Bisutan. Turn to  ‚269‚
