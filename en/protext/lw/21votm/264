	You retrieve the Iron Skull from your pocket and Š	offer it to the elder. He refuses to touch it and he Š	indicates that you should toss it to the ground. You Š	comply and it thuds into the soft earth near his Š	feet. With one startlingly swift blow he strikes the Š	iron skull with his staff and instantly it is Š	transformed into a noisome grey gas that rapidly Š	dissipates in the warm, damp air.

	The natives on the palisade take up their bows and Š	train them on you. Quickly you protest your innocence Š	to the elder, saying that you had no idea the skull Š	was an evil artifact. For a few seconds he stares Š	unnervingly into your eyes, then he turns to his Š	kinsmen and says one word: "Truth!"
	
	The Vakeros lower their bows and the elder indicates Š	that you are now free to enter their village.
