	It is noon of the following day when eventually you Š	emerge from the Koneshi mountains and catch your Š	first exciting glimpse of the great city of Bisutan, Š	seated upon an island in the estuary of the River Š	Khorda. With an air of expectation you follow the Š	mountain road as it meanders down through sagebrush Š	hills until, at dusk, you finally reach a titanic Š	stone bridge that spans the shimmering waters of the Š	Khorda. This mighty bridge has for centuries carried Š	a flow of traders to and from a towering gatehouse
	which is set into the city's protective wall. 
	
	It is not the custom of Bisutanian's city guards to Š	stop travellers without good reason, for here the Š	merchants of all Magnamund meet to haggle and trade Š	and barter their cargoes. With a courteous smile they Š	allow you to pass through their great gate and enter Š	their magnificent city.
