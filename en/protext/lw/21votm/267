	Oriah and the marines wait for you outside the Š	stables as you approach the paddock alone. The horses Š	become skittish as you get closer, yet you are able Š	to subdue them by using your animal mastery.	Silently Š	you pull open the paddock gate and command the Š	nearest five horses to leave the enclosure. Š	Obediently they obey your commands, following meekly Š	as you lead them away in single file to your waiting Š	companions.

	You mount your borrowed steeds and Ernan leads the Š	way along a broad avenue that ends at the town's Š	southern gatehouse. Two sleepy-eyed guards watch with Š	indifference as you pass through the open gate and Š	depart from Cape Kabar along its dusty coast road.
