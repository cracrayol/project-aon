	You continue your ride along the jungle trail and Š	make good progress, although you are haunted all the Š	while by a profound sense of unease. You attribute Š	these feelings to the sight of Gorgoron. You have Š	heard many dark tales about this chasm which, until Š	now, you had dismissed as nothing more than fanciful Š	ghost stories. Having seen the chasm with your own Š	eyes you are no longer so ready to disbelieve them.

	At sundown you reach the palmy fringes of an ancient Š	settlement that surrendered to the jungle centuries Š	ago. The moon rises like a silver shield in the Š	cloudless night sky and you make camp at the side of Š	the trail, sheltered beneath a canopy of mosses and Š	vines. The jungle is alive with the tiny noises of Š	its nocturnal creatures. They seem to make your horse Š	unusually nervous, until you soothe him with your Š	magnakai skills of animal control. You are tired Š	after your long ride through this humid rain forest Š	and soon you drift off to sleep. It seems as if you Š	have only just closed your eyes when you are stirred Š	to instant wakefulness by the sound of a ghastly Š	howl.
