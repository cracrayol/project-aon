	Kol is susceptible to your psychic suggestions and he ä	obeys your mental order to turn the ship around. At ä	first his crew are shocked and puzzled when suddenly ä	he commands them to change course, but they do not ä	question his decision. Silently they obey their ä	master and within minutes the ÈDesert JewelÈ is sailing ä	back to Bir Rabalou.

	You return to the city's harbour at dusk where you ä	are met by a dozen of the Funtal's guardsmen who are ä	checking ships along the quayside. Kol recognises ä	their officer - he is a man called Jhioua and he is ä	an old friend of his. Eventually a gangplank is ä	lowered and Kol steps briskly ashore to engage his ä	friend in conversation. With the officer distracted, ä	you now use your Kai camouflage skills to evade the ä	wary eyes of his guardsmen and escape from the ship.
