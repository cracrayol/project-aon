	As you climb through the foothills and leave behind ä	the coastal plain, so the oppressive heat of the ä	desert sun gradually cools as you go higher. ä	Thankfully the hill road is in a good state of repair ä	and you are able to relax and enjoy the magnificent ä	scenery as you travel towards the Koneshi mountains. ä	It is early in the evening when you come to a stone ä	bridge which passes over a steep-sided gorge. On the ä	far side of the bridge you can see a toll booth and an ä	inn and a few stone hovels which comprise a tiny ä	mountain village. With daylight fast fading you decide ä	to cross the gorge and spend the night at the inn. You ä	are halfway across the bridge when a muscular young ä	man, dressed in a scarlet mhaktis and clutching a ä	ceremonial sword, emerges from the toll booth and ä	signals for you to halt. He tells you that if you wish ä	to cross the bridge and spend the night at the ä	mountain inn, the price will be 20 Gold Crowns.


	If you wish to pay this price, amend your ÈAction ChartÈ ä	accordingly and turn to  ‚37‚

	If you do not have sufficient Gold Crowns, or if you ä	simply refuse to pay this sum, turn instead to  ‚338‚
