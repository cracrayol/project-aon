	You look to the bell and use your Kai mastery in an Š	attempt to locate the creature, but you can sense Š	nothing unusual. Then a knot of fear tightens in your Š	throat when suddenly you detect a powerful aura of Š	evil. You turn to look at the cowering cleric and Š	your fear becomes an icy terror when you realise that Š	éheé is the source of the evil. Slowly you move Š	backwards towards the stairs and he pleads with you Š	not to go. Then he abandons his pretence. The pupils Š	of his eyes shimmer and become spheres that glow Š	darkly amber, and in a terrifying instant his body Š	transforms. One moment he is a bearded holy man and, Š	in a split-second blur, he becomes a snarling hulk of Š	black furred death. With breathtaking speed it leaps Š	at you and slashes at your throat with its razor-Š	sharp talons.
