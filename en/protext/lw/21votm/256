	You enter the right alley and the militia, who are Š	following closely, split into two groups. Roughly Š	half their number search the other alley whilst the Š	remainder stay with you. 
	
	As you are running along this narrow thoroughfare, Š	suddenly you hear the sound of splintering timbers Š	somewhere in the distance. A hundred yards later the Š	alley opens out into a tree-lined plaza which is Š	bordered by shops selling rare artifacts of the Old Š	Kingdom, and expensive works of art. Their windows Š	and doors are securely barred and shuttered and show Š	no signs of a forced entry.	Then your eye is drawn to Š	a grand building on the far side of the plaza: it is Š	a temple. Its great stone door is closed, but a Š	smaller wooden door at the side has been torn off its Š	hinges. You magnify your vision and see that beyond Š	the door are a flight of stone steps which ascend to Š	a belltower.
	
	Cautiously you approach the shattered door. You Š	unsheathe your weapon and scan the darkened stairs Š	before silently you ascend the steps. You have Š	climbed twenty steps when suddenly you hear a hideous Š	snickering growl and an icy chill runs the length of Š	your spine. There is an ominous creak of stone on Š	stone and a movement in the darkness above, then a Š	crashing fills your ears. Out of the darkness you see Š	a great marble statue come smashing down the narrow Š	stairway. It rapidly gathers speed as it tumbles end Š	over end towards you.
