	As you turn to leave the lodging house, you are ä	approached by a rakish young man. He has been ä	listening to your brief conversation with the owner ä	and he says he is concerned for your welfare. He ä	warns you that the city is a dangerous place at night ä	and he offers to buy any items that you may want to ä	sell in order to raise some money. 
	
	This man will pay you 10 Gold Crowns for any Special ä	Item (excluding the Moonstone which is not for sale), ä	3 Gold Crowns for any Weapon, and 1 Gold Crown for ä	any Backpack Item. If you wish to raise money by ä	selling any items of equipment to this man, adjust ä	your ÈAction ChartÈ accordingly.


	If you now possess 3 Gold Crowns or more, turn 
	to  ‚291‚

	If you now possess 2 Gold Crowns or less, turn 
	to  ‚214‚
