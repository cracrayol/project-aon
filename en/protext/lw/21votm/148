	You make a hurried departure from Khor and pitch camp Š	for the night on a beach three miles south of the Š	town. Before you settle down to sleep, you and your Š	companions try to determine how far away you are from Š	Bisutan. With the aid of your map and your knowledge Š	of the stars, confidently you proclaim that the city Š	is only two days ride away.		

	The next day you set off before dawn and you make Š	good progress on the coast road. At sunset you set up Š	camp in a grove of lemon trees, where you enjoy the Š	fruits of this orchard with your evening meal of Š	freshly caught sea bass. You sleep well this night, Š	but early the following morning you wake up to an Š	unwelcome surprise.
