	Hurriedly you descend from the rear deck and rush ä	forward to where Sergeant Dryan is directing his men.
	The leading pirate ship has now closed to within ä	fifty yards and you can see the grim faces of its ä	murderous crew. Dryan's marines are busily loading ä	the three swivel cannon which are fixed to the port ä	gunwale. Once loaded, each marine gunner raises his ä	hand to signal that his piece is primed to fire. ä	Dryan is waiting for the third gunner to signal and ä	he is ready to give the order to fire, when suddenly ä	there is a thunderous roar and a puff of grey smoke ä	erupts unexpectedly from the prow of the attacking ä	ship.
