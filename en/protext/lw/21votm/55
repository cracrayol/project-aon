	Your Kai sixth sense informs you that the whirlpool ä	is being created by a powerful entity, a creature who ä	is hiding somewhere amongst the undergrowth which ä	blankets the overhanging cliff. From its high vantage ä	point it is pouring its evil energy down into the ä	channel below, causing the vortex which now threatens ä	to drag the ÈPride of SommerlundÈ to a deep, watery ä	grave.

	You inform Raker of what you have detected and he ä	orders the marines to fire a volley from their deck ä	guns, aimed at the foliage on top of the cliff.

	Pick a number from the ÈRandom Number TableÈ.


	If the number you have chosen is ‚0‚ or ‚1‚, turn to  ‚16‚

	If it is  ‚2‚ - ‚9‚, turn to  ‚294‚
