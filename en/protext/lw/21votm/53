	You watch aghast as the itikars swoop past the Š	balloon and rake their talons across its canopy. 
	The sudden loss of gas from the canopy shakes the Š	basket and you are knocked off your feet. Yranai Š	falls on top of you and, for a few nerve-racking Š	seconds, you lie entangled at the bottom of the Š	basket as the balloon rapidly loses altitude. When Š	you pull yourself up and peer over the rim, you see Š	the trees of the lower mountain slopes rising towards Š	you at a dizzying speed. Yranai looks up to see Š	shreds of cloth trailing from the punctured canopy Š	above and the sight proves too much for him: he Š	faints. Hurriedly you haul his frail body over your Š	shoulder. Then you place one foot on the rim of the Š	basket and get ready to make a desperate leap away Š	from this doomed balloon as the tops of the 
	mountain pines rise into view.
