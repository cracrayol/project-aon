	The slaver sees you running towards him and the sight Š	immediately wipes the sneer from his face. With a Š	squeal of fright he grabs hold of a young female Š	slave and cowers behind her, using her body as a Š	shield to protect himself from you. Repeatedly he Š	screams the name "Svolta!" until, in answer to his Š	frantic cry, a short man in a close-fitting grey robe Š	suddenly appears from behind the row of slaves. He is Š	carrying a Vassagonian cavalry bow with an arrow Š	already fixed to the bowstring. The slaver commands Š	him to fire at you and the man obeys with Š	breathtaking speed.
