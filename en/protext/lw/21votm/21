	You give voice to your battle-cry: "For Sommerlund Š	and the Kai!" as fearlessly you leap from the rear Š	deck into the midst of the enemy horde. You slay Š	three of the armoured warriors with the first sweep Š	of your weapon, and cleave the sword arm from the Š	body of another with your backstroke. Noise, death, Š	and confusion press in on all sides, yet you remain Š	ice-cool in the heat of this fierce deck battle. A Š	turbanned warrior with mad, glinting eyes hurls Š	himself at you. He whirls his axe above his head to Š	split your skull, but before he can land his blow, Š	you leap into the air and send him cartwheeling Š	backwards with a mighty kick to his chest. The moment Š	your feet return to the blood-slick deck, you
	spring forward once more like a charging lion and Š	whirl your weapon like a scythe before you. Its blade Š	becomes a deadly blur as you cut a devastating path Š	through the raiders' serried ranks. You have fought Š	your way to within a dozen paces of Sergeant Dryan Š	when suddenly the enemy launch a desperate counter-Š	attack in an effort to halt your inexorable advance.
