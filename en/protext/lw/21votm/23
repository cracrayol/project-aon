	The leader of the troubadours says nothing, yet the Š	crestfallen look on his face is enough to tell you Š	that you have answered his riddle correctly. Your Š	fellow passengers cheer and applaud your display of Š	mental dexterity as you walk to the barrel to collect Š	your prize of 10 Gold Crowns (éif you already possess Š	the maximum number of Gold Crowns permissible, Š	generously you share the coins out among those Š	passengers who are travelling in your carriageé).

	The show continues, but you are feeling tired and so Š	you return to the empty passenger wagon. Before you Š	pull your cloak around yourself and settle down to Š	sleep, you must now eat a Meal or lose 3 ENDURANCE Š	points (unless you possess the discipline of Grand Š	Huntmastery).
