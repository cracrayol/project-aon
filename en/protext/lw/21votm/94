	The creature leaps upon you as you are falling Š	backwards and you tumble down the circular stairs, Š	locked together in a deadly embrace. It hits the Š	floor of the landing below and its body cushions your Š	impact, enabling you to recover quickly and unsheathe Š	your weapon. The creature is momentarily stunned by Š	the fall and you seize the opportunity to attack it Š	before it can get to its feet.
