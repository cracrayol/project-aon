	Quickly you utter the words of the Brotherhood spell ä	- ÈLevitationÈ - and you rise into the air. Moments ä	later, the statue crashes down and shears the surface ä	from the steps on which, just seconds ago, you were ä	standing. You see the statue finally reach the bottom ä	of the stairwell where it smashes into several large ä	segments which block the narrow doorway and fill the ä	base of the stairwell with thick dust. You speak the ä	words which counter the effects of spell and feel ä	yourself gliding down towards the cracked steps. The ä	moment your feet touch down, you race up the stairs ä	in pursuit of the scourge of Hikas.
