	The men standing at the counter move away at your Š	approach, and one of them, a bilious rogue with Š	close-set eyes and a cleft chin, casts you a Š	murderous glance. You ignore him and ask the Š	innkeeper for a room and stabling for the night. He Š	says the tavern is full and he suggests that you look Š	elsewhere. Chalked on a board above the counter is Š	the message: Rooms - 2 Gold Crowns nightly, and Š	hanging on a line of brass hooks behind the Š	innkeeper's back are seven room keys. The man is Š	lying: every boarding room in this tavern is Š	unoccupied.


	If you wish to ask the innkeeper why he is lying, Š	turn to  â131â

	If you decide to place 2 Gold Crowns on the counter, Š	turn to  â191â
