	The creature leaps upon you as you are falling Š	backwards and together you tumble down the circular Š	stairs, locked in a deadly embrace. You hit the floor Š	of the landing below with a numbing jolt which leaves Š	you momentarily stunned (lose 2 ENDURANCE points), Š	but still you manage to roll aside to evade the Š	creature's slashing claws which rake deep grooves in Š	the stone floor. With a corkscrew twist of your body, Š	you are able to free yourself and spring to your Š	feet. This creates the vital space you need in order Š	to unsheathe your weapon and use it against this Š	determined and terrible foe.
