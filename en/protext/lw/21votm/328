	You wake before dawn and spend an hour cleaning your ä	weapons and equipment before going downstairs to the ä	taproom of the tavern. Behind the counter the tavern-ä	keeper's wife is busy preparing breakfast for herself ä	and her family, and she bids you a hurried good ä	morning. Mindful of your need for transport, you ask ä	if there are any horses for sale at the adjoining ä	stables.
	
	"Only one," she replies, wiping her hands on her ale-ä	stained apron. "An old mare called Jheni. She's past ä	her prime but she's strong and dependable. I can let ä	you have her for 10 Gold Crowns, and I'll throw in a ä	saddle. What do you say to that ?"
	
	You agree to her price and pay her (erase 10 Gold ä	Crowns from your ÈAction ChartÈ) and she calls for her ä	husband to bring the horse around to the front door. ä	The chestnut mare is old but she is in fine condition ä	and you are satisfied that you have made a wise ä	purchase. You mount up and bid the taverners farewell ä	before riding out of Bavari by way of its east gate. ä	Your new mount lives up to the woman's description of ä	her and you cover the first ten miles of your journey ä	along the coast road with ease. As you pass through a ä	grove of toa trees, you see a track branching off the ä	main road. It descends a slope to a cluster of huts ä	that are perched on the edge of a cliff overlooking ä	the sea.
