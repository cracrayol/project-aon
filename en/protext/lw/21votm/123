	Swiftly you recite the words of the Old Kingdom spell ä	- ÈInvisible ShieldÈ - and a transparent disc of ä	magical protection shimmers in front of your eyes. 
       An instant later the archer's arrow strikes this ä	sorcerous shield and disintegrates. As the splintered ä	wood of the missile falls to the ground, you see your ä	own arrow strike your would-be killer in the chest ä	and knock him down.  
	
	For a few uncertain moments the marines believe that ä	you have been mortally wounded, but they are quick to ä	cheer when they see you get to your feet and come ä	running towards them. Ernan helps you to retrieve ä	your horse and quickly you remount him and gallop ä	along the avenue which leads out of this unfriendly ä	town.
