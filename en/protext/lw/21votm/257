	Swiftly you recite the words of the Brotherhood spell ä	- ÈInvisible ShieldÈ - and immediately a transparent ä	disc of magical protection forms in front of your ä	eyes. Moments later, Svolta's arrow strikes this ä	sorcerous shield and shatters to pieces. The slaver ä	and his archer cannot believe what they have seen and ä	for a few vital seconds they stand frozen in stunned ä	disbelief. You seize this advantage and rush towards ä	the platform with the hope of catching them before ä	they regain their senses, yet as you make your leap
	you see the archer drop his bow and reach to his ä	sword. His blade clears its scabbard barely a second ä	before you make your attack, yet he is able to turn ä	aside your first blow. The skill with which he ä	handles his blade leaves you in no doubt that you are ä	facing an expert swordsman. Frightened slaves throw ä	themselves off the platform as you and Svolta begin a ä	desperate fight to the death.
