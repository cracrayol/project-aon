	You wake shortly after daybreak to the appetising Š	smell of boiled eggs and cured meat. This shortly Š	turns out to be your breakfast which the landlady Š	delivers personally to your room on a tray. Before Š	she goes, you take the opportunity to ask her if she Š	knows of any means of transport departing for Elzian Š	today. She says that there is no regular transport to Š	the Dessi capital, but she says that there is a Š	merchant's caravan leaving today for Hikas.

	"It takes paying passengers," she says, "but you'd Š	better hurry if you want to catch it. It leaves from Š	Zakhan's Mount in less than an hour."

	Quickly you finish your food and get ready to leave. Š	Before you go, the landlady gives you directions to Š	the Zakhan's Mount written on a scrap of parchment."
