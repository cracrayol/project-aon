	The landlady's frowning face softens as she slips the Š	money into the pocket of her apron. From this same Š	pocket she removes a key which is stamped with the Š	number '4', and she hands it to you. Then she points Š	to a corridor on the ground floor which leads to your Š	room at the rear of the building. 
	
	As you are about to insert the key into the lock, you Š	hear a suspicious noise coming from somewhere inside. Š	Silently you unsheathe your weapon, unlock the door, Š	and then fling it wide open.
