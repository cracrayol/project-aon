	The marines load and fire three vollies at the Š	clifftop. You watch the target area and your sixth Š	sense tells you that their shots, although they do Š	not hit the creature directly, pass close to scare Š	it. With relief, you sense the unseen creature is
	retreating in the face of this barrage and, as it Š	abandons its sorcerous attack, so the whirlpool ahead Š	ceases to spin violently.

	As the waters of the channel return to normal, Raker
	commends the marines for their gunnery skills. Then Š	he commands his crew to unfurl every remaining square Š	inch of canvas. The sails catch the prevailing winds Š	and carry the ship swiftly through the narrow channel Š	and away from the menacing shadow of the cliffs.
