	The timid little trader sees that you are about to Š	walk away without buying anything, after having spent Š	some time examining his wares. Immediately he Š	suspects that you think him too expensive and so he Š	decides to lower his prices. He now offers to let you Š	have any of his potions for only 2 Gold Crowns each.


	If you now wish to buy one of more of his potions, Š	return to â7â and make your choice from the potions Š	listed there. 

	If you still have no desire to buy any of his Š	potions, turn to  â96â
