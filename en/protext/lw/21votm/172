	At the entrance to the village stands a ramshackle 
	inn constructed from sandstone, driftwood, and Š	canvas. A creaking sign above its door says: 'The Š	Serene Funtal'. Sligh laughs when he reads this - 
	"Ha, I'd wager this wern't named after that mangy cur Š	who rules Bir Rabalou now, that's for sure."
	
	A lean-to built from old ship's timbers provides Š	shelter for the horses. Two fresh-faced young boys 
	take charge and you can tell by the skilful way they Š	handle them that your steeds are in good hands. The Š	inn itself, despite its dilapidation, has a warm and Š	friendly feel. The owner seems genuinely pleased to Š	see you and he is helpful almost to a fault. Food and Š	lodging for the night is 12 Gold Crowns. The marines Š	are able to scrape together six crowns, leaving it to Š	you to come up with the remaining six.


	If you possess 6 Gold Crowns and wish to pay the Š	balance of the bill, turn to  â95â

	If you do not possess sufficient Gold Crowns, or if Š	you do not wish to pay the balance, turn to  â58â
