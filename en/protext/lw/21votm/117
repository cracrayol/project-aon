	You follow a shoal of yellow-tailed fish into the ä	gaping hole in the hull and discover scores of boxes, ä	bales and casks lying scattered within. Most of the ä	cargo sealed inside these containers is no longer of ä	use nor value, yet inside one rotten casket you ä	discover an item that gleams like new. It is a golden ä	crown, embellished with rural scenes of a distant ä	land that you recognize to be Siyen. (If you wish to ä	keep this Siyen Crown, record it on your ÈAction ChartÈ ä	as a Special Item which you carry in your backpack.)

	Through the hole in the wrecked hull you glimpse ä	Oriah ascending to the surface for air. Satisfied ä	that there is little else of value aboard this wreck, ä	you leave the hold and return to the bow of the ÈPride ä	of Sommerlund.È
