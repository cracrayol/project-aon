	The marines fire three vollies at the clifftop but Š	their shots neither frighten nor deter the creature. Š	In fact they serve to antagonise this hidden entity Š	and immediately it increases the intensity of its Š	evil spell.
	
	Panic grips the crew and many leap abandon their Š	posts and leap overboard. In desperation, you seize Š	the helm and draw upon your Kai mastery in an attempt Š	to avert a total catastrophe, but it is too late. Š	Despite your best efforts, the ship is caught in the Š	grip of the whirlpool. With chilling speed it is Š	sucked down to its final resting place upon the rocky Š	bed of the Bukimi Channel, a thousand fathoms below Š	the swirling surface. 
	
	Sadly, your life and your quest end here.
