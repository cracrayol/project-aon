	You fight to stay on his back but you lose grip of Š	the rope reins and he throws you off. The moment you Š	hit the dirt, he bolts forward and gallops over the Š	crest of the rockfall. Shaken but otherwise unharmed, Š	you scramble to your feet and chase after him. The Š	first boulders are beginning to smash down around you Š	as you scurry to the top of the mound and leap feet-Š	first over the far side. Half-blinded by dust, you Š	slide and roll until you feel something heavy hit the Š	back of your head and then you are plunged into a Š	dark oblivion.

	When you regain consciousness, your head is aching Š	viciously (lose 5 ENDURANCE points) and your legs are Š	buried beneath a mound of dust and loose shale. You Š	are bruised all over your body but fortunately you Š	have sustained no broken bones. Slowly and painfully Š	you dig yourself free with your bare hands. When you Š	are able to pull yourself to your feet, to your Š	surprise you see your horse is standing, unharmed, Š	less than twenty yards away along the mountain trail. Š	You hobble towards him and ease yourself onto his Š	back.
