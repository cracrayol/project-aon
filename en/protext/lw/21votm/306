	Using your innate Magnakai skills, you magnify your Š	vision and scan the island. The shoreline appears Š	deserted, but when you cast your eyes towards the Š	east you notice two tiny specks on the horizon. You Š	alert Captain Raker to the threat but he dismisses Š	your warning, saying it is merely heat haze.
	
	Several minutes later the ship's lookout confirms Š	that there are two ships on the eastern horizon. Š	Raker brings his telescope to bear and after a few Š	moments observation he says: "You were right, my Š	lord. I should have known better than to doubt the Š	eyes of a Kai." Lowering his telescope, he turns and Š	shouts an order to Paoll:

	"South-by-south west, if you please First Mate. Looks Š	like we've got comp'ny!"
	
	The timbers creak as the ship turns about and forges Š	a new passage through deep water. Following the Š	change of bearing the wind is now no longer in your Š	favour and Paoll is forced to tack against it to make Š	headway. The lighter ships have the advantage and Š	they quickly draw closer. Soon you can see that they Š	are Vassagonian men o'war, although they fly no flags Š	of allegiance or origin. Judging by their poor Š	general condition it is clear that they are pirate Š	raiders. Raker orders his men to their battle Š	positions and Sergeant Dryan issues an order to his Š	marines to stand ready at the cannons as the pirate Š	raiders bear down upon the port bow.
