	"That's wrong, that's wrong!" shouts the rogue, his Š	eyes widening with fear. 
	
	"He does not know the name of his own capital!" gasps  Š	one of his companions, and his mouth drops open as he Š	fumbles to unsheathe his sword. Suddenly it seems Š	that everyone in the tavern is gripped by an Š	inexplicable madness. The rogue pulls a dagger from Š	his belt and attempts to stab you, but you turn his Š	clumsy thrust aside with your forearm and knock him Š	to the floor as you leap out of your seat. Two of the Š	others try to strike you simultaneously with their Š	swords and you duck below their blades. They strike Š	each other and fall back, screaming and clutching at Š	their wounds. A thrown bottle catches you a glancing Š	blow to the head as you run for the door (lose 2 Š	ENDURANCE points), but you manage to pull it open and Š	escape into the darkening street without further Š	injury. However, to your dismay you discover that Š	your horse Jhani has disappeared. Two men brandishing Š	swords appear in the doorway behind you and swiftly Š	you sprint along the street. You use your Kai Š	camouflage skills to evade them and they quickly give Š	up the chase.
