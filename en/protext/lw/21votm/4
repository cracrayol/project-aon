	With the help of your Kai skills and the failing ä	light, you slip away from the ÈDesert JewelÈ and return ä	to the Tradewind Tavern. Here you are fortunate to ä	discover the three marines who, despite their best ä	efforts this day, have been unable to sell your horse ä	and raise enough money to leave. They are surprised ä	to see you come walking through the door, but very ä	glad that you have returned. Oswin tells you that a ä	curfew has been declared and that all foreigners have ä	been forbidden to use the streets after dark. The ä	tavernkeeper, who openly hates the Funtal, offers to ä	hide you in the stables tonight in case the city ä	guard should pay another visit. Gratefully you accept ä	his offer and spend the night hiding in his hay loft.
