	The marines go to their rooms and you are about to ä	retire to yours when the innkeeper notices that you ä	have a musical instrument, part of which is ä	protruding from beneath the flap of your backpack. He ä	asks if you would be kind enough to play for his ä	customers, but after having paid his son so much for ä	such poor food and lodging at this inn you do not ä	feel inclined to agree to his request. When you ä	refuse he offers you 5 Gold Crowns to change your ä	mind. 

	"Very well," you say, pocketing the five gold coins, ä	"I'll play them five songs, but no more."

	The villagers listen rapturously to your recital of ä	five popular Sommlending ballads. When you finish ä	they show their appreciation by giving you and ä	additional 2 Gold Crowns. (Unless you already possess ä	the maximum permissible, you may add a total of 7 ä	Gold Crowns to your ÈAction ChartÈ).
