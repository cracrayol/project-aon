	Begrudgingly you hand over twenty crowns to the young Š	man before you and your companions stable your horses Š	and enter the inn. To your disappointment you Š	discover that it is a dreary place with few Š	furnishings and decorations to soften its grey, Š	spartan interior. A dozen villagers sit huddled Š	around a pair of circular tables. With an air of Š	boredom they sip their watery ale and stare at the Š	walls in dull-eyed silence. The innkeeper, who is the Š	father of the toll collector, serves you each a plate Š	of stale bread and cheese for your supper. He tries Š	to engage the marines in conversation, but they are Š	so disgruntled with the poor food that they Š	deliberately ignore him. Oswin suggests that you all Š	get some sleep and make an early start, and the Š	others heartily agree.

	If you do not possess this skill, or if you do not Š	have a musical instrument, turn to â8â
