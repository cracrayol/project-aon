	At the end of the street you discover a tavern which ä	adjoins the town's east gatehouse. It has a stables ä	and a small blacksmithy, and the first floor has been ä	given over to a rooming hostel. It is a popular place ä	and you see several people entering and leaving by ä	its main door.

	Beyond this door you discover a warm taproom with ä	great padded chairs and tables of yellow Siyenese ä	elm. You approach the tavern-keeper's wife who is ä	serving ale to customers in tankards made of hardened ä	leather. You enquire if she has a room for the night
	and she nods and smiles. "Three Gold Crowns," she ä	says, "and for that you can have as much ale as you ä	can stomach!" 

	You pay her 3 Gold Crowns (erase these from your ä	ÈAction ChartÈ) but you decline a tankard of her ale. ä	It has a peculiar smell that makes you think of ä	greasy animal hides.
