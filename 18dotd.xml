     <p>You are Grand Master Lone Wolf of Sommerlund, sole survivor of a  massacre that wiped out the First Order of the Kai<ch.emdash/>an <ch.eacute/>lite warrior caste.</p>

     <p>It is the year MS 5077, twenty-seven years since your brave kinsmen perished at the hands of the Darklords of Helgedad. These champions of evil, who were sent forth by Naar, the King of the Darkness, to destroy the fertile world of Magnamund, have themselves since been destroyed. You vowed to avenge the murder of the Kai and you kept your pledge, for it was you who brought about their downfall when alone you infiltrated their foul domain<ch.emdash/>the Darklands<ch.emdash/>and caused the destruction of their leader and the base of his power that was the infernal city of Helgedad.</p>

     <p>In the wake of their destruction, chaos befell the Darkland armies who, until then, had been poised to conquer all of Magnamund. Some factions which comprised this huge army, most notably the barbaric Drakkarim, began to fight with the others for control. This disorder quickly escalated into an all-out civil war which allowed the Freeland armies of Magnamund time in which to recover and launch a counter-offensive. Skilfully their commanders exploited the chaos and secured a swift and total victory over an enemy far superior in numbers.</p>

     <p>For seven years now peace has reigned in Sommerlund. Under your direction the once-ruined Monastery of the Kai has been thoroughly rebuilt and restored to its former glory, and the task of teaching a New Order of Kai warriors the skills and proud traditions of your ancestors is also well established. The new generation of Kai recruits, all of whom were born during the era of war against the Darklords, possess latent Kai skills and show exceptional promise. These skills will be nurtured and honed to perfection during their time here at the monastery so that they may teach and inspire future generations, thereby ensuring the continued security of your homeland in future years.</p>

     <p>Your attainment of the rank of Kai Grand Master brought with it great rewards. Some, such as the restoration of the Kai and the undying gratitude of your fellow Sommlending, could have been anticipated. Yet there have been rewards which you could not possibly have foreseen. The discovery that within you lay the potential to develop Kai Disciplines beyond those of the Magnakai, which, until now, were thought to be the ultimate that a Kai Master could aspire to, was truly a revelation. Your discovery has inspired you to set out upon a new and previously unknown path in search of the wisdom and power that no Kai Lord before you has ever possessed. In the name of your creator, the God Kai, and for the greater glory of Sommerlund and the Goddess Ishir, you have vowed to reach the very pinnacle of Kai perfection<ch.emdash/>to attain all of the Grand Master Disciplines and become the first Kai Supreme Master.</p>

     <p>With diligence and determination you set about the restoration of the Kai Monastery and the training of the New Order recruits. Your efforts were soon rewarded for, within the space of two short years, the first raw recruits had graduated to become a cadre of gifted Kai Masters who, in turn, were able to commence the teaching of their skills to subsequent intakes of Kai novices. Readily the Kai Masters rose to their newfound responsibilities, leaving you free to devote more of your time to the pursuit and perfection of the Grand Master Disciplines. During this period you also received expert tutelage in the ways of magic from two of your most trusted friends and advisors: Guildmaster Banedon, leader of the Brotherhood of the Crystal Star, and Lord Rimoah, speaker for the High Council of the Elder Magi.</p>

     <p>In the deepest subterranean level of the monastery, one hundred feet below the Tower of the Sun, you ordered the excavation and construction of a special vault. In this magnificent chamber wrought of granite and gold you placed the seven Lorestones of Nyxator, the gems of Kai power which you had recovered during an earlier quest for Kai knowledge. In this vault, bathed in the golden light of those radiant gems, you spent countless hours in pursuit of perfection. Sometimes alone, sometimes in the company of your two able advisors<ch.emdash/>Banedon and Rimoah<ch.emdash/>you worked hard to develop your innate Grand Master Disciplines, and grasp the fundamental secrets of Brotherhood and Old Kingdom magic. During this time you noticed many remarkable changes taking place within your body: you became physically and mentally stronger, your five primary senses sharpened beyond all that you had experienced before, and, perhaps most remarkably, your body began to age at a much slower rate. Now, for every five years that elapse you age but one year.</p>

     <p>In the years following your victory over the Darklords, peace has reigned victorious and the peoples of the Free Kingdoms rejoice in the knowledge that the evil which once threatened to destroy them has been banished from the face of Magnamund. Readily men have exchanged their swords for hoes and their shields for ploughs, and now the only marching they do is along the ruts of their fleshly furrowed fields. Few are the watchful eyes that scan the distant horizon in fear of what may appear, although there are still those who maintain their vigilance, for the agents of the Dark God Naar come in many guises and there are those upon Magnamund who wait quietly in the shadows for the chance to do his evil bidding.</p>

     <p>Already your newfound skills have been tested against Naar<ch.apos/>s agents and you have, on each occasion, acquitted yourself admirably. But your continuing victories against his minions have enraged the Dark God and inflamed his lust for vengeance. One such minion, the powerful Deathlord of Ixia, threatened to enslave the free nations of Magnamund with a weapon forged by Naar himself. Bravely you ventured alone into the Deathlord<ch.apos/>s icy domain and confronted him in a life-or-death battle in which you were triumphant. However, as you were returning from the Deathlord<ch.apos/>s frigid realm you learned that Sommerlund had been attacked. In your absence, Naar had sent forth a host of dragon-creatures to destroy the New Order of the Kai and lay waste to your homeland.</p>

     <p>The news came as a terrible shock. In Ixia you had won a great victory over Evil, yet at what cost? You had no doubts that the New Order were worthy Kai warriors, but they were all so young, their mettle as yet untested in the furnace-heat of battle. Secretly you feared that they would be unable to resist Naar<ch.apos/>s newest champions, and so you resolved to return as quickly as possible to Sommerlund to take command of the Kai Monastery and orchestrate your country<ch.apos/>s defences.</p>

     <p>In the court of King Sarnac of Lencia, in the city of Vadera, you received a pledge from the King himself that he would do all in his power to help speed your long journey home to Sommerlund. Accompanied by Lord Ardan, a friend and magician from the land of Dessi, you were put aboard a Lencian clipper, one of the fastest of all sea-going vessels. This ship was bound for Garthen<ch.emdash/>the principal city of Talestria<ch.emdash/>which lies more than a thousand miles to the east of Vadera. This was to be the first stage of your journey back to Sommerlund, a destination more than two thousand miles from Lencia. As you set sail from Vadera harbour you knew that you were embarking upon a race against time, a desperate race in which the future of your country and the New Order of the Kai were at stake.</p>

      <p>The Discipline bonuses mentioned do not affect your permanent scores. If you have completed previous adventures, the Disciplines that you have mastered may still be beneficial. See the Grand Master Rules section of the <a href="&link.rh;">Readers<ch.apos/> Handbook</a> for details.</p>

    <data>
     <p>You keep a record of your adventure on the <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
     <p>For more than six years, ever since the demise of the Darklords of Helgedad, you have devoted yourself to developing further your fighting prowess<ch.emdash/><typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ><ch.emdash/>and physical stamina<ch.emdash/><typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ>. Before you begin your first Grand Master adventure you need to measure how effective your training has been. To do this take a pencil and, with your eyes closed, point with the blunt end of it <!--ERRTAG-RE-13113-->onto<!--/ERRTAG-RE-13113--> the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a>. If you pick a 0 it counts as zero.</p>
     <p>The first number that you pick from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> in this way represents your <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ>. Add 25 to the number you picked and write the total in the <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> section of your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a> (i.e., if your pencil fell on the number 6 in the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> you would write in a <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> of 31). When you fight, your <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> will be pitted against that of your enemy. A high score in this section is therefore very desirable.</p>
     <p>The second number that you pick from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> represents your powers of <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ>. Add 30 to this number and write the total in the <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> section of your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a> (i.e., if your pencil fell on the number 7 on the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> you would have 37 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points).</p>
     <p>If you are wounded in combat you will lose <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points. If at any time your <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points fall to zero or below, you are dead and the adventure is over. Lost <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points can be regained during the course of the adventure, but your number of <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points can never rise above the number you have when you start an adventure.</p>
     <p>If you have successfully completed any of the previous adventures in the <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> series (Books 1<ch.endash/>17), you can carry your current scores of <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> and <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points over to Book 18. These scores may include Weaponmastery, Curing, and Psi-surge bonuses obtained upon completion of <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> Kai (Books 1<ch.endash/>5) or Magnakai (Books 6<ch.endash/>12) adventures.<footref id="gamerulz-1" idref="gamerulz-1-foot"/> Only if you have completed these previous adventures will you benefit from the appropriate bonuses in the course of the Grand Master series. You may also carry over any Weapons and Backpack Items you had in your possession at the end of your last adventure, and these should be entered on your new Grand Master <a idref="action">Action Chart</a> (you are still limited to two Weapons, but you may now carry up to ten Backpack Items).</p>
     <p>However, only the following Special Items may be carried over from the <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> Kai (Books 1<ch.endash/>5) and Magnakai (Books 6<ch.endash/>12) series to the <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> Grand Master series (Books 13<ch.endash/>onwards):</p>

       <p>Now, through the pursuit of your new skills and the further development of your innate Kai abilities, you have set out upon a path of discovery that no other Kai Grand Master has ever attempted with success. Your determination to become the first Kai Supreme Master, by acquiring total proficiency in all twelve of the Grand Master Disciplines, is an awe-inspiring challenge. You will be venturing into the unknown, pushing back the boundaries of human limitation in the pursuit of greatness and the cause of Good. May the blessings of the <!--ERRTAG-RE-27110-->Gods Kai and Ishir<!--/ERRTAG-RE-27110--> go with you as you begin your brave and noble quest.</p>
       <p>In the years following the demise of the Darklords you have reached the rank of Kai Grand Defender, which means that you have mastered <em>four</em> of the Grand Master Disciplines listed below. It is up to you to choose which four Disciplines these are. As all of the Grand Master Disciplines will be of use to you at some point during your adventure, pick your four skills with care. The correct use of a Grand Master Discipline at the right time could save your life.</p>

            <p>In order to use a Bow you must possess a Quiver and at least one Arrow. Each time the Bow is used, erase an Arrow from your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>.

       <p>There will be occasions during your adventure when you have to fight an enemy. The enemy<ch.apos/>s <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> and <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points are given in the text. Lone Wolf<ch.apos/>s aim in the combat is to kill the enemy by reducing his <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points to zero while losing as few <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points as possible himself.</p>
       <p>At the start of a combat, enter Lone Wolf<ch.apos/>s and the enemy<ch.apos/>s <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points in the appropriate boxes on the Combat Record section of your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>. The sequence for combat is as follows:</p>
       <ol class="paragraphed">
        <li><p>Add any extra points gained through your Grand Master Disciplines and Special Items to your current <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> total.</p></li>
        <li>
         <p>Subtract the <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> of your enemy from this total. The result is your Combat Ratio. Enter it on the <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
         <p>Example</p>
         <p>Lone Wolf (<typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> 27) is attacked by a pack of Doomwolves (<typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> 30). He is taken by surprise and is not given the opportunity of evading their attack. Lone Wolf has the Grand Master Discipline of Kai-surge to which the Doomwolves are not immune, so Lone Wolf adds 8 points to his <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ>, giving him a total <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> of 35.</p>
         <p>He subtracts the Doomwolf pack<ch.apos/>s <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> from his own, giving a Combat Ratio of +5. (35<ch.minus/>30 = +5). +5 is noted on the <a idref="action">Action Chart</a> as the Combat Ratio.</p>
        </li>
        <li><p><a id="stage3">When you have your Combat Ratio</a>, pick a number from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a>.</p></li>
        <li>
         <p>Turn to the <a idref="crtable">Combat Results Table</a>. Along the top of the chart are shown the Combat Ratio numbers. Find the number that is the same as your Combat Ratio and cross-reference it with the random number that you have picked (the random numbers appear on the side of the chart). You now have the number of <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points lost by both Lone Wolf and his enemy in this round of combat. (E represents points lost by the enemy; LW represents points lost by Lone Wolf.)</p>
         <p>Example</p>
         <p>The Combat Ratio between Lone Wolf and the Doomwolf Pack has been established as +5. If the number picked from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> is a 2, then the result of the first round of combat is:</p>
         <ul>
          <li>Lone Wolf loses 3 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points (plus an additional 1 point for using Kai-surge).</li>
          <li>Doomwolf Pack loses 7 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points.</li>
         </ul>
        </li>
        <li><p>On the <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>, mark the changes in <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points to the participants in the combat.</p></li>
        <li><p>Unless otherwise instructed, or unless you have an option to evade, the next round of combat now starts.</p></li>
        <li><p>Repeat the sequence from <a idref="stage3">Stage 3.</a></p></li>
       </ol>

       <p>This process of combat continues until <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points of either the enemy or Lone Wolf are reduced to zero or below, at which point that combatant is declared dead. If Lone Wolf is dead, the adventure is over. If the enemy is dead, Lone Wolf proceeds but with his <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points possibly reduced.</p>

         <p>During your adventure you may be given the chance to evade combat.

All points lost by the enemy as a result of that round are ignored, and you make your escape. Only Lone Wolf may lose <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points during that round (but then that is the risk of running away!).

     <p>In order to find the quickest route from Vadera to your Kai Monastery you may well have to pass through several wild and dangerous regions of Magnamund. Be wary and on your guard at all times, for the agents of the Dark God Naar are abroad and they will do everything in their power to thwart your safe return.</p>
     <p>Some of the things that you will find or encounter during your mission will be of use to you in this and future <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> books, while others may be red herrings of no real value at all. If you discover items, be selective in what you choose to keep.</p>
     <p>Pick your four Grand Master Disciplines with care for a wise choice will enable any player to complete the quest, no matter how weak their initial <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> and <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> scores may be. Successful completion of previous <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> adventures, although an advantage, is not essential for the completion of this Grand Master adventure.</p>
     <p>May the light of the Gods Kai and Ishir make swift your return to your endangered homeland.</p>

      <p>You set sail from Vadera harbour on a bitterly cold, grey, late winters day. The masts of your host ship, the Lencian clipper <cite>Saxin</cite>, have been rigged with every available square inch of canvas to catch the prevailing winds that will, with luck, propel you quickly to Talestria<ch.emdash/>the first stage of your long journey home. The clipper is a sleek and impressive craft and its departure does not go unnoticed, yet of all the many Lencians who have turned out to watch and wave it farewell, only King Sarnac and his closest advisors know the true purpose of its voyage.</p>
      <p>Once the <cite>Saxin</cite> is beyond the sheltering walls of Vadera harbour, <!--ERRTAG-RE-60736-->its captain<!--/ERRTAG-RE-60736--> charts an easterly course along the Tentarias<ch.emdash/>the chain of seas and landlocked lakes which separate the two continents of Magnamund.

With the aid of a <a idref="map">map</a> which he gives to you, Ardan briefs you on the route you should travel if you are to reach Sommerlund as swiftly as possible. You spend your time discussing the details of the route and pondering the new Evil which now threatens your homeland and the Kai.</p>

You want, most of all, to be with your young Kai acolytes in this dark hour, but fate has seen fit to place a great distance between you. Fearful of what you may find if you arrive home too late, every night you offer up prayers to the Gods Ishir and Kai to help speed your return to Sommerlund.</p>

      <p>It is near dusk when you emerge from the hills and see the glimmering waters of the River Kinam less than five miles distant. This great river marks the border between Talestria and Palmyrion, Queen Evaine<ch.apos/>s neighbouring ally. The road descends to a border toll bridge beyond which you can see the sprawling town of Scade. The troop is challenged by the bridge warden to halt and pay a fee of 100 Silver Lune. This fee is soon forgotten, though, when the Lord Constable shows the pedantic old man his Royal Seal. With a stiff salute he steps aside and bids you all a safe journey.</p>
      <p>Scade is a bustling market town which has grown rich and fat in the years following the defeat of the Darklords. Its brightly painted buildings and paved thoroughfares exude affluence, and even its lowly street-beggars look clean and well-fed by comparison to those in other parts of Magnamund. Nathor leads the troop to an inn near the centre of the town, a fine establishment called <quote>The Lucky Bucket</quote>. Its owner, a corpulent fellow with a polished bald pate, welcomes him with open arms. After the ordeal at Pinepeaks and the long day<ch.apos/>s ride, you are looking forward to a hot bath and a large supper. However, it soon transpires that the inn is almost full and the owner can only provide rooms for five of the troop.</p>
      <p><quote>Not to worry,</quote> says Nathor, noticing the look of disappointment on your face. <quote>I know Knight Tranius<ch.emdash/>the lord of this manor. Many<ch.apos/>s the time we<ch.apos/>ve hunted boar in the hills. His castle is but two miles from here. Five can billet here tonight while the rest of us lodge with Tranius.</quote></p>

      <p>Overhead the sun gleams like a jewel in the clear blue sky, and the early morning air bites with a refreshing sharpness which helps to revive your spirits. A layer of thick frost covers the stony trail from the monastery, and it scrunches loudly under the horses<ch.apos/> hooves as you make your careful descent. Soon you rejoin the east road and follow it, through a series of shallow gorges, to a thick pine forest where the ground is covered with mossy rocks. Here the road ascends to a crest where a pall of black smoke stains the cloudless sky. As you approach the crest, you suddenly sense danger ahead and shout a warning to Nathor. He commands the troop to halt while you go ahead to assess the situation.</p>
      <p>Beyond the crest you see a broad valley with steeply wooded sides. At its centre there is a village and a large stone building which, when you magnify your vision, you determine to be a church. The roof of this building is ablaze and several bodies lie dotted around its cultivated grounds and gardens. You signal to Nathor to join you and, when he arrives upon the crest, he is able to identify the burning church.</p>
      <p><quote>That<ch.apos/>s Pinepeaks Abbey,</quote> he says, his voice stilted with anxiety. <quote>They are in trouble<ch.emdash/>we must help them.</quote></p>

      <p>He calls his men to come forward and, before you can caution him, he leads them at the gallop down the steep trail which descends towards the valley floor. Cursing his impetuosity, you spur your steed onward and follow in his wake. You have covered less than half a mile when suddenly your Magnakai sense of Divination screams a warning<ch.emdash/>the troop is riding directly into an ambush.</p>
      <p>Desperately you shout for Nathor to halt but your command goes unheeded. Then, from out of the surrounding pines, there comes a volley of arrows and spears. One spear penetrates deep into your horse<ch.apos/>s flank, killing him instantly.</p>

      <p>You are about to leave when you overhear the owner of the stables talking to one of his stable-hands. The boy is holding the reins of an aged horse that is severely lame in one leg, and the owner is telling him that he can no longer afford to stable the sick old mare.</p>
      <p><quote>She<ch.apos/>ll have to go,</quote> says the owner, shaking his head. <quote>She<ch.apos/>s worthless to me now she<ch.apos/>s not earning her keep.</quote></p>
      <p>Tears are streaming down the young boy<ch.apos/>s face. Clearly he loves the old horse and is heartbroken at the prospect of her being destroyed. Boldly you approach the owner and propose a deal.</p>

      <p><quote>Sir, if I am able to cure this lame mare,</quote> you say, stroking the horse<ch.apos/>s velvety nose, <quote>then will you allow me to keep her?</quote></p>
      <p><quote>Ha, ha, ha, so you think you can work miracles, do you?</quote> chuckles the owner. <quote>Very well then, stranger. If you can cure her<ch.emdash/>you can keep her.</quote></p>
      <p>Gently you settle the mare and run your hands down her lame foreleg. Using your Magnakai Disciplines of Curing and Animal Control, you slowly ease her worn-out joints and mend her cracked bones. Within minutes she is as agile as a newborn foal.</p>
      <p><quote>Well I be a storgh<ch.apos/>s uncle!</quote> gasps the owner, amazed by the sudden transformation. <quote>So, stranger, you <em>can</em> work miracles after all! The horse is yours!</quote></p>
      <p>You climb upon the mare<ch.apos/>s back and wave farewell to the owner and the stable-boy, who is now crying tears of joy.</p>
      <p><quote>If ever you<ch.apos/>re looking for work,</quote> says the owner, as you turn the horse to leave, <quote>then there<ch.apos/>ll always be a job for you here!</quote></p>

Soon you pick up the trail that leads to <!--ERRTAG-RA-106515-->Raven<ch.apos/>s Eyrie<!--/ERRTAG-RA-106515--> and you follow it for a mile to where it crosses a mountain stream. Mist oozes from the peaty soil, breathing a damp film on the surrounding rocks.</p>

Here you detect a low humming sound and your pulse quickens; you sense you are getting closer to the Shadow Gate. This resonant hum steadily increases in volume the nearer you get to <!--ERRTAG-RA-106515-->Raven<ch.apos/>s Eyrie<!--/ERRTAG-RA-106515-->.

      <p>Throughout your sky voyage home, your mind is filled with the fear and uncertainty of what may await you in Holmgard. You spend most of the journey on the rear deck, alone with your thoughts, staring down at the land speeding past more than a mile below. You watch as the jungle of the Maakenmire swamp gives way to the barren scrub of the Wildlands. Then, when you catch sight of the Pass of Moytura, your pulse races with excitement for this V-shaped cleft in the southern Durncrags is where the Wildland territories end and your beloved homeland of Sommerlund begins. Yet the excitement you feel here is but nothing compared to your elation when you first glimpse the lights of Holmgard<ch.emdash/>the Sommlending capital.</p>

You scan the surrounding landscape and note several small tracks (which lead to tiny farmsteads dotted around the vast plain) converging at a hamlet which nestles in a bend of this great river. During the past hour your horse has developed a slight limp, and a cursory look at his affected leg reveals that he has thrown a shoe. You know that unless you replace the missing shoe, and soon, he will be too lame to carry you further. Reluctantly, you decide to enter the hamlet and go in search of a blacksmith.</p>
      <p>A signpost at the entrance to the hamlet announces its name: Kalma. It is a quiet, sleepy sort of place that in many ways reminds you of Dage, the Sommlending village where you were born and where you spent your early years. Near the centre of this humble village you discover a smithy where, even at this early hour, you can hear the sound of a hammer beating iron. You tether your horse to a rail alongside a moth-eaten old donkey, and call out for the blacksmith.</p>
      <p><quote>In <ch.apos/>ere,</quote> comes the curt reply. On entering you discover a tall, broad-shouldered man clad in a leather apron, busily shaping a horseshoe on an anvil.</p>

The grasslands are rich and fertile, and an abundance of game keeps you well fed during the five days it takes you to ride north to the walled city of Tekaro.

You ride out of the King<ch.apos/>s Citadel at the head of the Guard Cavalry regiment, with Captain D<ch.apos/>Val at your side.

      <p>The Border Rangers come quickly to attention when they see you approaching. Their leader, a sergeant with a battle-wounded leg, warns you that the enemy were seen earlier flying over this area of the forest. You acknowledge his salute, then you give the order for the regiment to form up in column, two abreast, before leading them along the trail and into the Fryelund Forest.</p>
      <p>You have covered less than a mile of this woodland track when you find yourself descending a gentle slope towards a stream, a tributary of the Unoram. There once was a bridge which crossed the watercourse at this point, but it has long since collapsed. Its ancient stones now form a ford which carries the trail over to the far side of the stream.</p>

One building in particular catches your eye: it is a hall perched precariously on the end of a wide wooden jetty. You can hear an old man<ch.apos/>s voice trailing from its open doors, answered by the occasional murmur of a crowd. Inside you discover a wizened old cleric administering to a sick woman whose head is swathed with bandages.

Here you see the courtyard entrance to a grand building whose brick and marble fa<ch.ccedil/>ade is adorned with the <!--ERRTAG-RE-204183-->words <quote>Halls of Learning</quote><!--/ERRTAG-RE-204183-->.</p>
      <p>You enter and ride along a gravelled path which leads to a building where a sign, hanging over its richly-carved oak door, simply <!--ERRTAG-RE-202455-->says <quote>Library</quote><!--/ERRTAG-RE-202455-->. You feel compelled to stop here and, without quite knowing why, you dismount from your horse and tie his reins to a ring which is set into the wall. Then you push open the door and enter the library<ch.apos/>s cool interior.</p>
      <p>Countless thousands of books and parchments crowd the stone shelves of this magnificent library. Your eyes travel along them until they reach another door at the far end of the hall. There, standing framed in its archway, is an old man clad in plain brown robes. He looks at you and smiles knowingly.</p>

      <p>You learn that the Elector has already elicited, on your behalf, the help of High-Mayor Cordas of Casiorn. Cordas is reputedly the richest man in all of Magnamund. Manatine tells you that Cordas has ordered the construction of a sky-vessel to transport you swiftly to Sommerlund.</p>
      <p><quote>This craft is presently being built in Casiorn, and the High-Mayor has sent word that you should go there as quickly as you can. His teams of skilled artisans are working on the craft day and night, and he is confident that it will be completed in fifteen days<ch.apos/> time.</quote></p>
      <p>In times of peace, you would expect the 850-mile ride to Casiorn to take little more than two weeks to complete. But peace, always a fragile state in the Stornlands, has been shattered by Prince Lutha<ch.apos/>s unprovoked attack on Holona, a town through which you had hoped to travel. Anxiously, you ask the Elector how the war against Eldenora will affect your chances of reaching Casiorn swiftly.</p>
      <p><quote>Sadly, I cannot predict the future, Grand Master,</quote> he replies. <quote>The war bodes ill for both our causes. However, I shall do what I am able to speed your journey onwards.</quote></p>

      <p>The cry of the war-dogs grows steadily louder until the Eldenoran archers let them off the leash. Then, like a wave of hellish demons, the yellow-eyed hounds come bounding through the trees, homing-in directly on your scent. The leading war-dog, a great grey beast with teeth that glint like polished daggers, storms through the foliage less than twenty yards from where you are crouching. It fixes you with its gruesome stare and turns towards you.</p>

      <p>Holona is in turmoil. The approach roads and outlying fields are littered with scores of broken wagons, dead horses, and the ruined impediments of war. Palmyrion soldiers sit dejectedly on the frost-hardened earth, their glazed eyes and bandaged limbs bearing grim testimony to the bitter fighting that is taking place just a few miles to the north. Battle-weary officers ride among these exhausted men, cursing and coaxing them in a half-hearted attempt to rally them to arms. Few heed their call.</p>

A broken sign by the roadside says that this place is called Amory, yet the newish track which branches off the road and avoids the city gate tells you that travellers on this road no longer visit here. It has begun to rain again and you are quietly dreading having to spend another night out in the open.

      <p>Stoically you swim against the powerful current and reach the distant shore, breathless and exhausted, but glad to have escaped in one piece from the hostile land of Eldenora.</p>
      <p>Once you have fully recovered, you put on your boots and cloak and take stock of your surroundings. You have emerged from the Storn at a wooded stretch of river bank, less than a mile south of the city of Rhem. You set off along a track heading north and within a few minutes, you catch sight of the <!--ERRTAG-RE-281406-->city's walls<!--/ERRTAG-RE-281406--> and its famous horseshoe-shaped harbour.</p>
      <p>You enter the city by its south gate, using your Kai camouflage skills and your natural stealth to avoid the attentions of the watchful guards. Once inside, you merge with the crowds and soon find yourself in a square that is overshadowed by the twin towers of Rhem Cathedral. An avenue runs along the cathedral<ch.apos/>s south side and, at its far end, your eye is drawn to a rusty suit of armour which stands beside the door to a dingy-looking shop.</p>

      <p>With Sabre Fox at your side, you climb the circular stairs to the Grand Hall of the Tower of the Sun. Excitedly the young Kai Master announces your arrival to the battle-weary Kai who are gathered here, and, at first, they look at you in stunned disbelief. Then the truth of what they see sinks in and they give vent to a loud cheer that can be heard all throughout the monastery.</p>
      <p>The news of your return spreads like wildfire. Two of the first to welcome you back are your friend Guildmaster Banedon, and your trusted advisor Lord Rimoah.</p>
      <p><quote>Thank Ishir you are alive, Banedon,</quote> you say clasping his hand in friendship. <quote>In Holmgard they fear that you and Rimoah were killed aboard your skyship. It gladdens my heart to see this is not so.</quote></p>
      <p><quote>And it warms me to see you safely home, Grand Master,</quote> he replies.</p>
      <p><quote>Though we<ch.apos/>ve been hard-pressed to keep your home safe in your absence,</quote> adds Lord Rimoah, with a wry smile.</p>
      <p><quote>You both have my deepest thanks,</quote> you reply. <quote>You took a great risk in coming to the aid of the Kai. I have seen what became of your skyship, Banedon. You were indeed fortunate to have survived.</quote></p>
      <p><quote>Aye,</quote> he replies, sadly. <quote>Yet, alas, three of my Brotherhood were not so blessed. They perished when the Lavas dragged us from the skies.</quote></p>
      <p><quote>Take heart, Banedon, for their deaths will not be in vain. They shall be avenged.</quote> And with these prophetic words you take the Sun-crystal from your pocket and show it to your grieving friend. <quote>With this crystal I shall destroy the Shadow Gate and put an end to Naar<ch.apos/>s evil plan.</quote></p>
      <p>Together with Banedon and Rimoah, you make a tour of the monastery to assess for yourself the extent of the battle damage. Your presence among the young Kai greatly improves their morale and strengthens their resolve to withstand the Lavas<ch.apos/> siege. You visit every area of the monastery, including the Lore Hall of Solaris where the bodies of those slain in battle have been laid out, awaiting burial. It saddens you to see so many Kai dead and, as you walk among their still ranks, you recognize many in whom you had held high hopes: Spring Rain, Eastwind, Sharp Dove, Deep Heart, Frost Lark, and Firefly. As you turn to leave the Lore Hall, you vow to Banedon and Rimoah that the sacrifice they have made will never be forgotten.</p>

      <p>Your first reaction is to back away from this strange old man and reach for the hilt of your weapon, but then your Kai senses tell you that he means you no harm. You focus your psychic powers at his mind and, in an instant, you sense that he has summoned you here to aid you.</p>
      <p><quote>I am Gwynian the Sage,</quote> he says, meekly. <quote>I am a humble servant of the Gods Kai and Ishir. I seek to help you, Grand Master. Will you not listen to my wisdom?</quote></p>

      <p><quote>Very well, Gwynian, what news have you of Sommerlund?</quote> you ask, sceptically.</p>
      <p><quote>Grave news,</quote> replies the old man, with an ominous tone. He picks up a chart from the table and traces a finger across the intricate lines and calculations that embellish its ancient yellowed surface.</p>
      <p><quote>The Dark God Naar has opened a Shadow Gate in the Durncrag Mountains, a corridor between our world and his. By means of this corridor he has sent a host of winged creatures<ch.emdash/>the Lavas<ch.emdash/>to assail your monastery. It is his plan to destroy the young order of Kai warriors while you are not able to lead them. The Shadow Gate opened at the time of the last full moon and, since then, the Kai Monastery has been attacked many times. Naar<ch.apos/>s servants have your stronghold encircled and cut off from the armies of King Ulnar, who has repeatedly sought to break the siege. Your Kai have withstood the attacks well, Lone Wolf, but they are weakening. Only you can save them now.</quote></p>
      <p><quote>But how?</quote> you ask, shaken by Gwynian<ch.apos/>s account of the events which have occurred during your absence from the monastery. <quote>If the armies of King Ulnar are powerless to break the siege, how can I hope to save my brethren?</quote></p>
      <p><quote>Do not despair, Lone Wolf,</quote> replies Gwynian, reassuringly. <quote>All is not yet lost. You can save your brave order by closing the gate through which Naar sends his Lavas minions.</quote></p>
      <p>You are about to ask how you could possibly achieve this, how you could close the Shadow Gate, but your urgent question is forestalled when Gwynian raises his hand.</p>
      <p><quote>Patience for just a moment, Lone Wolf,</quote> he says, and he allows himself a smile. <quote>I, humble Gwynian, possess the means by which you can thwart the Dark God<ch.apos/>s murderous plan.</quote></p>

During the ride, Lord Nathor voices his grave concern that Eldenoran bandits should be operating in the heart of his country: they have rarely dared to venture this far from home before.

      <p>The road climbs out of the valley and zigzags its way through the forested hills to a high pass. Beyond this pass there stretches a wide expanse of lush grassland where herds of wild deer roam and graze freely. It is late in the afternoon when you catch sight of a procession approaching on the road ahead. Mostly they are men dressed in ragged brown robes, and one is carrying aloft a grimy banner which bears the image of a lightning bolt set upon a full moon.</p>

      <p>After a few minutes the druid ceases to sweep the river<ch.apos/>s edge with his curious-looking device, and you watch him disappear below the parapet of the trench.</p>
      <p>Rather than attempt to exit the water here, you allow the current to carry you a few hundred yards downstream. Here you discover a shallow bay in the river bank which affords you better cover from the nearest enemy trench. Quickly you crawl out of the water and slither like a snake up the muddy bank to drop silently into this trench. A dull-witted Eldenoran is swiftly dispatched with a blow from the edge of your hand, enabling you to move further along this log-walled ditch. Just as you are passing the opening to a makeshift dugout, you sense danger ahead. A single file of Eldenoran swordsmen <!--ERRTAG-RE-303412-->is marching<!--/ERRTAG-RE-303412--> along the trench in your direction: it will only be a matter of seconds before they are close enough to see you.</p>

      <p>You lead the regiment along the trail to where the surrounding forest opens out into a shallow meadow. Along the centre of this grassy clearing there meanders a small stream, where a dozen of the winged creatures are spread unevenly along the muddy banks. They are staring intently at the water, seemingly fascinated by the sight of the trout swimming there, and at first they do not see the regiment approaching. You give the signal to change formation, to form into two lines abreast for the charge. Then you glance at the wooded rise on the far side of the meadow, knowing that beyond this ridge lies your goal<ch.emdash/>the Kai Monastery.</p>
      <p>Suddenly one of the creatures hovering over the stream raises the alarm and his ghastly brothers growl with surprise. Unnervingly, they clack their beaked jaws as they survey the King<ch.apos/>s Cavalry, as if they are relishing the thought of an imminent feast. You order the men to lower their lances and then, with a smile of grim determination on your lips, you spur your horse forward and give voice to your battle-cry: <quote>For Sommerlund and the Kai!</quote></p>
      <p>The King<ch.apos/>s Cavalry sweep down the meadow and engulf the winged horrors, driving their lances through their steely hides. You see two of the creatures disappear beneath a thundering wave of hooves, and another two are caught from behind as they attempt to take to the air. You strike one creature a blow to its head as you gallop across the stream. It glances off its iron-hard skull, but the force is sufficient to stun the beast. As it staggers drunkenly in your wake, Captain D<ch.apos/>Val, who is leading the second line, veers towards it and runs it through with his lance.</p>
      <p>Once you are over the stream, you spur your horse up the grassy rise towards the top of the ridge, now no more than a hundred yards distant. You are within seconds of reaching the crest of the ridge when suddenly one of the creatures comes swooping out of the sky. It fixes you with its glowing eyes and extends its talons as it comes screaming down towards your face.</p>

      <p>You are woken from a fitful slumber by the sound of shouting. Cautiously you part the foliage to see a group of Duadon guardsmen scouring the river bank in search of your body. A brutish garrison sergeant is questioning a scrawny beggar whom he holds by the neck, lifting him several inches off the ground. The beggar, shaking with fear, points a finger towards the wood. The sergeant gives him a sneering smile, then rewards him for his cooperation with a dagger in the guts.</p>

      <p>The road which crosses the plains to the east of the River Phoen is deeply rutted. Fortunately though, it is dry, there having been little rain in these parts for weeks. Progress is good and by midday you and your troop have covered more than thirty miles. You pass many wagons on this road, mostly driven by farmers who are taking their crops to the markets and wharves of Garthen. These wagon drivers seem an unusually loyal and friendly breed; invariably they wave and cheer the moment they recognize the uniforms of Queen Evaine<ch.apos/>s Court Cavalry.</p>
      <p>After a brief rest at a village on the road, you continue your ride across the open plains and descend into a wide valley where a shallow stream winds its way through a mass of reed-beds and willow copses. Beyond this valley, the land becomes increasingly hilly. The sun is almost touching the horizon when you come to a small wayside shrine dedicated to the Goddess Ishir. Here a track leads off to the north and, a mile distant, you can make out the walls and tall bell-tower of a chateau high in the hills.</p>

      <p>You press on through the trees, your senses alert to the slightest sound. After an hour or so, you stumble across a stream where you stop briefly to gulp a mouthful of icy fresh water. Beyond this stream the trees become far denser, offering you better cover from the wandering groups of Eldenorans who seem to be positioned all over this vast timberland. It is not until later that you realize that they have not been posted here; they are deserters, hiding out in the forest to avoid a certain death at the Reloni Bridge.</p>
      <p>By morning, you have covered several miles of forest and avoided all contact with the Eldenorans. Then, shortly before midday, you come across the outlying huts of a fortified town which sits astride a busy woodland trail. A glance at your <a idref="map">map</a> reveals this to be Fabri, an Eldenoran outpost close to the Slovian border. From the top of a pine tree you look down on this settlement which is ringed by a palisade. Five cavalry regiments are camped within its perimeter wall of sharpened logs, and you note several Cener Druids conversing with the regimental commanders. It would seem that Prince Lutha is in league with the evil Plague Lords of Ruel.</p>
      <p>While you are observing Fabri from your vantage point high above, you notice a patrol of horsemen wending their way through the trees towards one of the outlying huts. On arriving, they dismount and enter, leaving their horses tied to a split rail but otherwise unattended. Tempted by the opportunity, you descend the tree and make your way towards the hut.</p>

      <p>At close quarters, the city of Amory gives off an odour of disease and decay. Its flagstoned streets are cracked and broken open by plants, the roofs of its once-fine houses have long since caved in, and every surface is damp and mildewed. It is also completely deserted; even the rats have left.</p>
      <p>You seek shelter in one of the few buildings with a roof still intact. The furnishings that you discover here are made of the finest Durenese oak and Salonese leather, but none withstand your weight. Everything has rotted and falls to shreds at a touch. You are clearing debris from the floor to make a place to sleep when suddenly you hear hoofbeats in the street outside. You rush to the open door and see, to your shocked surprise, a ghostly rider astride a black horse come galloping down the narrow avenue. Tongues of red flame shoot from the horse<ch.apos/>s nostrils and it leaves in its wake a trail of green mist.</p>

      <p>The numbing blast leaves you slumped against the wall of the pit. Rather than invite a second devastating blast from Lutha<ch.apos/>s Ring of Power, you pretend to be dead in the hope that you may be able to escape when Lutha<ch.apos/>s guards come to dispose of your body.</p>
      <p>High above you, you hear Prince Lutha howling delightedly at the sight of your seemingly dead corpse. He calls for his guards and, a few minutes later, you hear them entering the pit. There follows the tinny sound of metal scraping on metal before you feel yourself being lifted by the shoulders and feet and lowered into a slippery chute. A wave of panic makes you open your eyes and struggle to break free of their grip. This sudden and unexpected resurrection in turn makes the guards scream and drop you. They scurry away, gibbering like idiots, and you are left to slide headlong down a chute which leads to a fast-flowing underground river. You hit the cold waters head-first and are carried swiftly away by the strong undercurrent.</p>

      <p>You tumble head-first down the slope and knock yourself unconscious on a jagged outcrop. Minutes later, the halo of energy which surrounds the Shadow Gate begins to crackle fiercely. The surge of energy has great significance, for on the Plane of Darkness, Naar has just consigned his newest champions to the Shadow Gate through which you escaped from his realm.</p>
      <p>As the first rays of the dawn sun spread across the surrounding rocks, the first of Naar<ch.apos/>s mighty dragon herd emerge from the Shadow Gate. Drawn by the glow of the Sun-crystal, they descend on your unconscious form and, in a frenzy of retribution, they rend you limb from limb.</p>

      <p>From the cover of the trees, you first use your Magnakai Nexus Discipline to cause one of the horse<ch.apos/>s reins to become untied from the rail. Then you summon the steed using your Animal Mastery. The horse responds without hesitation and soon you are back in the saddle once more, heading south in a wide arc around the Eldenoran settlement at Fabri.</p>
      <p>During your ride through the woodland, you discover the following items in the bags and blanket roll which are attached to the saddle:</p>

      </signpost>
      <p>You are anxious to leave hostile Eldenoran territory as soon as possible and, after checking your <a idref="map">map</a>, you set off to the south, towards the Slovian border town of Tenzha.</p>

      <p>You pull away from the bitter green cloud and fall back towards the cell door. Your Magnakai Discipline of Nexus offers some protection from this highly poisonous gas, but you are not completely safe from its effect: lose 5 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points.</p>
      <p>The gaoler and Lord Nathor were standing several paces from the prisoner when he exhaled, yet even so they are affected by the insidious poison. Choking and retching, they collapse to the floor, their fingers scrabbling at their swelling throats as they fight desperately for breath. You grab hold of their tunics, one in each hand, and drag their bodies out of the cell into the cleaner air of the corridor beyond. Here you use your <!--ERRTAG-RE-390142-->Magnakai Discipline of Curing<!--/ERRTAG-RE-390142--> to ease the effects of the poison gas; your skill and the swiftness of your actions undoubtedly save them from a painful, suffocating death.</p>

      <p>From the crystal ring there pours forth a torrent of energy, a crackling vortex of evil power that whirls around and around the wall of the circular shaft as it slowly descends towards you. Tugging the Sommerswerd from its scabbard, you hold the golden blade aloft and brace yourself for the moment the two powers collide. The tip of the swirling vortex is drawn to your blade like lightning to a conductor, and upon the instant it touches the tip, there is a blinding flash. An electrifying jolt runs through your body and a deafening screech splits the air. For a terrifying moment the tip of the Sommerswerd becomes molten and begins to lose its rigidity, then there is another flash, and the power of the ring rebounds from your divine blade and returns towards its source, conquered and repelled by the goodly might of the Sword of the Sun.</p>

      <p><quote>Grave news,</quote> replies Gwynian, with an ominous tone. He picks up a chart from the table and traces a finger across the intricate lines and calculations that embellish its ancient yellowed surface.</p>
      <p><quote>The Dark God Naar has opened a Shadow Gate in the Durncrag Mountains, a corridor between our world and his. By means of this corridor he has sent a host of winged creatures<ch.emdash/>the Lavas<ch.emdash/>to assail your monastery. It is his plan to destroy the young order of Kai warriors while you are not able to lead them. The Shadow Gate opened at the time of the last full moon and, since then, the Kai Monastery has been attacked many times. Naar<ch.apos/>s servants have your stronghold encircled and cut off from the armies of King Ulnar, who has repeatedly sought to break the siege. Your Kai have withstood the attacks well, Lone Wolf, but they are weakening. Only you can save them now.</quote></p>
      <p><quote>But how?</quote> you ask, shaken by Gwynian<ch.apos/>s account of the events which have occurred during your absence from the monastery. <quote>If the armies of King Ulnar are powerless to break the siege, how can I hope to save my brethren?</quote></p>
      <p><quote>Do not despair, Lone Wolf,</quote> replies Gwynian, reassuringly. <quote>All is not yet lost. You can save your brave order by closing the gate through which Naar sends his Lavas minions.</quote></p>
      <p>You are about to ask how you could possibly achieve this, how you could close the Shadow Gate, but your urgent question is forestalled when Gwynian raises his hand.</p>
      <p><quote>Patience for just a moment, Lone Wolf,</quote> he says and he allows himself a smile. <quote>I, humble Gwynian, possess the means by which you can thwart the Dark God<ch.apos/>s murderous plan.</quote></p>

      <p>While riding the road to Duadon, you search the bags which hang from the saddle of your newfound horse. Among the things they contain are a spare Eldenoran uniform and rain-cape. You throw the uniform away, but you sling the voluminous cape around your shoulders and fix the clasp under your chin. Mindful of the increased risks of detection the nearer you get to Duadon, this simple black cape serves two useful purposes: it keeps hidden your Kai clothes and gives you the outward appearance of an Eldenoran horseman. (You need not record this cape on your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>.)</p>
      <p>Among the other items you discover in the saddle-bags are:</p>
      <ul>
       <li>Enough food for 2 Meals</li>
       <li>Mace</li>
       <li>Rope</li>
       <li>Tinderbox</li>
       <li>8 Lune (equivalent to 2 Gold Crowns)</li>
       <li>Mirror</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If you decide to keep any of these items, remember to adjust your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a> accordingly.</p>
      <p>During the remaining daylight hours, you frequently see units of Eldenorans on the road, most marching westwards with long pikes over their shoulders. None of them challenge you as you pass them by, for they assume you are a cavalry scout going about his duty. After spending a comfortable night in the loft of a deserted hay barn, you continue your ride at first light and reach the outskirts of Duadon shortly before midday.</p>
      <p>The Eldenoran capital is a grey and unlovely place. Its cold stone buildings bear the scars of a city whose history is one of near-continual warfare. The roads leading to the city gates are crowded with regiments on the move, and soon you find yourself caught up to a large body of troops which is snaking slowly towards Duadon<ch.apos/>s heavily fortified western approach. The mood of the troops is one of studied indifference, a condition which often prevails in those who have become emotionally numbed by the horrors of war. As this sullen mass moves through the west gate, you glance up at the battlements and notice a red-robed figure clutching a long staff of glowing white metal. A tingle of apprehension runs the length of your spine when you recognize the figure to be a Cener Druid. The staff he holds radiates a magical aura and you sense at once that he is scanning the arriving soldiers, using the staff to determine, amongst other things, if any have contracted plague. Suddenly the Cener becomes agitated and he sprints the length of the battlements to sound an alarm bell. Within a few moments, the west gate is sealed by a heavy iron portcullis and panic sweeps through the troops who have been shut outside. You look up at the battlements once more and this time your heart skips a beat; the Cener is pointing his glowing staff directly at your head.</p>

      <p>You accept Cearmaine<ch.apos/>s offer and, within the hour, you and he are on the road once more, this time riding north on horseback towards the battle that is raging at the Reloni Bridge. When you are three miles from the river you can see the night sky lit up by the fires of war. At two miles, the sounds of singing steel and dying men can be heard on the wind. At a mile distant, you see fields littered with the wounded and dying recently evacuated from the front, and regiments of young Palmyrion reserves nervously awaiting their turn to go forward. And when at last you catch sight of the bridge itself, your stomach churns as you witness the carnage being wrought there.</p>
      <p>The bridge, and the surrounding banks of the river, are carpeted with dead and dying men, twisted into impossible shapes. Massive engines of war bombard the soldiers on both sides, raining fiery death and destruction upon their heads. You have seen many battles in your time, but none to rival the savagery of the conflict that is unfolding here.</p>
      <p>Cearmaine catches hold of a young lieutenant whose face is covered with dried blood. Part of his scalp has been sliced away but he seems unaware of his gaping wound. Cearmaine barks a question and the man answers him by pointing to a regiment of pikemen stationed on a distant hill.</p>
      <p><quote>There stand the Black Ravens<ch.emdash/>my son<ch.apos/>s men. I must away now, Grand Master, so I bid you farewell. The enemy have been repulsed this last hour and are gathering themselves for their next attack. If you are determined to cross the water to their side, you should attempt it now, before they advance again.</quote> Cearmaine turns his horse about and makes ready to ride off. <quote>By the Gods, Grand Master, you are brave to have chosen this road home!</quote> he says, saluting you. <quote>I wish you luck<ch.emdash/>may Kai and Ishir keep you safe. Farewell, my friend. Farewell!</quote></p>
      <p>As the captain gallops away, you look with mounting dread at the slaughter. To cross the river by the bridge is impossible; the only ways across are either upstream to the north, or downstream to the south. To the north you see a dense wall of trees on the far bank, which, judging by the number of arrow-struck bodies lying nearby, you hazard is full of enemy archers. To the south, the far shore is a mass of heavily fortified trenches filled to overflowing with Eldenoran assault troops.</p>

      <p>As the last of your attackers collapses at your feet, you turn and run headlong down the steep hill track. Arrows and spears whistle past on all sides as you endeavour to outrun the remaining ambushers. By dint of luck and speed, Nathor and his troop of court cavalry have survived the Eldenoran ambush with little injury and no loss of life. You see them in the distance, gathered in a group on the valley floor, and you wave to them to show that you are still alive. Immediately Nathor gallops away from the troop and comes speeding up the track to your rescue. As he gets nearer he slows his horse to allow you to leap astride its rump. Once aboard, he pulls his steed about and descends once more towards the valley floor, cheered on by his anxious men.</p>

You glance over your shoulder and see them spur their steeds forward, their faces set in expressions of grim determination.

Some are cradling the bodies of their dead menfolk who lie scattered in the fields nearby. Then you catch sight of a group of Eldenorans in the grounds of the abbey. All are laden with loot, yet even so there are some who are squabbling amongst themselves in an effort to grab an even bigger share of the booty.</p>
      <p>Nathor brings his steed to a halt and you both quickly dismount. As your feet touch the ground, you notice a drunken Eldenoran come lurching out of the doorway of a nearby cottage. He has a flagon of ale in one hand and a young woman, with a crying baby in the other. He sees you and, in a moment of drunken panic, he drops the flagon and unsheathes a dagger from his belt. It is clear from his actions that he intends to stab the screaming child.</p>

      <p>The stench of the circular pit is almost unbearable. The floor is covered with a brackish green slime in which a host of flea-infested rats are scratching for food. In the dim half-light you watch with a mixture of fascination and revulsion as these vicious rats burrow nose-first into the evil-smelling mire, pausing only to fight when one of them uncovers the prey that they are hunting for: glistening, black-bodied worms.</p>
      <p>Using your Magnakai skill of Nexus, you are able to free your hands from the cords that bind them. Escape from this pit is now foremost in your mind. Beyond the wall you can hear the sound of rushing water and, when you move to where the sound is loudest, you discover a panel partially concealed by slime. A closer inspection reveals it to be an opening to a circular chute. You are working on a way to prise open this panel, hoping it will lead to a way out of the pit, when suddenly there is a grating rumble high above. A column of bright light invades the gloom and, squealing with fright, the rats burrow frantically into the slime to avoid it.</p>
      <p><quote>Well well, if it isn<ch.apos/>t Grand Master Lone Wolf himself!</quote> booms a man<ch.apos/>s voice from the top of the shaft. <quote>How good of you to come to Duadon in person. You have saved me the further expense of having you hunted down and brought here in chains.</quote></p>
      <p>Quickly your eyes grow accustomed to the light and you see, peering over the lip of an open trapdoor at the top of the shaft, the sneering face of a young man. His pointed beard and moustache are trimmed to perfection, and his dark eyes twinkle with a cold malevolence that places a chill in your very soul. His skin is unusually pale and, judging from the wealth of gold embellishment that bedecks the neck of his velvet tunic, you feel sure that he is Prince Lutha, the self-appointed ruler of this city.</p>
      <p><quote>What do you intend for me?</quote> you ask aloud, but silently you are dreading his answer. The Prince does not reply directly, he simply utters a soft, chilling laugh as he extends his right hand. On his index finger you see a glowing ring of green crystal and, in a moment of terror, you realize that it is an artefact of pure evil, fashioned by, and imbued with, the power of the Dark God Naar himself.</p>

      <p>You reach the city of Vanamor late in the evening, long after the sun has set beyond the western horizon. The guards at the west gate do not, at first, look kindly upon a travel-stained rider of unknown origin, but when you show them the Star of Palmyrion<ch.emdash/>the medal that their leader, the Elector Manatine, awarded you for your victory over the evil druids of Ruel<ch.emdash/>their cold attitude undergoes a dramatic change. The guard sergeant apologizes profusely and escorts you personally through the capital<ch.apos/>s streets, past a well-ordered collection of dwellings and public buildings, to a grand palatial edifice in the city<ch.apos/>s northern quarter. It is the Elector<ch.apos/>s Hall<ch.emdash/>the seat of the Palmyrion republic.</p>
      <p>Trumpets announce your arrival as you stride through the hall<ch.apos/>s great arched doors. Senators and officials stop momentarily to stare, then their attentions return to their affairs of state which strike you as unusually urgent. It is almost midnight, yet the Elector<ch.apos/>s Hall is a buzzing hive of activity. You meet with Elector Manatine in his War Room where he and his generals are poring over maps and battle reports. He welcomes you with a warm handshake but his countenance seems unusually dour and agitated. You are soon to learn why.</p>

      <p>You leave the cell and return to the State Hall where Lord Constable Nathor reports what has happened to the Queen. Concerned for your safety, she suggests that you spend the night at the Royal Citadel as her guest. You accept her gracious invitation and enjoy a fine feast and the hospitality of her court. Then, shortly after dawn of the following day, you bid <!--ERRTAG-RE-484881-->her Majesty<!--/ERRTAG-RE-484881-->, and your companion<ch.emdash/>Lord Ardan<ch.emdash/>a fond farewell before beginning the next stage of your long journey home.</p>
      <p>Mindful of the dangers, the Queen gives her Lord Constable a Royal Seal and places him, along with a troop of ten court cavalrymen, at your disposal. Lord Nathor and his men are to act as your guides and bodyguards on the road to Vanamor, the capital city of neighbouring Palmyrion. This republic is closely allied to Talestria and lies along its eastern border. Palmyrion also has close ties with your homeland and you look forward to the chance of renewing your friendship with its leader, Elector Manatine.</p>
      <p>Mounted on fine Talestrian steeds, your party leaves the walled city of Garthen by its East Gate and sets off towards the outlying village of Sharr. Here you cross the mighty River Phoen by way of a great stone bridge. On the far side of this bridge you notice a signpost which points to the east.

      <p>It is near midnight when you arrive at a ridge which commands a view of the mighty River Storn. Moonlight pours molten silver over the rushing water, illuminating a ford where a crossing can be made over this unusually deep and fast-flowing river. To the far horizon stretch the plains of Slovia, peaceful and inviting. You long to be on the other side, but you suspect that crossing here, despite the ford, will not be an easy task. Heavily fortified border posts stand at the approaches to the ford, and many keen-eyed sentries are scanning the surrounding countryside on both sides of the river. The Eldenorans are watching for deserters attempting to flee to the safety of Slovia, a neutral territory in the war against Palmyrion; the Slovians keep watch for signs of an Eldenoran attack. It would not be the first time an invasion by their hostile neighbour had come this way.</p>
      <p>Patiently you observe the ford for more than an hour, trying to determine the optimum time to make your move, but then suddenly the choice is taken out of your hands. In the middle distance you see an Eldenoran patrol riding towards the ridge. Unless you abandon the ridge at once, they will be sure to see you and raise an alarm.</p>

You rush headlong into the forest and glance overhead to make doubly sure that you are not being tracked by more of the winged Lavas. The darkening sky is clear of the enemy and confidently you press on through the trees, sure in your ability to remain undetected now that you are in your natural environment of the forest.</p>
      <p>Soon you reach the clearing and hurry to a boulder which bears the imprint of a human hand. You place your right hand upon it and the imprint fits around it like a glove. Silently a hinged stone slab rises up from the ground revealing a stair that leads down into a brick-lined passageway. You enter and hurry along this familiar tunnel, covering a mile before you come to a door that opens automatically at your approach. Beyond lies the Vault of the Sun, your personal stronghold. It radiates a <!--ERRTAG-RE-488088-->warm golden light<!--/ERRTAG-RE-488088-->: the rays of the Lorestones of Nyxator. Once safely inside your underground lair, you pause to allow the radiant light of the Lorestones to wash over your tired and aching limbs and, within the space of a few heartbeats, the fatigue of your long journey home is melted away (restore all lost <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points).</p>

      <p><quote>Grave news,</quote> replies Gwynian, with an ominous tone. He picks up a chart from the table and traces a finger across the intricate lines and calculations that embellish its ancient yellowed surface.</p>
      <p><quote>The Dark God Naar has opened a Shadow Gate in the Durncrag Mountains, a corridor between our world and his. By means of this corridor he has sent a host of winged creatures<ch.emdash/>the Lavas<ch.emdash/>to assail your monastery. It is his plan to destroy the young order of Kai warriors while you are not able to lead them. The Shadow Gate opened at the time of the last full moon and, since then, the Kai Monastery has been attacked many times. Naar<ch.apos/>s servants have your stronghold encircled and cut off from the armies of King Ulnar, who has repeatedly sought to break the siege. Your Kai have withstood the attacks well, Lone Wolf, but they are weakening. Only you can save them now.</quote></p>
      <p><quote>But how?</quote> you ask, shaken by Gwynian<ch.apos/>s account of the events which have occurred during your absence from the monastery. <quote>If the armies of King Ulnar are powerless to break the siege, how can I hope to save my brethren?</quote></p>
      <p><quote>Do not despair, Lone Wolf,</quote> replies Gwynian, reassuringly. <quote>All is not yet lost. You can save your brave order by closing the gate through which Naar sends his Lavas minions.</quote></p>
      <p>You are about to ask how you could possibly achieve this, how you could close the Shadow Gate, but your urgent question is forestalled when Gwynian raises his hand.</p>
      <p><quote>Patience for just a moment, Lone Wolf,</quote> he says, and he allows himself a smile. <quote>I, humble Gwynian, possess the means by which you can thwart the Dark God<ch.apos/>s murderous plan.</quote></p>

The burnt remains of men, women, and children are heaped in small mounds all over the farmyard. Open trenches, containing fire-blackened bones and skulls, have been dug in lines behind the farmhouse, and cattle carcasses fill the ditches which border the muddy road into the town. You detect no life at all, not even a bird or lowly farm animal wanders freely here.</p>

For a few moments you hear a terrible, far-off scream: it is the lonely cry of Naar himself, lamenting the destruction of his dragon herd, which, by your action, you have consigned to oblivion. The vortex continues to whirl but it is growing smaller as its collapsing power fades. It shrinks and shrinks until, with a final <onomatopoeia>Crack</onomatopoeia>! it disappears completely.</p>
      <p>You return to the monastery where, upon your arrival at the north gate, you are treated to the loud and joyous applause of the young Kai warriors. Banedon and Rimoah praise and congratulate you for your victory over the minions of Naar; it is a victory that will long be remembered in the history of Sommerlund and the legends of the Kai.</p>
