    <p><strong>1990-1998</strong><br />Rise of global terrorism on an unprecedented scale. Political violence funded by organized crime syndicate called HAVOC<ch.emdash/>The Hijack, Assassination and Violent Opposition Consortium.</p>
    <p><strong>1998-2003</strong><br />The governments of many small and impoverished nations fall into the hands of HAVOC. International terrorists receive arms, training, and shelter in these Badlands.</p>
    <p><strong>2003-2008</strong><br />Raids on oil and gas installations, assassinations, and the kidnapping of prominent world statesmen become commonplace as HAVOC attempt to terrorize the civilized world into submission. Despite public outrage and growing international tension, the major powers steadfastly refuse to give in to HAVOC's demands.</p>
    <p><strong>2008</strong><br />President of the United States and General Secretary of Supreme Soviet both assassinated at emergency summit meeting. US, USSR and major European nations create the World Defence League and declare war on HAVOC. The Badlands are invaded, key HAVOC bases destroyed, and thousands of HAVOC agents are captured.</p>
    <p><strong>2009</strong><br />HAVOC leaders imprisoned for life in `Deep Pens'<ch.emdash/>maximum security gaols located deep underground<ch.emdash/>to prevent their escape or release by HAVOC agents still at large.</p>
    <p><strong>2010</strong><br />New leadership emerges to unify the scattered remnants of HAVOC and plan revenge.</p>
    <p><strong>2011</strong><br />A WDL train transporting seventeen 100-kiloton nuclear warheads, destined to be neutralized and dismantled, is attacked by HAVOC agents. The train is destroyed and its deadly cargo stolen.</p>
    <p><strong>2012 New Year's Day</strong><br />HAVOC hijack a WDL news satellite and broadcast a chilling ultimatum.  They have planted the seventeen stolen warheads in major cities throughout the US, USSR   and Europe.  They call for the immediate release of all HAVOC agents held in Deep Pens, plus the payment of $2 trillion in gold bullion, or they will trigger the warheads one by one until their demands are met in full.  A twenty-four-hour deadline is set. WDL leaders declare emergency and request that the deadline be extended.  HAVOC refuse.</p>
    <p><strong>2nd January</strong><br />First warhead detonated at Brie Nuclear Energy Plant, ten miles south of Paris, France. Blast and radioactive fallout claim millions of lives.  HAVOC repeat their demand and extend deadline by twenty-four hours.</p>
    <p><strong>3rd January 'The Day'</strong><br />World Defence League agents discover location of HAVOC command headquarters on an island in the South Pacific Ocean.  Immediately orders are given to infiltrate and destroy the HQ and its occupants. The assault is swift and decisive', the complex is quickly overrun and its inhabitants are killed. Yet, ironically, as the news of this victory is being relayed around the world, HAVOC enact their ultimate revenge. A transmitter hidden on the island, fitted with a time-delay mechanism, clicks on, sending its high-frequency radio signal to a communications satellite orbiting the earth. This signal is amplified and returned to earth where, simultaneously, it triggers the remaining nuclear warheads. The initial explosions set off a disastrous chain reaction that feeds on civil and military nuclear installations all across the northern hemisphere. Hundreds of millions of people are killed within days, and many more perish during the years that follow, falling victim to the lingering radioactivity and the severe climatic changes that affect the earth.</p>
    <p><strong>2012-2019</strong><br />Gale force winds sweep across the world, carrying enormous amounts of dust into the upper atmosphere and preventing much sunlight from reaching the earth's surface.  Temperatures plummet, deterring survivors from remaining above ground.  Communications are disrupted by gamma radiation, making all radio, cable and satellite contact impossible. Small colonies of survivors develop in total isolation from one another during these years of darkness.</p>
    <p><strong>2019-2020</strong><br />Gradually, the dust storms die down and the sun penetrates the atmosphere, thawing the earth's frozen surface. Radiation decays to tolerable levels, and survivors emerge to reclaim what little remains of the world they once knew.</p>

   <data>
    <p>You are Cal Phoenix, a survivor, born in California on Thanksgiving Day in the year AD 2000. In 2012, whilst on winter vacation at your Uncle Jonas and Aunt Betty-Ann's ranch in Texas, you were invited to visit a shale-oil mine near Austin, the first of its kind in Texas. As Chief-of-Construction, your uncle was proud to take you on a guided tour of the whole underground complex, which, for security reasons, was totally self-supporting. It was during this tour on 3rd January 2012, that the holocaust began.</p>
    <p>You remember how the ground shuddered when the shock waves of the first distant explosions reached the mine and how you thought it was the start of an earthquake, such as you had experienced many times at home in California. But as the levels nearest the surface began to collapse and the central elevator shaft filled with rubble, you realized the awful truth.  At first there was no way of telling the extent of the surface devastation. Below ground, the safety generators had automatically switched into operation when the main power supply failed, and the tremors had faded quickly, which encouraged your aunt and uncle to believe that the damage above was superficial. Uncle Jonas was confidant that the military would mount a rescue operation and that you would be brought out within a few days, a week at the most. Aunt Betty-Ann too was optimistic.  After all, there were emergency supplies, enough to feed 200 men for a whole month.  Little did she know that the three of you would end up consuming all those supplies, or that the mine would become your home, your shelter and your prison for the next eight years of your lives.</p>

    <p>It was early September in the year 2019 when eventually you broke through to the surface. The landscape surrounding the mine looked like the surface of another planet. Few structures had survived the blizzards and intense cold that had swept around the world in the years following 'The Day', and now, after the dust had settled and the sun returned, the once-fertile plains of Austin resembled little more than a desert of parched and broken rock, littered with the artefacts of an absent civilization.  During the first few days, when you set out to explore this wilderness, it was easy to believe that you were the only survivors. But on the morning of the fifth day Uncle Jonas made chance radio contact with a family called Ewell, who were living near the ruins of McKinney, thirty miles north of Dallas.  They told him that they had been in touch with a handful of other groups, who had managed somehow to survive the holocaust. Most were isolated, unable to move due to lack of fuel, food, or water. They had urged those who could travel to join them in McKinney, to start a new community there, and some were already on their way. When your uncle and aunt accepted their invitation, the Ewells were enthusiastic but they also warned you to be wary<ch.emdash/>not everyone who had survived wanted to establish a new community. The ruins of some large Texan cities, such as Dallas and Fort Worth, were controlled by gangs of criminals who fought with each other and terrorized anyone seeking to re-establish law and order. They urged you to avoid these gangs at all costs.</p>
    <p>It took more than a week to discover a vehicle capable of transporting you to McKinney. It was an old school bus parked in an underground lot where it had survived the years of sub-zero blizzards. With fuel and spares salvaged from the mine, you managed to coax it back to life, whereupon you set off on your journey north. When you arrived at the town, it was easy to find where the Ewells lived, for their ranch was the only place that was still standing. It looked more like an old frontier post than a ranch, with its fortified perimeter wall, lookout posts and stake-filled moat. However, after being ambushed and shot at by the city gangs of Fort Worth during the final stages of your journey, you could readily understand the need for these defences.</p>
    <p>'Pop' Ewell, the seventy-year-old grandfather of the Ewell family, was the leader of this small colony of survivors, and it was he who had urged Uncle Jonas to join them when your uncle had first made radio contact. The colony numbered less than a dozen at the time of your arrival, yet as the airwaves became clearer and new contacts were made, the number had soon more than doubled to twenty-five. It was decided that a name was needed to identify the settlement. The name 'Dallas Colony One' was adopted<ch.emdash/>'DC1' for short<ch.emdash/>and from that day on, everyone worked hard to make DC1 a secure haven for those seeking refuge from the hostile wastelands and marauding city gangs.</p>
    <p>'Cutter' Jacks was one such refugee. Before 'The Day' he had been chief mechanic at the International Grand Prix Circuit near Lake Dallas, and his incredible skill and knowledge of engines was soon to prove invaluable to the colony. He taught you how to drive, and from a pile of old wrecks that you helped him salvage from the circuit, he built you a powerful, customized car. You used it to patrol the highways north of the city, keeping a lookout for gangs of city punks who frequently mounted raids to steal or destroy DC1's supplies. Cutter also taught you to shoot, and it was your natural prowess with a gun, and your skill behind the wheel, that was to earn you the begrudging respect of your enemies, who took to calling you the 'Freeway Warrior'.</p>
    <p>Six months after your arrival at DC1, the colony was faced with a major crisis. A heat wave caused a drought that threatened to destroy the food supply.  Crops were failing and the colony's artesian well<ch.emdash/>its only source of uncontaminated water<ch.emdash/>was beginning to dry up. The drought was also provoking more attacks from the city punks who were desperate for food and water. Their common need had united them and now they posed a very real threat to the security of DC1. It was the last day of May, 2020, when Pop Ewell made radio contact with another colony, who were based in the city of Big Spring, 300 miles west of McKinney. Their situation was completely the reverse of DC1's: they had food and water in plentiful supply but they were desperately short of fuel. They told of their contact with survivors in Tucson, Arizona, who also were without fuel. The Tucson colony reported that the territories west of the Sierra Nevada Mountains had been spared the worst effects of the radioactive blizzards that had devastated the rest of the country and, miraculously, much of southern California was still widely populated: it had survived the last eight years virtually intact. When you heard the news, you could hardly believe your ears. Perhaps your family as still alive; perhaps there was still a chance that one day you would be reunited.</p>

    <p>A meeting was held to decide how best to deal with the crisis facing DCl.  Everyone agreed that staying at McKinney could lead only to eventual death, either slowly from starvation or suddenly at the hands of the murderous city gangs. The only choice open to DC1 was to try to reach California: only there lay any real hope for the future of the colony. The decision was relayed to the survivors at Big Spring, and a deal was struck to rendezvous with them as soon as possible. DC1 would give them fuel in exchange for food and water, and together they would join up with the Tucson colony for the final stage of the journey to California.</p>
    <p>Careful preparations were made for the long trek, and three vehicles were chosen to make up the convoy: the school bus, your customized roadster and a gasolene tanker laden with 5,000 gallons of petroleum siphoned from underground storage tanks at the Ewell ranch. Supplies of food and water were adequate but the colony lacked sufficient firearms and ammunition with which to defend itself. On the day before the convoy was due to leave, one of the colonists was sent north to search the town of Sherman for weapons. He radioed back to say that he had found a cache of hunting rifles and ammunition, but that his truck had broken down and he was stranded in the town. He had also found a survivor<ch.emdash/>a beautiful teenage girl<ch.emdash/>and he requested that you go to Sherman to pick them both up. As soon as you arrived you were ambushed by the scouts of a brutal gang of bikers known as the Detroit Lions and, in the ensuing gun battle, you killed Stinger<ch.emdash/>the scouts' leader.</p>
    <p>Later you learned that the girl, Kate Norton, was the sole survivor of a Kansas City colony that had been attacked and wiped out by the Detroit Lions. The Lions' leader, who calls himself Mad Dog Michigan, had taken a liking to her and spared her life. Mad Dog was once a high-ranking HAVOC agent who had escaped from Pontiac Deep Pen near Detroit, and he and his gang, most of whom were also HAVOC escapees, were heading for the Fort Hood Military Reserve near Killeen, Texas, the largest armoury in the whole of the United States. There he hoped to find enough weapons to equip the other HAVOC clans, who were now in control of cities all along the eastern seaboard. Kate had managed to steal a motorcycle and escape from their camp, but Mad Dog was determined to get her back. He sent his brother<ch.emdash/>Stinger<ch.emdash/>and a handful of his best scouts to track her down, and they had finally caught up with her at Sherman.</p>
    <p>When Mad Dog learned that you had killed his brother, he vowed to get even with you. He abandoned his plans to loot Fort Hood and embarked instead on a relentless pursuit of your colony as it crossed the sun-scorched wastelands of Texas. The journey to Big Spring was fraught with great danger and yet, in spite of the many perils you faced, or perhaps because of them, you felt yourself falling in love with Kate and you sensed that she was becoming increasingly fond of you. Sadly, the convoy was only a few miles from Big Spring when disaster struck. The land surrounding the settlement was controlled by a gang of bikers, a renegade clan called the 'Mavericks', who had been the bane of the Big Spring colony for many months. As the convoy drew nearer to its destination, the Mavericks launched an attack, and, in the running battle that ensued, they captured and abducted Kate. The convoy entered the fortified gates of Big Spring to a rapturous welcome from the colonists of that settlement, but for you the celebration was soured by the vivid memory of Kate's abduction. You vowed to rescue her, and from that moment on every waking minute of every day at Big Spring was spent thinking about little else.</p>

    </illustration>
    
    <p>By chance it transpired that the leader of the Mavericks, a blond-haired murderer called Amex Gold, was a former HAVOC agent, who had served under Mad Dog Michigan before 'The Day'. He offered to join forces with the Lions and, as a gesture of his loyalty to his former commander, he returned Kate to him. Together the Lions and the Mavericks launched a hasty attack on Big Spring, yet, although they outnumbered the colony by more than three to one, they were unable to breach the settlement's fortified perimeter wall and were repelled with heavy losses. On the day after the attack, Pop Ewell discovered the radio frequency that the clansmen were using and was able to eavesdrop on their communications. He learned that Mad Dog had ordered another HAVOC clan, the Saints, who were based in New Orleans, to come to reinforce his command; they were expected to arrive within the week. He also overheard Mad Dog arrange a meeting with Mekong Mike, the leader of the Angelinos, a gang who controlled the city of San Angelo. He wanted him as an ally and was prepared to offer guns and ammunition in return for his help in destroying the Big Spring colony. Two days later, Mad Dog Michigan set off for San Angelo at the head of a motorcycle pack 200 riders strong. Those few clansmen who remained with Amex Gold tried all manner of tricks to convince the colony that the Mavericks and the Lions still surrounded Big Spring in strength, but to no avail. The senior members of the newly enlarged colony convened a meeting, at which it was decided that, with the clansmen now at their weakest, and with the appearance of the New Orleans gang expected at any time, a breakout had to be attempted without delay. There was only one way for the colony to reach Tucson overland and that was to follow the remains of Interstate Freeway 10 through the arid, mountainous territory of western Texas. Precisely halfway between Big Spring and Tucson lies the city of El Paso. To reach this city in one piece became the convoy's goal. It lay at the end of a long and tortuous stretch of mountain highway, undoubtedly one of the toughest you would have to face on your journey to California.</p>
    <p>Under cover of darkness, the convoy escaped from Big Spring and sped westwards. Now your vow to rescue Kate could at last be realized and, at the first opportunity, you told the colony of your plans.  Reluctantly they let you leave the convoy and go to San Angelo, where you intended to infiltrate the meeting between the Lions and the Angelinos in the hope of finding Kate there. Your skill and daring were rewarded, for you were able to locate and rescue Kate from under the very noses of the clan leaders. During your escape from their city, you killed Mekong Mike, the Angelinos' leader, and stole a map from Mad Dog Michigan. Later you discovered that this map contained vital details of a HAVOC operation to take over the whole of the United States.</p>
    <p>As you escaped westwards from San Angelo, you encountered three soldiers, survivors from a world Defence League outpost in southern Texas, who were also heading for El Paso, where the remnants of their command group were stationed. You joined them and together you rendezvoused with the convoy at the entrance to the only passable road through the Apache Mountains. A fierce battle was raging along this pass between the Mavericks and a clan of Mexicans who had crossed the border in search of food and supplies. The convoy was forced to run the gauntlet of their gunfire before finally reaching its goal. Upon entering the city, you received a warm welcome from the WDL command group who were defending the military reserve of Fort Bliss. They celebrated your arrival for several days until the appearance of Mad Dog Michigan and an army of clansmen numbering over 1000 strong brought an abrupt end to the festivities. He had persuaded the Mexicans to join with the Lions, the Mavericks and the Saints, all of whom were now united to his cause. The situation was desperate. Faced with overwhelming odds, the WDL command tried to negotiate with Mad Dog but he rejected their overtures with disdain. He sent a reply to the command leader, Captain Frankland, in which he reaffirmed his vow to avenge his brother's death. His aims were brutally simple: he promised that neither you nor any of the colony would ever leave EL Paso alive. He set up headquarters in Ciudad Juarez, on the Mexican side of the Rio Grande, where he directed his clan army to encircle and lay siege to the colony.</p>
    <p>For two weeks, he launched repeated attacks, calculated to weaken your defences. The colony withstood the assaults, but the constant attrition began to erode your hopes of ever being able to break out of El Paso and reach Tucson in one piece. Then a radio message was intercepted that was to turn this desperate situation into a crisis. A clan convoy of trucks was bound for Mad Dog's headquarters in Ciudad Juarez. On board were enough high explosives to blow Fort Bliss, and everyone in it, to sightless atoms. Something had to be done to prevent Mad Dog from using these explosives. Out of desperation was born a daring plan. The explosives had to be destroyed as soon as they reached Ciudad Juarez. It was a dangerous and potentially suicidal mission, too difficult for one man alone, therefore Captain Frankland chose to lead the mission himself and he called for three volunteers to accompany him. Two WDL soldiers, Haskell and Knott, readily accepted the challenge and, mindful that the future of the colony was dependent on the success of this mission, you summoned up enough courage to volunteer as the fourth member of his team.</p>

    <p>Armed with contact mines, the four of you infiltrated Mad Dog's base and blew up the explosives shortly after they arrived there. The unexpected destruction of the base threw his clan army into confusion and enabled the colony to break out of Fort Bliss virtually unopposed. As the colony made their escape westwards towards Tucson, your team escaped from Ciudad Juarez in a hijacked truck and made its way along the Mexican border. The plan was for you to rendezvous with the colony the following day, but mechanical breakdowns and skirmishes with Mad Dog's scouts prevented an early reunion. Enraged by the sheer nerve of your attack and the damage inflicted upon his command, Mad Dog Michigan sent for Helmut Varken, the most ruthless of all his HAVOC assassins. Relentlessly Varken shadowed your team as you traversed the mountainous forests of southern Arizona and, one-by-one, he coldly murdered your comrades until only you remained.</p>
    <p>In a fateful showdown in the town of Tombstone, you faced Varken and avenged your dead companions in the yard of the town's historic courthouse. Using the deceased assassin's motorcycle, you reached Interstate 10 and followed tyre tracks that were made a day before by the convoy vehicles. They led you to the town of Benson, forty miles southeast of Tucson, where unexpectedly you met up with Kate Norton. When your team had failed to make the rendezvous, the colony had come to the reluctant conclusion that you had all perished at Ciudad Juarez. Only Kate clung to the belief that you were still alive and had persuaded the colony leaders, against their better judgment, to allow her to wait for you here.</p>
    <p>Driving your roadster, the two of you set off confidently on the final leg of your journey to Tucson.  However, your confidence was soon shattered by the sudden appearance of another roadster, an armed and armoured racing machine driven by none other than your archenemy, Mad Dog Michigan. A vicious road duel ensued as you raced towards the sanctuary of the Tucson stronghold, a battle that culminated in a high-speed collision that sent your enemy careering off the freeway at over 100 miles per hour. The last you saw of the HAVOC leader was when his roadster plummeted into a deep drainage-way called the Pantona Wash.</p>
    <p>You and Kate entered the Tucson stronghold to a hero's welcome. The colony was overjoyed, for they feared that they would never see either of you again. They were saddened to hear of the deaths of your comrades, yet all drew some comfort from the knowledge that the memory of their sacrifice would never fade. Had it not been for their bravery, the convoy would never have reached Tucson intact.</p>

   <data>
    <p>Before embarking on your adventure, you must first determine your personal characteristics and the weapons and provisions with which you are equipped. An <a idref="action">Action Chart</a> has been supplied on which to record and amend these details as the adventure unfolds.</p>
    <p>Your personal characteristics comprise two basic attributes: <typ class="attribute">CLOSE COMBAT SKILL</typ> and <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ>. To discover your initial <typ class="attribute">CLOSE COMBAT SKILL</typ>, take a pencil and, with your eyes closed, point the blunt end of it on to the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a>. If you pick a 0 it counts as zero. Add 10 to the number you have picked and write the total in the <typ class="attribute">CLOSE COMBAT SKILL</typ> section of your Action Chart (for example, if your pencil falls on the number 5 in the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a>, you have a CLOSE <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> total of 15). When you fight an enemy in hand-to-hand combat, your <typ class="attribute">CLOSE COMBAT SKILL</typ> will be measured against that of your enemy, so a high score in this section is desirable.</p>
    <p>To discover your <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> level, repeat the process, but this time add 20 to the number you have picked from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a>. Write the total in the <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> section of your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a> (for example, if your pencil falls on the number 8 on the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a>, you have a total <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> score of 28). If you are wounded in combat, or injured at any other time during your adventure you will lose <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points. If, at any time, your <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points total falls to zero, you are dead and the adventure is over. You can regain lost <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points during the course of the adventure, but your <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> level can never rise above your initial score.</p>

      <p>Your ability in each of these five individual skills is measured in skill points. You begin with 3 points per skill. Before starting the adventure, you may allocate an additional 4 skill points to your list of five Survival Skills. These 4 extra points can be used to improve one or more of your five skills. During your adventure, all five skills will be severely tested, therefore the higher the individual skill level, the better your chances of survival. You may allocate your 4 additional points entirely how you like.</p>
      <p>When you have decided where to allocate your 4 additional skill points, make a note of the totals in the Survival Skills section of your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
      <p>(If this is your first Freeway Warrior adventure, your total number of skill  points should be 19: five skills x 3 points each = 15, plus 4 additional  skill points = 19 points.)</p>

         40 rounds of 9mm calibre Pistol/Machine Pistol ammunition<br />

It contains useful first aid supplies, such as dressings, antiseptics, antibiotics, water purification tablets, sulphonamides, pain killers, potassium iodide tablets (to delay absorption of radioactivity) and sutures.</p>
        <p>For convenience, these medical supplies are grouped into units. To find how many units you have in your Medi-kit, pick a number from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> (0 equals 10) and add 2.

        <p>Unless you are carrying over weapons from a previous Freeway Warrior book, you begin your adventure armed with only one of these weapons. Make your choice and then record the weapon you have chosen, together with its calibre and rate of fire details, in the Missile Weapons section of your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
        <p>In order to be able to use a missile weapon, you must have sufficient ammunition of the correct calibre. The following list shows the calibre of each weapon, the amount that is used every time the weapon is fired, and the number of rounds that you possess at the start of your adventure:</p>

        <p>The initial number of rounds should be noted in the Ammo Pouch section of your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>. Missile weapons cannot be used if you run out of ammunition or possess rounds of the wrong calibre. However, the opportunity may arise for you to replenish your supply of ammunition and/or discover a weapon of the correct calibre.</p>
        <p>You may carry a maximum of three missile weapons. However, for every missile weapon that you carry (excluding your initial choice), you must reduce your Stealth level by 1 point.</p>

      <title>Rules for Close Combat</title>

      <link class="next" idref="numbered" />
     </meta>

     <data>
      <p>There will be occasions when you will have to fight an enemy in hand-to-hand combat. The enemy's <typ class="attribute">CLOSE COMBAT SKILL</typ> and <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> level will both be given in the text. Your aim in close combat is to kill the enemy by reducing his <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points to zero while losing as few of your own <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points as possible.</p>
      <p>At the start of a close combat, enter both your own and your enemy's <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points in the appropriate boxes on the Close Combat Record section of your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>. The sequence for close combat is as follows:</p>
      <ol class="paragraphed">
       <li><p>Add any extra points gained through the use of close combat weapons to your current <typ class="attribute">CLOSE COMBAT SKILL</typ> total.</p></li>
       <li>
        <p>Subtract the <typ class="attribute">CLOSE COMBAT SKILL</typ> of your enemy from this total. The result is your Combat Ratio. Enter it on the <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
        <p>Example<br />Cal Phoenix (<typ class="attribute">CLOSE COMBAT SKILL</typ> 17) is attacked by a Renegade Clansman (<typ class="attribute">CLOSE COMBAT SKILL</typ> 18). He is not given the opportunity to evade close combat, but must stand and fight his adversary. Cal Phoenix is armed with a Hunting Knife, so he adds 2 points to his <typ class="attribute">CLOSE COMBAT SKILL</typ>, giving a total CLOSE COMBAT SKILL of 19.</p>
        <p>He subtracts the Renegade Clansman's <typ class="attribute">CLOSE COMBAT SKILL</typ> from his own, giving a Combat Ratio of <ch.plus/>1 (19 <ch.minus/> 18 = <ch.plus/>1). He notes this <ch.plus/>1 on his <a idref="action">Action Chart</a> as the Combat Ratio.</p>
       </li>
       <li><p>After working out your Combat Ratio, pick a number from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a>.</p></li>
       <li>
        <p>Turn to the <a idref="crtable">Close Combat Results Table</a>. Along the top of the chart are the Combat Ratio numbers. Find the number that is the same as your Combat Ratio and cross-reference it with the number that you have picked (the random numbers appear down the side of the chart). You now have the <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points lost by both Cal Phoenix and his enemy in this round of close combat. (E represents points lost by the enemy; CP represents points lost by Cal Phoenix.)</p>
        <p>Example<br />The Combat Ratio between Cal Phoenix and the Renegade Clansman has been established as <ch.plus/>1. If the number picked from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> is a 4, then the result of the first round of close combat is:
         <ul>
          <li>Cal Phoenix loses 3 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points.</li>
          <li>Renegade Clansman loses 4 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points.</li>
         </ul>
        </p>
       </li>
       <li><p>On the <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>, mark the changes in <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points to the participants in the close combat.</p></li>
       <li><p>Unless otherwise instructed, or unless you have an option to evade, start the next round of close combat.</p></li>
       <li><p>Repeat the sequence from stage 3.</p></li>
      </ol>
      <p>This procedure continues until the <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points of either the enemy or Cal Phoenix are reduced to zero, at which point the one whose score is zero is declared dead. If Cal Phoenix is dead, the adventure is over. If the enemy is dead, Cal Phoenix proceeds but with a reduced <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> point score.</p>
      <p>A <a idref="crsumary">summary of the Close Combat Rules</a> appears on the page after the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a>.</p>

       <data>
        <p>During your adventure you may be given the chance to evade close combat. If you have already engaged in a round of close combat and decide to evade, calculate the combat for that round in the usual manner. All <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points lost by the enemy as a result of that round are ignored; only Cal Phoenix may lose <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points during that round, but that is the risk of running away! You may evade combat only if the text of that particular section allows you to do so.</p>

      <p>The day after your arrival sees the withdrawal of Mad Dog Michigan's clan army from the vicinity of the Davis-Monthan air force base, stronghold of the Tucson colony. Scouts are sent to shadow the enemy and, later in the day, they return to report that the clansmen have pulled back to Nogales, a frontier town on the Mexican border. This hurried retreat reinforces the belief that Mad Dog perished when his speedster crashed into the Pantona Wash.</p>
      <p>Boosted by the arrival of your convoy, the Tucson colony now numbers over 130 men, women and children. Supplies of food and water are adequate and, with the arrival of DC1's gasolene tanker, there is more than enough fuel to get you to California. Mike Gorgas, a former district attorney who is now the appointed leader of the Tucson colony, urges the other colony leaders to make preparations to leave the stronghold and head west without delay. The clan army may have suffered a setback but, sooner or later, prompted by a lack of supplies or a desire for revenge, they are sure to leave Nogales and attack the stronghold in force.</p>
      <p>There is also the threat of an attack by the Outlaws, an exceptionally vicious clan that controls the city of Phoenix. Among their number are many criminals who have been expelled from California since 'The Day'. Their leader, Shiloh, is one such outcast. He has been exiled into the Omega Zone (the name Californians have given to the ravaged territories east of their state line), for murder, looting and other, lesser, crimes he and his gang perpetrated in Los Angeles. During the past few months he has often crossed swords with the Tucson colony, resulting in deaths on both sides.</p>
      <p>When the time comes to plan the route to California, the colony agrees that they should try at all costs to avoid contact with Shiloh's clan. Interstate 10 is the only highway out of Tucson capable of carrying the convoy at reasonable speed, yet it passes straight through the centre of Phoenix. The only alternative is to follow this highway as far as Arizona City and then switch to Interstate 8. The colony could then follow the freeway across southern Arizona to Yuma, traverse the Colorado river at this point, and continue, through the desert and mountains of south-west California, until finally reaching its goal<ch.emdash/>the city of San Diego.</p>
      <p>Much of the territory south of Phoenix is patrolled and controlled by the Outlaws. To avoid the risk of running headlong into a clan patrol, the colony appoints you, and three others, as scouts. Whilst the colonists complete their final preparations to leave the stronghold, you and the other scouts set off along Interstate 10 to check that the road ahead is clear.</p>

      <p>Ahead you see a tall observation tower that rises high above the surrounding hills. It once provided sightseers with a magnificent view of the Anza-Borrego Desert Park; now it offers the perfect location for a radio transmission, clear of the surrounding peaks.</p>
      <p>You leave the freeway and lead the convoy along an access road that is marked with signs pointing to the Desert View Tower. The electric elevator that once serviced the observation platform is beyond repair, so the powerful DC1 radio transmitter has to be carried all the way to the top up a flight of stairs. Once in position, Pop at last makes contact with Pine Valley.</p>
      <p>At first they believe that the call is an elaborate clan trick, but confidential WDL call codes are given by a handful of Tucson colonists who were league operatives before 'The Day'. When these call codes are checked and discovered to be genuine, the Pine Valley outpost receives special authorization from army control in LA to allow the convoy into Fortress California. But this permission is coupled with certain conditions. A zero hour is given. The colony must reach Pine Valley at 11.00am, exactly one hour from now, if it is to be allowed to pass through the checkpoint. The army also insists that radio silence be maintained until your arrival, for the frequency you have been using is known to the Chargers and is often monitored. Pop agrees to the terms on behalf of the colony and signs off.</p>
      <p>Excited and eager to leave, the colonists return to their vehicles for the final journey to Pine Valley. You are one of the last to leave the tower and, when you are half-way down the ladder, you suddenly hear Rickenbacker shout a warning from the platform above: 'My God! There's a clan convoy on the freeway!'</p>

      <p>Snatching the front of your T-shirt to your mouth, you manage to control the dizziness long enough to stagger away from the edge of the platform and escape from the cloud of tear gas. As your vision clears you see that you are not the only one who has been affected by the gas. On the other side of the roof, the clansmen are doubled up on the ground, coughing and retching violently. You draw a close combat weapon and move stealthily towards the group, hoping to reach the clansmen before the effects of the gas wear off. The clansman who was seated sees you approaching but, curiously, does nothing to alert his companions.</p>
      <p>You act quickly in case he has a change of heart. Rushing forward, you get your forearm around the throat of the nearest clansman and pull him up from the ground. He drops his rifle over the edge of the parapet and, as you pull him towards you, his partner picks up his gun and fires in panic. The burst of fire kills the clansman instantly, but you survive, shielded by his body. Shocked by what he has done, the clansman freezes, his watery eyes wide with disbelief as his companion slumps dead at your feet. Before he recovers his senses, you jump forward and kick the assault rifle out of his hands, sending it sailing over the parapet to join the other gun. Before it hits the ground you press home your advantage and attack.</p>

      <p>Despite the threat of pursuit by the Outlaws, the convoy covers just fourteen miles before it grinds to a halt at the outskirts of a town called Aztec. Two of the seventeen colony vehicles have broken down due to shrapnel damage sustained during the clan attack, and a further three are on the verge of doing likewise. With night closing in, and the road ahead yet to be scouted, the colony can do little more than draw itself up in a tight, protective circle and wait for dawn to arrive. You must now eat a Meal or lose 3 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points.</p> 
      <p>At first light, you, Rickenbacker, Macy and Langdon are sent to scout the freeway and search for food and water. Meanwhile, Cutter oversees the repair of the vehicles. He is aided by Avenal and Rex Tyler, who have both been completely exonerated of Mike Gorgas' murder. Cutter estimates that the repairs will take four hours, giving you enough time to check and search Aztec, Dateland and Mohawk, the next three towns along Interstate 8.</p>
      <p>Aztec has been so badly ravaged by the post-holocaust storms that you decide not to bother searching its ruins, and instead you press on to Dateland. This town has fared little better, although you do chance across a shopping precinct on the east side of the town that looks promising.

      <p>If Cutter is disappointed to hear that the freeway ahead is blocked by a landslide, he certainly does not allow it to show. 'Hell, we're jus' gonna have t' break out the brooms 'n' shovels,' he says, with typical Texan bravado, and goes off to break the news to the others.</p>
      <p>The colonists listen to Cutter, and you watch their faces grow sterner and longer. You are worried that the bad news, coming so quickly after the shock of Mike Gorgas' death, will cause the colony to disintegrate, but, to your surprise, it has completely the opposite effect. It re-focuses attention on the immediate problems and inspires them to pull together.</p> 
      <p>Within minutes the colonists are back aboard their vehicles and the convoy is ready to move out. You and Rickenbacker resume your position at the head of the line, and you lead them out of Smurr. When you reach the pass, you bring the convoy to a halt and go forward with several of the colony's elders to assess the damage. </p>
      <p>The westbound lanes are blocked by a solid wall of rock that is more than twenty feet high in places, but the eastbound highway has escaped the worst of the landslide and Cutter estimates that it could be made passable with a couple of hours' hard work.

Barlow's face contorts into a mask of hatred and he reaches, like a striking cobra, for the pistol he has tucked into his belt. However, the Tucson escorts are already moving forward to grab his arms, and swiftly they wrestle the gun from his hand. A lone voice in the crowd demands a re-trial, but it is ignored. Then another voice rings out, but this time it captures everyone's attention. It is Macy, the convoy's lookout, and he is screaming words that make your blood run cold.</p>

      <p>Without warning, two grenades explode simultaneously in the town square and the chatter of machine gun fire echoes along the empty side-streets. Screams of panic mingle with the dull booms of more explosions as the colonists rush to the vehicles to try to retrieve their weapons before it is too late. A burst of gunfire from a rooftop stitches a line of holes across the table and sends you, and the other judges, diving for cover. Suddenly everything is chaos; it's every man for himself. You grab your gun and scurry towards a garbage cart that lies overturned on the plaza. As you skid to a halt behind the cart, you find yourself face to face with Barlow, the man you have just sentenced to death. The confrontation is shocking, but it is the sight of the screwdriver that he is holding poised in his hand that really strikes terror in your heart.</p>
      <p>With a cry of pure hatred he lunges with the screwdriver and tries to drive it into your chest.</p>

      <p>Carefully you listen to Cookie's plan. He suggests that you approach the bridge on foot, using the sagebrush as cover. Once you are in position, as near to the bridge as you can get, Cookie and Rickenbacker will approach in the truck, with Cookie driving. They will stop before they reach the bridge, whereupon Cookie will jump out and attract the clansmen's attention by shouting. Once they have taken a good look at him, he will run into the scrub. Hopefully, this will be enough to provoke the Pumas into giving chase, leaving the bridge unguarded. The moment they leave the bridge, Rickenbacker will open fire on them from the truck. Your task is to prevent any of the clansmen from reaching their pick-up and using the radio.</p>
      <p>You are not sure that the plan will succeed, but you can think of no alternative. 'It's risky,' says Rickenbacker, 'but I reckon it can work, so let's give it our best shot.'</p>
      <p>A swirling nest of butterflies that have suddenly taken refuge in your stomach prevent you from answering. The best you can manage is a weak smile as you set off towards the bridge.</p>

      <p>The windows of this store are so caked with dirt that it is impossible to see inside. You imagine an Aladdin's cave full of food just waiting to be scooped off the shelves, but your hopes are dashed when you force open one of the Supermart's electric doors and gain entry.</p>
      <p>The first thing you notice is the sunlight streaming in where part of the rear wall has collapsed. Over the past year this gap has allowed foraging clansmen and packs of hungry mountain wolves to take nearly everything worth taking from the store. Only when you search the storerooms on the basement level do you find a case of canned foodstuffs that are still edible. You are pulling it down off the shelf when suddenly you discover why the clansmen and the wolves left this case untouched.</p>
      <p>Behind the case is a nesting rattlesnake. Until now it has been sleeping, but the sudden, unexpected movement of the case has awoken it and, in fear and surprise, it lashes out and attempts to sink its venomous fangs into your throat.</p>

      <p>The first you see of Ajo is a battered city-limits sign looming out of the dusty darkness. Night has now fallen, although visibility was already so poor that you hardly notice the transition from day to night.

Suddenly the fear strikes you that you may never find the Ajo hospital, and therefore the vital Atropine, in time to save Kate's life.</p>
      <p>You have no idea where the hospital is located, so you decide to try to find a town map. You bring your car around and point it at the nearest building so that the headlights illuminate a sign that is fixed to the wall. It reads:</p>

The clan biker moves as if he is going to dismount and help his confederate. Then, realizing that he is beyond help, he quickly changes his mind and makes a hasty escape from the plaza.</p>
      <p>Rickenbacker and Cutter come running across the plaza and take cover with you behind the garbage cart. You tell them how you dispatched Barlow, and how you are now absolutely convinced that he was guilty.</p>

The convoy sets off immediately for Ligurta, a town on Interstate 8 that you checked thoroughly on your return from Yuma earlier this morning. The town is still empty, so the convoy halts here. Driving the clan pick-up truck that you discovered parked behind the cinema last night, Rickenbacker, Cookie and yourself leave Ligurta to scout the tiny town of Dome.

      <p>The route Jaeger took yesterday, when he hiked from the well in the mountains to Interstate 8, followed the course of the San Christobal Wash. For him it was a difficult trail to follow on foot, and you soon discover that it is an even harder one to negotiate in a pick-up truck. The broken ground is deeply rutted and littered with boulders, and it takes more than an hour to make the fifteen-mile climb to the well.</p>
      <p>The well itself is located at the bottom of a bowl-shaped gully, shaded from the sun by two peaks of the Mohawk mountains. A pump house stands beside the bore-hole, to which is affixed a sign that reads:</p>

      <p>You park the pick-up beside the pump house and Jaeger helps you unload the containers.

      <p>You pull off the freeway and follow the service road towards a diner, the largest building in the rest-stop complex, and park your roadster as near to the entrance as possible. The diner has been vandalized by clansmen, and broken furniture and shattered glass litter its tiled floor. The strong smell of liquor wafts from the kitchen area and Rickenbacker says it warrants a closer look. He leads the way, his footfalls crunching loudly on the glass-strewn floor as he heads optimistically towards the kitchen's double doors.</p>
      <p>'I feel kinda thirsty all of a sudden,' he says, as he pushes open the doors and strides into the darkened kitchen area. You are about to reply when a bottle comes flying through the air and smashes against the wall, missing your head by inches.</p>
      <p>'What the <ch.ellips/> !' shouts your partner. He reaches for his machine pistol, but before he can unsling it from his shoulder, a dark shape leaps out from the shadows and pulls him roughly to the floor. Instinctively, you rush forward to help him, only to find yourself confronted by a drunken clansman wielding a broken bottle. He lets out a scream and a fetid gust of liquor-soaked breath assails your nostrils. You recoil in disgust and avoid being hit as viciously he stabs the bottle at your face.</p>

Swiftly he puts paid to four of them, but the fifth escapes and comes running back across the bridge in your direction. He is a hard-faced thug dressed in a patched, silver, air-con riding suit, and he is armed with a machine pistol. His muscular legs propel him effortlessly up the gradient that leads to the truck, and, the moment he sees you, he levels his gun and begins firing at you from the hip.</p>

A T-shirted clansman lies face-up on the plaza, unmoving, his chest and stomach stained bright red. A dagger is clenched in one of his pudgy hands, and an iron bar is gripped tightly in the other.</p>
      <p>'Despite what you think o' me Cal,' shouts Tyler, 'I'm no traitor. If it's a traitor you're after, then look over there.' And with that he points towards a street that borders on the plaza.

      <p>Jaeger is talking to Rickenbacker when he mentions that, only the previous day, he found a fresh-water well in the mountains, approximately fifteen miles south-east of the town of Mohawk. He offers to lead the convoy scouts to it, and assures everyone that the source is pure and uncontaminated. 'An' the best part is that the clansmen don't know about it, either,' he says, enthusiastically.</p>
      <p>The promise of fresh, clean water lifts the convoy's flagging spirits and renews their hopes of completing the long exodus to California. You set off at once and soon cover the twenty miles of open road that lead to the derelict town of Mohawk. Once there, you and Jaeger are chosen to go and find the well.

      <p>To reduce the risk of running unexpectedly into a clan patrol, you leave Interstate 10 at the first opportunity and follow the turgid waters of the Santa Cruz River north towards Arizona City. The river takes you through the heart of the town's suburban neighbourhoods, now little more than a vast, featureless sprawl of derelict homes and ruined factories. You head for Santa Vaya, the highest of the town's districts, for it is from here that you will best be able to see Macy and Langdon's signal.</p> 
      <p>It takes you the better part of two hours to discover the ideal place to set your fire. Built next to one another on a small industrial unit, you find a paint factory and a tyre dump. A fire at either of these places would be seen for miles, but fires at both, and at the same time, promises to be nothing short of spectacular.</p>
      <p>The flip of a coin decides that Rickenbacker will set fire to the tyre dump, leaving you with the task of firing the paint factory. Having parked the roadster a safe distance away, you approach the unit with gasolene cans in hand. You enter the factory through a hole in the fence and gain access to a storage warehouse filled with drums of inflammable polyurethane resins. The smell of burning rubber tells you that Rickenbacker has already set light to the dump, and prompts you to hurry as you douse the resin drums with gasolene. In your haste you inadvertently knock the barrel of your gun against a metal stair rail and cause a spark that ignites the gasolene prematurely. Within seconds, you find yourself having to run for your life.</p>

      <p>'My name's Brent Jaeger,' he says, and tentatively offers his hand in friendship. Rickenbacker hesitates, then shakes it, and at once the man seems to relax, as if a weight has been lifted from his shoulders.</p>

      <p>'For a minute there I thought you two were clansmen,' he says. 'You can't be too careful in these parts.'</p>
      <p>'Where you from?' you ask.</p>
      <p>'I've made my way up from Panama, mostly on foot. I've got the blisters to prove it, too. I was working on the canal when HAVOC pulled the plug. I was lucky, I found a safe zone in the jungle and waited there for spring to come around again. It's sure been a long time comin'. Since things have settled I've been making my way north. I'm lookin' to get back home to San Francisco.'</p>
      <p>'You're lucky you've got this far on your own,' you say.</p>
      <p>'There were three of us when we started out, but the heat and the clans did for my friends and now I'm the only one left. I'm gonna make it, if only for their sakes.'</p>
      <p>To avoid the sun, you and Rickenbacker accept Jaeger's offer to share the shade of his makeshift tent while he continues his story. 'I heard about the scene in California from some survivalists I stayed with for a while, down in Alamos. Sounds like they've gone an' turned the state into one big fortress. The army's in charge and they've got things locked down tight. They've kicked all the troublemakers out into the desert and slammed the door. In the south, I hear they've drawn up a new state line, from Pine Valley to Banning. All the old roads in and out are guarded and I hear they've got real picky 'bout who they let in.'</p>
      <p>He reaches over to a tattered denim jacket lying on the ground, and takes an equally tattered map from an inside pocket. 'I plan on going in here,' he says, pointing to a part of the map that is so worn that it has become almost illegible. 'It's a place in the mountains, north of Lake Henshaw. I figure that the army can't have enough men to patrol that area too well. If you two'd take my advice, you'd think 'bout doin' the same.'</p>
      <p>You tell Jaeger how you survived the post-holocaust years. You also tell him that you are acting as scouts for a convoy that is equally determined to reach California, only they are now so short of food and water that unless fresh supplies are found soon, few of them are likely to survive the 400 miles that separate you from the Pacific.</p>
      <p>'Man, you guys have got problems,' he says, shaking his head slowly from side to side. 'And you're headin' slap-bang into even more. Ain't you heard<ch.emdash/>Yuma is a clan base. And believe me, the guys that are holding that city are heavy-duty bad news. If you're thinkin' of crossing the Colorado River there, forget it. You'll never make it. They'll blow you off the road.'</p>
      <p>Concerned by what Jaeger has said, and anxious that he tell everything he knows about the clan base at Yuma, you ask him to return to the convoy with you. After some thought he decides that at least there is safety in numbers, and agrees to join the colony. When you get back to Dateland, Macy and Langdon are shocked to see three people squeezed into your roadster, but you soon explain Jaeger's background, and they offer to transport him in their Trans-sol, which at least has the luxury of rear passenger seats. During your absence they have managed to forage some food, which you divide between you before you return to the convoy at Aztec.</p>

      <p>You crash down on the broken roadway with your arms outstretched and your hands scrabbling to find something to cling to. An exposed steel rod falls beneath your grasp and you grab at it with bloodied fingers. Below, you hear a loud splash as your roadster crashes into the Colorado River; above, there is the rumble of falling debris. Then a shower of dust and loose stones hits your head. They graze your scalp and make you cough violently: lose 2 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points.</p>
      <p>Bravely you hang on to the corroded steel rod, praying all the while for Rickenbacker and the others to come to your aid.

      <p>With difficulty, you grasp the rope and slowly you are hoisted away from the crumbling edge. As eager hands lift you to your feet, you notice an expanding circle of ripples in the river below. They mark the final resting place of your roadster.</p>

      <p>Before leaving Red Rock, a call comes through on the transceiver in Macy and Langdon's car. It is Pop Ewell radioing to tell you that the convoy is now ready to leave Tucson. You report that the freeway is clear as far as Red Rock, and that you will continue ahead and scout Eloy, the next major town on Interstate 10.</p>
      <p>North of Red Rock, the freeway climbs towards a mountain pass called the Picacho, and the surrounding craggy peaks strike you as ideal sniper territory. Rather than run the risk of being ambushed, you decide to pull over, and signal to Macy and Langdon to do likewise. You point out the risk but they are not convinced: they have scouted this territory many times in the past few months and they feel you are being too careful. So confident are they that the pass is deserted, they volunteer to check it out on their own. Reluctantly you agree to their request.</p>

      <p>'I count six of them <ch.ellips/> and a truck,' says Rickenbacker, as he peers through the dirty windshield at the distant bridge: 'They're from Yuma,' offers Cookie. 'Puma scouts. Probably part of the group that came lookin' for me.'</p>
      <p>Carefully you assess the situation. A frontal attack on the bridge could prove costly, and the long whiplash aerial that you see fixed to the clansmen's pick-up can only mean that they are in contact with their base at Yuma. It would not take very long for their leader, Pentagon, to send reinforcements if the scouts radioed that they were under attack. The foul, black waters of the Gila River may look uninviting, but at least they are shallow and fordable, and it would be easy for you to circle around this bridge in the pick-up and cross further upstream, where you could not be seen. However, no matter how shallow the water, the convoy's buses would never make it. No, the only way the convoy is going to reach the Imperial Reservoir is by crossing here at this bridge.</p>
      <p>Rickenbacker, who has been given a transceiver by Pop Ewell, radios the convoy to inform them of the situation. At once they suspect that Cookie is trying to lead you into a trap. He denies the charge, and in order to prove his good intent, he offers to try to lure the clansmen away from the bridge.</p>

      <p>Upon hearing the verdict, the surrounding colonists utter a sound that is full of shocked disbelief. Avenal's face turns white and limply he staggers back into the arms of the Tucson escorts. A lone voice in the crowd demands a re-trial, but it is ignored.

Before you can fire again, he grapples the machine pistol from your hands, then lunges forwards to fasten his steely fingers around your throat.</p>

      <p>Rickenbacker stands guard over the roadster while you walk back along the line of convoy vehicles looking for Mike Gorgas. Eventually you see him: he is sitting on the running board of his Mack truck, issuing specific instructions for the journey ahead to a ring of convoy drivers who have gathered around his vehicle. You wait until the circle of men have received their briefing, then you approach Mike and report what has happened to your brakes.</p>
      <p>'This is real serious,' he says, casting an anxious glance at the convoy drivers as they make their way back to their vehicles. 'And it's not the first time something like this has happened.'</p>
      <p>He tells you that yesterday, shortly after you and Rickenbacker had started the fires in Arizona City, there was an incident aboard the Amcorp Landcruiser<ch.emdash/>the convoy's largest passenger vehicle. A signal flare went off as the convoy reached the intersection with Interstate 8. It had been placed among some luggage that was strapped to the roof.</p>
      <p>'Luckily your diversion was so effective that the flare wasn't seen by the Outlaws,' says Mike, 'but I'm beginning to smell a rat. Kate Norton goes down with food poisoning despite the fact that the food was triple-checked before we left Tucson, and now you discover that your brake cables have been cut. I think there's someone among us who doesn't want the colony to reach California. I don't know for sure who it is, but I've got my suspicions. I found this attached to the signal flare,' he says, and removes a small, soot-blackened box from his jacket. 'It's a radio detonator. It was used to set off the flare.' He slips the box back into his pocket and continues in a hushed voice. 'Keep your eyes open, Cal. Once we've put some mileage between us and the Outlaws, I'll get to the bottom of this, that's a promise, but for now, you keep what I've said to yourself, OK?' You nod in agreement and then make your way back to Rickenbacker and your roadster.</p>
      <p>During your absence your partner has replaced the damaged brake lines and replenished the fluid level. He asks you what Gorgas had to say about the fact that your brakes had been sabotaged, but you evade his question by saying that he was too busy briefing the other drivers for you to be able to speak to him. Understandably, Rickenbacker is more than a little concerned that the sabotage has gone unreported, but he decides, at least for the moment, not to take it any further.</p>
      <p>The storm clouds over Gila Bend may have dispersed, but for you they have been replaced by darker clouds of doubt and suspicion.</p>

      <p>Once the fire has been extinguished completely, you join the others in examining the charred remains for signs of what could have started the blaze. The stench of burnt food hangs heavily in the air, but it does not completely mask another smell: the oily aroma of gasolene. Nobody dares to say anything but you know that you are not alone in suspecting that this was no accidental fire.</p>
      <p>Fortunately, the blaze was extinguished before it had caused major structural damage to the Landcruiser. The vehicle is still serviceable, although repairs will be needed before it can continue. As chief mechanic, Cutter examines the vehicle and estimates that the repairs will take at least four hours to complete. With sunset little more than three hours away, it is decided that the colony will camp here in Sentinel overnight, then continue west at first light.</p>
      <p>For protection, the convoy vehicles are drawn up nose-to-tail in a wide circle that skirts around the town's main plaza. Those not involved with the repair of the Landcruiser are dispatched in groups to hunt for food, but very little is found among the dust-blown ruins of this derelict town. At dusk, after a sparse meal, the colony's senior members decide that it would be an opportune time to consider the fate of Rex Tyler. A large table and seven chairs are salvaged from a nearby furniture store, and set up in the middle of the plaza where the trial is to be conducted. A discussion is held to determine the seven colonists who would be best suited, by virtue of their fairness and objectivity, to hear Rex Tyler's case and judge whether he is guilty or innocent of the murder of Mike Gorgas.</p>
      <p>At length the names of the seven judges are determined by popular vote and the list is read aloud to the gathered colony. Pop Ewell, Cutter Jacks and Uncle Jonas are chosen from DC1, Bob Grant from Big Spring, and Alice Yardum and Patrick Ohlde from  Tucson.

The seventh judge is you.</p>

      <p>Cutter tells you and Rickenbacker to follow him to the rear of the gas tanker. There, he connects the tanker's filler hose to the fuel discharge valve, then passes the nozzle of the hose to you. Together, you and Rickenbacker unwind it to its fullest extent, then signal to Cutter to open the valve. As the gasolene starts to gush from the nozzle, you and your partner walk along the line of parked vehicles and douse them liberally with fuel. Then, when the tanker is near empty, Cutter orders everyone to clear the area.</p>
      <p>You run to join Kate. She is crouching in a hollow on the lower slopes of Round Mountain, close to the freeway. It is a good position, giving a clear view of the bridge and the railroad beneath it.

      <p>A few minutes later, you see Pete and Rex Tyler's tow truck leading the convoy into the Picacho campsite. Few have eaten since the provisions were destroyed by fire back at Sentinel, so it comes as no surprise to see the colonists rushing expectantly towards the restaurant cabin the instant their vehicles halt. For a moment you fear that you will be crushed in the stampede, but with the help of Cutter and a few of the Tucson men, the hungry crowd is held at bay and order is swiftly restored. Then Cutter and his helpers ensure that the parcels of food are distributed fairly among the hungry colonists, and everyone settles down to enjoy an impromptu feast. (Your share of the feast restores 2 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points.)</p>
      <p>While everyone is eating, Pop Ewell attempts to call up the Californian army border post at Pine Valley, but still he is unable to make a clear radio contact. Maps are consulted and it is decided that an attempt should be made to reach the town of Glamis before nightfall. It lies only twenty-five miles due west, yet the rugged peaks of the Cargo Muchaco Mountains stand defiantly in your way. Although taking the colony and its vehicles over this range would be an impossible task, the mountains are scored and divided by many gullies and dry watercourses, and there is a strong possibility that a route through to Glamis could be found. However, to scout the mountains could take days.</p>
      <p>The problem seems insoluble until Rickenbacker suggests a novel solution to the dilemma.</p>

What you discover there confirms Jaeger's story<ch.emdash/>the city is held in force. The Pumas have looted the ruins of the Yuma Marine Corps Air Station, and they possess some heavy ordnance, among which are several pieces of light artillery. Cookie says that they have the shells for these guns, and that they have all approach roads zeroed-in. To take the convoy anywhere within a three-mile radius of the city would be suicidal. However, you must get across the Colorado River if you are to reach your goal.</p>
      <p>Eager to prove his worth, Cookie offers to show you a way to avoid Yuma and cross the Colorado without getting your feet wet. Reluctantly the colony agrees to give him a chance, and allows him to be untied.</p>

      <p>Shortly after noon, the colony arrives in Eloy. With a mixture of pride and apprehension, you watch as Pecos Pete's tow truck leads the convoy of fifteen vehicles along the main street, and brings them to a halt in a line outside the entrance to the town's municipal park. Kate waves at you from a window of the DC1 school bus and quickly you leave your roadster to meet her and the other colonists.</p>
      <p>Aunt Betty-Ann offers you some excellent food, which she has prepared especially for the journey, and while you and Kate are enjoying an unexpected meal together, Mike Gorgas, leader of the Tucson contingent, climbs aboard the bus to speak with you. The colony have decided that the idea of creating a diversion to draw the Outlaws away from the freeway intersection is the best chance they have of reaching Interstate 8 intact. He wants you and Rickenbacker to set fires in the suburbs of Arizona City that are big enough to draw the clansmen away. Macy and Langdon will watch the clan encampment, and as soon as they are sure that the plan is working, they will fire a distress flare. That will be the convoy's signal to move. It will also be your signal to get out of Arizona City as fast as you can. As soon as you are away, you are to head for the town of Gila Bend and rejoin the convoy there around sunset.</p>
      <p>After your meal, you say goodbye to Kate and try to assuage her fears by promising that you will take good care of yourself. The other members of the DC1 contingent wish you good luck, including your old friend Cutter Jacks, who wishes he could come with you. He assures you that, were it not for the bullet he caught in his arm when the convoy made the Slaughter Mountain run, you would have a hard job stopping him.</p>
      <p>Having said your farewells, you return to your roadster to find Rickenbacker loading two large jerry cans into the truck. They are filled with the gasolene you will need to set the fires. You help him strap them down, then both of you climb into the roadster and set off for Arizona City.</p>

Several of the slugs penetrate a metal container full of industrial blasting powder, which is standing in the back.

Suddenly there is a brilliant flash, and a deafening roar fills your ears as the truck and its contents are blown sky high.</p>
      <p>When the dust and debris have finally settled, you drag yourself to your feet and survey the destruction. The clansman did not survive the blast: his body lies a few yards away, stiff and lifeless. Across the river you can see Rickenbacker and Cookie running towards the bridge after completing their part of the plan successfully. They are relieved to see you alive. You join them in the middle of the bridge and together you return to the pick-up to report that the way across the Gila River is now clear.</p>

However, this is the only bullet left in his pistol and he has no spare ammunition.

      <p>The longer you listen to the humming, the more uneasy you feel about what might be causing it. The sound is uncannily like the sound of an insect swarm. Once, when you were seven years old and staying at summer camp in the Los Padres National Forest, you and some friends disturbed a nest full of hornets. You can still remember the pain of being stung by those angry insects vividly: it felt as though hot rivets were being driven into your flesh. To this day, that incident has left you wary of all flying insects and, rather than take the risk of disturbing another nest, you decide to leave the store and return to Rickenbacker.</p>

      <p>You gain entry to the warehouse through an open side door. The lock that once secured this steel door looks like it has been smashed with a heavy implement, probably a sledgehammer, and consequently you do not hold high hopes of finding much of value inside. Once inside, your suspicions are confirmed. The warehouse has been thoroughly ransacked, and what little of worth that could not be taken away has been smashed or befouled.</p>
      <p>After forty minutes of painstakingly sifting through the debris, you discover a case of dried soya protein wedged beneath a stack of dishwashers. The machines have fallen off a storage platform on the first floor of the warehouse, and now they form a lopsided pyramid atop the case.</p>
      <p>You are carefully extracting the precious case of food from beneath the stack of shattered machines when suddenly you hear the sound of metal scraping against metal high above your head. You look up, and to your horror, you see the white flash of a washing machine as it comes tumbling towards your face.</p>

The other biker, who is dressed in a tattered blue denim boiler-suit takes a long swig from a water canteen that is strapped to his chest. They exchange words, then together they unshoulder their machine pistols and scurry into the brush.</p>

      <p>While you are waiting for the convoy to arrive, you busy yourselves by putting out the flames that are feeding on the wreckage of the clan truck: the oily smoke could attract unwanted attention. Shortly after the fire has been extinguished, the convoy arrives and several of the colonists help with the burial of the clansmen and the removal of the smouldering wreckage to somewhere less exposed. Everyone is aware of the need for increased vigilance after your encounter with the Puma bridge patrol. Sooner or later the Yuma clan base will notice their disappearance and send more scouts to investigate.</p>
      <p>Once the clean-up is complete, Cookie is transferred to the Landcruiser and you take delivery of your roadster from Rex Tyler, who has driven it the short distance from Ligurta. Then, with your partner, Rickenbacker, you take up your familiar position at the front of the convoy and head off along the dirt road. Soon you reach the firmer surface of Highway 95 and follow it north, across a flat and featureless desert that was once the Yuma Proving Ground. A sign appears in the distance, just a dot on the horizon at first, but gradually growing larger until you can make out the directions painted on its sun-blistered surface:</p>
      <signpost>LAGUNA <ch.amp/> IMPERIAL RESERVOIRS 7 MILES</signpost>
      <p>You follow the sign, taking the smaller road that branches away to the west. The name 'Laguna' stirs memories of your childhood before 'The Day', for it was at Laguna Beach, California, that you were born and raised. You are still thinking about your old home, wondering if it is still the same, when the reservoir and dam appear in the distance. The two features make an impressive sight, enhanced by the rugged backdrop of the Cargo Muchacho Mountains and the knowledge that the land on the other side of the reservoir is California state territory.</p>
      <p>You bring the convoy to a halt at a point overlooking the wide service road that runs across the top of the dam. Cutter goes forward to check its cracked surface and after walking its entire length, returns to declare that it is passable.</p>

      <p>On your return to Aztec, you find that Gutter's crew of mechanics have repaired the damaged vehicles and that the convoy is ready to leave. The appearance of a new face causes a stir, especially when the news breaks that Yuma is a clan base. Jaeger is questioned at length and reveals one piece of information that is of special interest to Pop Ewell. He knows the exact radio frequency used by the Californians at their Pine Valley outpost. Pop tries to make contact with them, but the signal is too weak to make any sense of their reply.</p>
      <p>As you are handing over the food that was found during your scouting mission, Cutter voices the colony's fears about what has become your most pressing problem<ch.emdash/>water. In the fierce, daytime heat, there are many, especially the children and the wounded, who have already begun to suffer severe dehydration. During your absence, a small group led by Avenal was sent to the Gila River to try to fill the spare water containers. However, they found what little there remained of the river water was so polluted that not even a ten-fold dosage of purification tablets could neutralize all the toxins. One Tucson colonist, crazy with thirst, drank some and died an agonized death.</p>
      <p>Cutter and the other convoy leaders are gravely worried. Morale within the colony is at an all-time low, and unless a new water supply is found quickly, discipline is likely to collapse with disastrous consequences. It comes, therefore, as a welcome surprise when Jaeger provides, quite off-handedly, a solution to the problem.</p>

The convoy halts for a few minutes to allow him to go back and plant some grenades beneath one of the remaining outcrops. He sets the timers, allowing himself enough time to return to the convoy.</p>
      <p>Patiently you wait for the grenades to detonate. When they explode, they bring down a mass of rock that seals off the pass behind the convoy.</p>
      <p>'That should delay the Outlaws for a while,' he says, and almost cheerfully returns to take his place behind the wheel of DC1's school bus.</p>
      <p>It is mid-afternoon by the time you lead the convoy into the ruins of Sentinel. The town is deserted, and you are about to drive through without stopping when you see something in your rear-view mirror that makes you slam on the brakes. Fire is billowing out of the Landcruiser's luggage store, which is situated directly beneath the floor of the passenger compartment and adjacent to the fuel tanks. The driver and the passengers seem unaware of the danger they are in<ch.emdash/>until you bring the convoy to a halt and run back to warn them.</p>
      <p>'Fire!' you shout, as you race along the line of vehicles towards the stricken bus. Suddenly the colonists aboard the Landcruiser realize what is wrong and frantically they leap out of the burning vehicle, through windows and doors, to avoid the rising flames.</p>

      <p>As you approach the crumpled bodies, you hear the growl of a powerful car engine and turn to see the grey Trans-sol approaching from the freeway exit. You wave to show Macy and Langdon that you are both OK, and they return a thumbs-up as they halt outside the bank.</p>
      <p>'These jokers were clan members, but how do we know they're Shiloh's men?' you ask, pointing at the lifeless bodies.</p>
      <p>'They're Outlaws all right,' says Macy, motioning to the clanmen's car. 'That skull-'n'-crossbones scrawled on the driver's door is their mark, sure 'nough.'</p>
      <p>While the others dispose of the bodies, you take the opportunity to search the drugstore. You are curious to know what it was that the clansmen were looking for, and it does not take long to find out. A large cardboard container lies on its side near the door, dropped there no doubt when you and Rickenbacker made your unexpected appearance. Spilled out across the floor are bottles of pain killers and stimulants, and syringes that the clansmen have looted from the drugstore's safe.</p>
      <p>You sift through the contents and quickly scan the store's shelves for useful items. Your search uncovers enough medical supplies for four Medi-kit units. When you return to the others, they offer you the remainder of the items that were found on the clansmen's bodies:</p>

      <p>Avenal turns and fires a snap shot at Barlow's fleeing form. Unfortunately, there is only one bullet left in his pistol and it misses by a wide mark. You watch as the traitor reaches the waiting clan biker, climbs nimbly astride the pillion and is whisked away along a side street bordering the plaza.</p>
      <p>As the traitor and his confederate disappear, Rickenbacker and Cutter come running across the plaza and take cover with you and Avenal behind the garbage cart. Quickly you tell them that Barlow has escaped and that you are now absolutely convinced that he was guilty. Understandably, this remark provokes a less than charitable reaction from Avenal.</p>
      <p>'You're right,' says Cutter. 'He must have been a clan infiltrator. I'd hazard a guess that this whole attack was staged t' get him out o' here.'</p>
      <p>From behind the metal lip of the garbage cart you survey the battle that is raging around the plaza. Most of the colonists have now armed themselves and taken cover, and they are putting up a worthy defence of the vehicles. The few clansmen you do see are either dead or attempting to escape from the town now that they have achieved their objective. All of them, that is, apart from one. He is a blond-haired thug, dressed in a studded leather vest and striped pants, who is busy hammering at the glass door panels of the DC1 school bus with the stock of his machine pistol.

      <p>Few words are exchanged as Rickenbacker, Kate, yourself and six Tucson men climb into your pick-up truck and follow behind the gas tanker as it leaves the Desert View Tower. Three other vehicles follow you in line, each with its compliment of stern-faced defenders pledged to holding off Mad Dog Michigan for as long as it takes the convoy to reach Pine Valley. You sense that, like you, the others are trying hard not to think about the outcome of losing the impending battle, for deep down they know that, at best, only a few of you can expect to survive.</p>

The tanker starts to brake, then it turns towards the gap in the central crash barriers where Cutter brings it shuddering to a halt.

      <p>Watched by the surrounding circle of colonists, you approach the table and take a seat among your six fellow judges. A hush descends on the plaza as Pop Ewell calls for Rex Tyler to be brought forward to answer to the charge of murder. Flanked by two burly Tucson men, Rex enters the square, his head bowed and his hands tied before him. They escort him to a place in front of the table, where they untie his hands. Both men are armed with pistols, and they make it perfectly clear to Rex that they are prepared to use them if he is foolish enough to try to escape.</p>

      <p>Rex is questioned at length by all the judges, including yourself, and earnestly pleads his innocence. He says that his knife, the weapon used to kill Mike Gorgas, went missing the previous evening. Your fellow judges phrase their questions cleverly in the hope of tripping Rex and finding a hole in his story, but steadfastly he holds to his statement that his knife went missing and that he happened upon Gorgas' body by chance. When your turn to question him comes around for the final time, you decide to try a different tack. You ask him if he saw anyone in the immediate vicinity of the truck prior to discovering Mike Gorgas' body. After much thought he says that he remembers seeing two men, both Tucson colonists. He does not know them by name, but when asked to pick them out, he scans the surrounding faces and points to John Barlow and Paul Avenal.</p>
      <p>After consulting with your fellow judges, they agree to let you question these two men, who are both made to approach the table. You ask each of them in turn if he killed Mike Gorgas. Both strenuously deny having had anything to do with Gorgas' murder. Avenal is so outraged by the proceedings that he accuses you of murdering Gorgas, and charges you with attempting to frame him. It is not until Cutter points out that you and Rickenbacker were scouting the pass at the time of Gorgas' murder that he ceases his ranting and quietly fumes.</p>
      <p>Your second request takes both men by surprise. You ask them to step forward and empty the contents of their pockets and packs on to the judges' table. After a moment's hesitation, the two men comply.</p>
      <p>Avenal's pockets consist of the following items:</p>
      <ul>
       <li>Knife</li>
       <li>Cigarette Lighter</li>
       <li>Tin containing three cigarettes</li>
       <li>Pistol</li>

       <li>Solar Torch</li>
       <li>Map of Arizona</li>
       <li>Bottle of painkillers</li>

      <p>Barlow's pockets comprise the following items:</p>
      <ul>
       <li>Tool Kit</li>
       <li>Radio Transmitter</li>
       <li>Pistol</li>

       <li>Wire Cutters</li>
       <li>Signal Flare</li>
       <li>Reel of cloth tape</li>
      </ul>
      <p>After you have examined the items, the two men are allowed to retrieve them while you and the other judges pause to consider your verdict.</p>
      <p>After a short deliberation, your fellow judges pronounce their judgements. Two find Paul Avenal guilty of the murder; two find John Barlow guilty; and two find Rex Tyler guilty as charged. As only a majority of one vote is required, the deciding vote rests with you.</p>

There, standing in the back, is a keg filled with blasting powder. The clansman believes you are a rival clan who are out to steal this explosive, and rather than allow it to fall into your hands, he pulls the self-igniting fuse that is attached to its cap. Less than a minute later, the fuse runs out and the powder explodes, with devastating effect. There is a shuddering boom, then the truck erupts into a blazing fireball of orange and scarlet flame.</p>

      <p>Mad Dog frees his saw and launches a wild, sweeping slice at your head. You avoid instant decapitation by rolling across the debris-strewn floor, but as you rise to your feet, a wave of dizziness robs you momentarily of your sight, and you stumble backwards against the wall. Then your vision clears, and, as Mad Dog approaches, you duck below his wild sweeps and thrust the' muzzle of your empty machine pistol at his chest. You draw first blood. The clan leader squeals like a stuck pig and pulls away, but quickly he recovers and attacks you like a man possessed.</p>

      <p>It is an hour after dawn when the fortified gates of the Davis-Monthan base are unlocked and dragged open. With a reassuring smile, you bid farewell to Kate, then accelerate the roadster out of the base along the pot-holed asphalt of a service road that leads to Interstate 10. Beside you sits Gary Rickenbacker, an ex-flying circus stunt pilot from Midland, Texas. He is one of the Big Spring colonists who joined up with DC1 when your convoy reached that town, the first of the few civilized strongholds you have visited on your journey west. In your driving mirror you see Macy and Langdon, both from Tucson. They are the other half of your scouting party. They drive a supercharged Trans-sol that is sheathed in grey armour-plate, a custom modification that has saved their skins on more than one occasion.</p>
      <p>You hit the freeway doing sixty-five and follow the blistered road signs pointing north to Casa Grande. Thirty minutes later you pass through the fire-blackened ruins of Rillito and Marana, two towns the Outlaws torched last month to show the Tucson colony what Shiloh had in store for them.</p>
      <p>Ten miles slip by before you reach the next town Red Rock. There you see something unusual, which makes you ease your foot off the gas and bring your roadster gliding gently to a halt. Macy and Langdon pull up behind you, leap out of their car and run forward to find out what is wrong.</p> 
      <p>'Check out the wreck over there on the road,' you say, pointing to a car parked outside a derelict drugstore.</p>
      <p>'What d'you think?'</p>
      <p>'That sure weren't there the last time I drove through this place,' answers Macy, squinting at the distant vehicle. 'An' that was jus' the day before yesterday.'</p>
      <p>'If there's Outlaws in that town, we're gonna have to flush 'em out. If they get word back to Shiloh about the convoy, we'll have his entire gang come down on us like a ton o' bricks,' says Langdon, as he unbuckles the holster-flap covering his pistol.</p>
      <p>You agree with him and propose a plan. Two of you will enter the town and search the buildings in the area near where the car is parked. They will flush out any Outlaws that may be hiding there. Meanwhile, the other two will skirt around the town and wait on the far side at the freeway exit. If the Outlaws attempt a getaway, they will prevent their escape.</p>

      <p>The route Jaeger took yesterday, when he hiked from the well in the mountains to Interstate 8, followed the dry watercourse of the San Christobal Wash. For him it was a difficult trail to follow on foot, and you soon discover that it is even harder to negotiate in a pick-up truck. The broken ground is deeply rutted and littered with boulders, and progress is painfully slow.</p>
      <p>Rather than continue in this direction, you decide to try a more indirect route that takes you west, away from the Wash, across an expanse of desert. By chance you happen upon the remains of a dirt road that winds southwards into the mountains. You stay with this track and, although its surface is far from perfect, you make good time.</p>
      <p>At length you reach a ridge that overlooks the well. The site itself is located at the bottom of a bowl-shaped gully, shaded from the sun by two of the Mohawk's highest peaks. A pump house stands beside the bore-hole, to which is affixed a sign that reads:</p>

      <p>Carefully you descend, following the dirt road as it zig-zags towards the site. You are within a few hundred yards of your destination when you are faced by an unexpected hazard. You take a sharp right bend to find that a section of the road beyond has collapsed. You brake, but the wheels skid on the loose stones and the rear of the truck starts to slide out towards the edge. Frantically you fight to correct the skid as the truck slides nearer and nearer to the edge of the steep ravine.</p>

The seated clansman sees you approaching but, curiously, he does nothing to alert his wounded companion.</p>

He looks like he has the upper hand until a blow to the side of his head sends him reeling to the ground. The Outlaw cackles and reaches for a knife sheathed at his belt, but Rickenbacker is too quick for him. He draws the blade he carries concealed in his boot, and hurls it backhandedly at the grinning clansman. It  sinks hilt-deep into his chest. With a thin groan, the Outlaw throws his arms wide and drops, stiff-leggedly, to the ground.</p>

      <p>Uncle Jonas appears on the scene armed with a fire extinguisher, which he trains on the side of the blazing bus.

      <p>Although you were injured, your bravery and swift response prevented the fire from igniting the vehicle's fuel tanks. However, there was nothing that could be done to save the contents of the compartment, which included all the colony's food and the bulk of its water supply.</p>

      <p>You pull over to the side of the road and Rickenbacker radios to the convoy, instructing it to stop and stand by. Using your lenses you are able to see that behind the tents a road block has been erected. It consists of rubble and auto wrecks, and it completely blocks the highway leading to the town of Westmorland. The road south to Brawley is open, but there are several strange-looking people standing at the junction, either singly or gathered in groups. Some are dressed in brightly coloured patchwork clothes, others are half-naked, yet all of them have one thing in common: they move with such lethargy that, from a distance, they resemble a colony of shambling zombies.</p>
      <p>'I don't like the look of this,' you say to your partner. 'Radio the convoy and get them to put Cookie on. Maybe he knows something about these wierdos.'</p>
      <p>Rickenbacker complies with your request and, within a minute or so, you are talking to Cookie person-to-person. 'Sounds like you've run across a pack of Crazies,' says Cookie, after listening to your description of the people at the junction. 'They're mainly junkies and street-scum that the army kicked outta LA and San Francisco. They're usually pretty harmless, but watch y'selves. You never can tell what they'll get up to.'</p>
      <p>You thank Cookie for the advice and sign off by telling the convoy that you and Rickenbacker are on your way back. You are about to reach for the ignition when suddenly you hear movement away to your right. You turn your head and see three Crazies<ch.emdash/>two men and a woman<ch.emdash/>emerge from the scrub and scurry towards the truck. Despite their frightening appearance, you notice that none of them appears to be armed.</p>

      <p>The colony refuses to trust Cookie, and they will not allow you to risk his betraying the convoy's presence in the area. They tell you to retie his hands and deal with the clan patrol as best you can. Rickenbacker tries to argue but he cannot make them change their minds. Before they sign off, they tell you to maintain radio silence until the bridge is clear, just in case the clansmen are monitoring the frequencies.</p>

      <p>You wake late the following morning and open your eyes to the unexpected sight of sunlight streaming in through the window of your room. During the night the dust storm has abated steadily, and now, two hours before noon, the sun once again reigns supreme in the azure skies above Gila Bend. Your first thoughts are of Kate and immediately they spur you into action. Hurriedly you gather up your equipment and run all the way to the school bus.</p>
      <p>You enter to find Kate sipping soup from a spoon that Aunt Betty-Ann is holding to her lips. She still looks pale, but at least she is no longer at death's door. When she sees you she smiles and holds out her hand.</p>
      <p>'How ya doin', kiddo?' you say, light-heartedly, and squeeze her fingers, which are cold to the touch.</p>
      <p>'Better <ch.ellips/> thanks to you,' she replies. You talk to her while she drinks the last of the soup. Then your aunt goes to the front of the bus and returns with another bowl.</p>
      <p>'Here you go, Cal,' she says, 'have some brunch.'</p>
      <p>'Not mushrooms, I hope,' you comment, which makes Kate smile.</p>
      <p>As you are finishing your meal, Rickenbacker climbs aboard and informs you that the convoy will be leaving in an hour. 'We'd better get ready, Cal,' he says. 'Mike Gorgas wants us to cover point. Macy and Langdon will be the convoy's rear guard.'</p>
      <p>'OK,' you reply, as you get ready to leave. You thank your aunt for the food (restore 3 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points), and then kiss Kate goodbye before returning with Rickenbacker to your roadster.</p>

      <p>Expectantly you ease open the door but something makes you stop dead in your tracks. It is a dog-like whimpering, followed by a low growl. The sound makes you uneasy, and you reach for your gun before opening the door any wider.</p>
      <p>The room beyond is dimly lit by the glow from the roadster's headlights which filters in through an open window. The light is just enough for you to make out something moving near the ground. Suddenly a howl splits the silence and the shape leaps up at your chest.</p>

      <p>Still trembling with the shock of your encounter, you step over the coyote and peer into the room, only to find that it is filled with dusty, orthopaedic apparatus.</p>

      <p>The grenade bounces in front of the truck, rolls, then comes to rest directly beneath its fuel tank. A few seconds pass, then there is a huge bang, followed almost immediately by a huge ball of orange flame. A searing wave of heat knocks you flat on your back and leaves you gasping for air: lose 1 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> point.</p>
      <p>In the rear of the truck was loaded a keg of blasting powder, and this, coupled with the vehicle's gasolene, has produced a spectacularly devastating explosion.</p>
      <p>The noise alerts the other clansmen and suddenly all hell breaks loose. They leap to their feet and come running across the bridge, cursing and fumbling for their weapons as they do so. Through a pall of falling dust you hobble to where Rickenbacker is hiding and lower yourself into the ditch beside him.</p>
      <p>'What the heck was that?' he gasps, stunned by the unexpected force of the explosion.</p>
      <p>'They must have had some explosives on board,' you reply. 'I think it's safe to say the radio's been destroyed!'</p>
      <p>As the dust clears slowly, you see the clansmen running towards the blazing remains of their truck. As they get nearer, you take up your gun and prepare to open fire.</p>

A leather-jacketed clansman lies face-up on the plaza, unmoving, his chest and stomach stained bright red. A bowie knife is clenched in one of his bony hands, and a grenade, its pin undrawn, is gripped tightly in the other.</p>
      <p>'Despite what you think o' me, Phoenix,' shouts Avenal, 'I ain't no traitor. There's your traitor.' He points towards the street bordering the plaza. There you see John Barlow running half-crouched towards a clan scout who is sitting astride a motorcycle.</p>

      <p>Stunned and deafened by the unexpected explosion, you drag yourself upright into a sitting position in time to see, through the acrid smoke, a figure approaching the open doorway. Blindly you feel for your gun but it is nowhere to hand. Then the high-pitched sound of a small engine pierces the incessant ringing in your ears, at once setting your nerves on edge.</p>
      <p>You reach for a close combat weapon as the figure steps into the lodge, and your blood runs cold when the maniacal features of Mad Dog Michigan swim into focus before your eyes. His crash into the Pantona Wash has cost him dearly. His face is a criss-cross of livid scars, many of them swollen around the stitches that are keeping the torn flesh together. He has lost his left hand, and one eye is hidden behind a patch of black cotton. It serves a practical purpose, hiding a now-empty socket, yet it also exaggerates the expression of hate and vengeance that fixes the clan leader's mouth.</p>
      <p>'Revenge is mine at last<ch.emdash/>Phoenix!' he spits, and raises the motorized chainsaw that he grasps in his right hand. The motor screams as he slashes wildly at the air, then he brings the buzzing, toothed blade down upon a table top and its surface explodes into splinters and dust. He laughs a madman's laugh as he steps slowly nearer to where you sit. With a final howl of glee, he raises the saw and screams, 'Now you die!'</p>

Night has now fallen, although visibility has been so poor that you hardly notice the transition from day to night.

      <p>Through the shimmering heat haze you see the first vehicle in the clan convoy roll to a halt about 200 yards from the blazing barricade. The others stop in line behind it and a swarm of leather-clad clansmen disembark and scurry for cover among the rocks on either side of the freeway. You glance at Kate and force a smile as you slip off your gun's safety catch and prepare to meet their advance.</p>

      <p>Then you hear the distant popping of gunfire, and bullets start to whistle and buzz above your head like angry insects. To your right, a group of fellow defenders open fire at a pair of clansmen who have broken cover less than 100 yards away. They are trying to descend the embankment to the railroad track. Bullets kick up the dust all around them but, miraculously, neither is hit.</p>

Soon you reach a place with the ominous name of Devil's Canyon, where the east and west lanes of the freeway part company in order to bypass a ridge of high ground. This ridge marks the start of a gradual climb towards the Tecate Divide and the mountains of southern California, which have been instrumental in sparing the Pacific coastal territories from the worst of the post-holocaust storms that have devastated the country's mid-western and eastern states.</p>
      <p>You are mindful that Pop Ewell is eager to contact the Pine Valley checkpoint and, as you emerge from Devil's Canyon, you see a place that looks like the ideal location for him to transmit his radio message.</p>

As has become standard practice, you drive two miles ahead of the colony and report back to them regularly by radio.

      <p>The two Outlaws continue to ride towards the bridge, and come to within 100 yards of your position before bringing their machines to a halt. One of them, a thin-limbed punk with a shaven head, kneels down to examine something on the ground. Then he stands, takes up a pair of binoculars slung around his neck, and focuses them on the bridge itself. The other biker, who is dressed in a tattered blue denim boiler-suit, takes a long swig from a water canteen that is strapped to his chest.</p>
      <p>'Shall we take 'em out?' whispers Rickenbacker.</p>
      <p>You are about to reply when the shaven-headed clansman stiffens. He lets his binoculars fall and snatches up the machine-pistol that is slung beneath his shoulder. Somehow, by sound or instinct, he has been alerted to your position. He shouts a warning to his partner and they scurry into the surrounding brush before you have a chance to fire.</p>
      <p>'They know we're here,' hisses Rickenbacker. 'I don't like it.'</p>

      <p>With your nerves on edge you scour the surrounding undergrowth. A sudden noise to your left, like that of a falling stone hitting the ground, makes you turn your head, but a quieter shuffling noise to your right causes you to turn back just in time to see the shaven-headed clansman running towards you with a knife in his hand. He makes a dive and is upon you before you can fire a shot. Instinctively you grab his wrist and manage to twist the blade from his hand, but tenaciously he fights back, kicking and clawing like a wild animal as he launches his fight to the finish.</p>

A five-mile detour takes you across the Gila River and enables you to approach the clansmen from the north, the direction in which they would be least expecting an attack.

There you discover a store of foodstuffs, a secret hoard that the clansman had been keeping from his fellow clan members.</p>
      <p>'The colony sure are gonna appreciate this,' says Rickenbacker, as he reaches for his radio transceiver.

Thousands of cockroaches cover every surface in the store room, seething and undulating like some grotesque living carpet.

      <p>'By the majority decision of this tribunal, we find Rex Tyler guilty of the murder of Michael Gorges in the first degree. This crime is a capital offence, punishable by death by firing squad. The sentence is to be carried out immediately.'</p>

A lone voice in the crowd demands a re-trial, but it is ignored. Then another voice rings out, but this time it captures everyone's attention. It is Macy, the convoy's lookout, and he is screaming words that make the blood run cold.</p>

      <p>'We found this guy camped near the San Christobal Bridge,' says Langdon, as the Trans-sol glides to a halt beside your roadster.</p>
      <p>'He says he's on his way to San Francisco, would you believe?' comments Macy, as he gets out of the car with the man in tow.</p>
      <p>'What's your name?' you ask.</p>
      <p>'Brent Jaeger,' he replies, and tentatively he offers his hand in friendship. At first you hesitate, then you shake it, and at once the man seems to relax, as if a weight has been lifted from his shoulders.</p> 
      <p>'For a minute there I thought you guys were clansmen,' he says. 'I thought my time was up.</p> 
      <p>'Where you from?' you ask.</p>
      <p>'I've made my way up from Panama, mostly on foot. I've got blisters to prove it, too. I was working on the canal when HAVOC pulled the plug. I guess I was lucky, I found a safe zone in the jungle and waited there for spring to come around again. It's sure been a long time comm'n.'</p>
      <p>'Amen,' replies Langdon.</p>
      <p>'Since things have settled I've been making my way north. I'm lookin' to get back home to San Francisco.'</p>
      <p>'You're lucky you've got this far on your own,' you say.</p>
      <p>'There were three of us when we started out, but the heat and the clans did for my friends and now I'm the only one left. I'm gonna make it, if only for their sakes.'</p>
      <p>Rickenbacker offers him some water from his canteen and he accepts it gladly. 'I heard about the scene in California from some survivalists I stayed with for a while down in Alamos. Sounds like they've gone an' turned the state into one big fortress. The army's in charge and they've got things locked down tight. They've kicked all the troublemakers out into the desert and slammed the door. In the south, I hear they've drawn up a new state line, from Pine Valley to Banning. All the old roads in and out are guarded and I hear they've got real picky 'bout who they let in.'</p>
      <p>He reaches to the inside pocket of his tattered denim jacket and produces an equally tattered map. 'I plan on going in here,' he says, pointing to a part of the map that is so worn that it has become almost illegible. 'It's a place in the mountains, north of Lake Henshaw. I figure that the army can't have enough men to patrol that area too well. If you guys'd take my advice, you'd think 'bout doin' the same.'</p>
      <p>You tell Jaeger your own story of how you survived the post-holocaust years. You also tell him that you and the others are acting as scouts for a colony of people who are equally determined to reach California, only they are now so short of food and water that unless fresh supplies are found Soon, few of them are likely to survive the 400 miles that still separate you from the Pacific Ocean.</p>
      <p>'Man, you guys have got problems,' he says, shaking his head slowly from side to side. 'And you're headin' slap-bang into even more. Ain't you heard<ch.emdash/>Yuma is a clan base. And believe me, the guys that are holding that city are heavy-duty bad news. If you're thinkin' of crossing the Colorado River there, forget it. You'll never make it. They'll blow you off the road.'</p>
      <p>Worried by what Jaeger has said, and eager that he tell everything he knows about the clan base at Yuma, you ask him to return to the convoy with you. After some thought, he decides that there may, after all, be safety in numbers, and he agrees to join the colony. Anxious to get back, you climb into your roadster and set off on the return road to Aztec.</p>

      <p>Shortly, you arrive at the medicine storage facility. The elation you feel at having found it so quickly is dampened when you switch on the lights and take stock of your surroundings. Tens of thousands of bottles and containers line the shelves and, to make matters worse, you soon discover that all the drugs classified as poisonous or under FDA control are locked away in a vault-like room, protected by a steel door and a sophisticated combination lock. It could take you a week to search the shelves, and considerably longer to force open the vault door.</p>
      <p>Hoping to get lucky, you search through the store's card index system, looking for the Atropine listing. You find it, but your worse fears are confirmed when you see that the stock records are printed on a red card. Atropine is classified as a poison and is therefore kept locked away inside the vault.</p>
      <p>With dread, you examine the combination lock. It is an electronic device, consisting of three groups of three numbers, each group arranged in the shape of an 'L'. One of the numbers in the last group is missing. When the correct number is tapped in here, it completes the sequence and releases the lock. Consider the following numbers carefully. When you think you know the missing number, turn to the entry that bears the same number as your answer.</p>

      <p>You pull over to the side of the road and Rickenbacker radios to the convoy, instructing it to stop and stand by. You focus your eyes on the distant junction, and begin to make out the shape of people. They are standing on the highway, either singly or in groups, but they do not appear to be doing anything in particular. When they do move it is with such lethargy that, from this distance, they resemble a colony of shambling zombies.</p>
      <p>'I don't like the look of this,' you say to your partner. 'Radio the convoy and get them to put Cookie on. Maybe he knows something about these wierdos.'</p>
      <p>Rickenbacker complies with your request and, within a minute or so, you are talking to Cookie person-to-person. 'Sounds like you've run across a pack of Crazies,' says Cookie, after listening to your description of the people at the junction. 'They're mainly junkies and street-scum that the army have kicked outta LA and San Francisco. They're usually pretty harmless, but watch y'selves. You never can tell what Crazies'll get up to.'</p>
      <p>You thank Cookie for the advice and sign off by telling the convoy that you and Rickenbacker are on your way back. You are about to reach for the ignition when you hear a movement away to your right. You turn your head and see three Crazies<ch.emdash/>two men and a woman<ch.emdash/>emerge from the scrub and scurry towards the truck.

      <p>You need to follow the course of the Santa Rosa Wash for only half a mile before you find an ideal place to cross. It is close to the town of Cucklebur, a settlement that was home to the Papago Indians before 'The Day'. As you drive through the town, the beginnings of a hot, north-westerly wind sweeps across the land, and you notice a dark storm cloud streaking the sky. You pray that it is the prelude to a rainstorm, for it has not rained in these parts for more than a year, but your experience and your senses tell you otherwise.</p>
      <p>'There's a dust storm brewin', dare say it's blowin' down from the Nevada desert,' you say, motioning to the north.</p>
      <p>'Looks like it could be a mean 'un,' replies Rickenbacker, as he stares thoughtfully at the gathering cloud. 'A real mean 'un.'</p>
      <p>By the time you rejoin Interstate 8, the weather has greatly deteriorated. Carried on a high wind come swirling, stinging eddies of rust-red sand, some as tall as five-storey buildings. They move across the landscape like spinning tops, sucking in and spewing out tons of dust, rock and debris every second of their short but violent lives. So great has the dust saturation become that even though it is still only late afternoon, you are forced to switch on your headlights in order to make out the road ahead.</p>
      <p>Out of this wall of dust a mileage sign appears, which says:</p>
      <signpost>GILA BEND<ch.emdash/>44 miles</signpost>
      <p>It is nearly an hour before you see another sign. This one announces a rest stop one mile ahead on the freeway.</p>

      <p>The first of the convoy vehicles draws up as you and your captive arrive back at the roadster. Rickenbacker notices the cords binding the clansman's hands and comments on your thoroughness.</p>
      <p>'Neat job you did there, Cal.'</p>
      <p>'Not really. He was already trussed-up like that when I found him,' you reply.</p>
      <p>Then Cutter and a handful of colonists disembark and come over to take a look at your prisoner. Readily he answers their questions, and seems genuinely eager to appease them. You discover that his name is Cookie. He says that he was trying to escape from Yuma and that the other two men, who ambushed you from the roof of the cinema, were scouts from a clan called the Pumas who control that city. Cookie says he was running east in the hope of finding a colony to join. The scouts were sent to capture him and take him back to Yuma where the Pumas' leader, whose name is Pentagon, intended to execute him. It was to serve as a warning to the other members of his clan.</p>
      <p>'If you're so keen to get away from the Pumas,' says Rickenbacker, 'why the hell did you join with 'em in the first place?'</p>
      <p>Cookie says that he was exiled from California four months ago, after being caught by an army patrol while he was looting food from a derelict store in downtown LA. 'I joined the Pumas 'cause I had to. It was either that or starve to death in the desert.' He says that he knows the surrounding area well, and offers to help the colony if you agree to take him with you.</p>

      <p>Hurriedly the remaining colonists return to the convoy vehicles and begin to leave. Meanwhile, Cutter gathers about him all those who have volunteered to stay and fight. Using a map, and with minutes to spare before Mad Dog's clansmen are expected to show up, he sketches his plan of action.</p>
      <p>Cutter decides that the best place to delay the enemy is at a railroad bridge, located six miles west along Interstate 8 at a place called Round Mountain. Using the DC1 tanker, which is still laden with over 2,000 gallons of gasolene, and a handful of smaller vehicles, Cutter plans to block both freeway lanes and then set fire to the tanker, turning the road block into a blazing barricade.</p>
      <p>With the rear-guard volunteers in position on either side of the freeway, some on the slopes of Round Mountain and a few holding the high ground directly opposite, overlooking the bridge, he is confident that you will be able to hold back Mad Dog's clan long enough for the convoy to reach the safety of Pine Valley.</p>
      <p>Once everyone has been briefed, and is aware of the part they are expected to play in this desperate action, the last of the spare weapons and ammunition are distributed among you. You may choose to replenish your supply from the following:</p>
      <ul>
       <li>Pistol</li>
       <li>Rifle</li>

      <p>'Where have you been, Cal?' asks your aunt, in a tone of voice that reminds you immediately of your mother's. You reply simply by handing her the tub of Atropine tablets.</p>

      <p>Gasping for breath, you step back from Mad Dog's lifeless body and turn around to give what help you can to your friends. You are saddened to see that Langdon is beyond help: he took the full force of the blast that blew open the lodge door, and must have died instantly. For a moment you fear that all the others have suffered a similar fate, but your panic soon passes when you check them out one by one. Kate is the first to regain her feet. She has just managed to stand when she sees Mad Dog lying dead on the floor, and almost swoons. You support her and hold on to her until the dizziness passes. 'At last,' she says, looking down at the HAVOC leader's face. 'The nightmare is finally over.'</p>
      <p>'Not completely,' says Cutter, wiping away a trickle of blood from his brow. 'That's right,' interjects Rickenbacker. 'We've still got to get to Pine Valley.'</p>
      <p>Outside you find a pick-up truck. It was the vehicle Mad Dog used to reach the lodge ahead of his clansmen. Now these Detroit Lions cannot be too far away, and they have been reinforced by an additional contingent of Chargers. Quickly the four of you jump into the truck and head west, driving cross-country until you rejoin the freeway near a small town called Boulevard.</p>
      <p>During your escape, Cutter makes radio contact with Pine Valley and tells them that you are on your way. He also warns them that you have a clan army hot on your heels. 'Don't worry 'bout them,' comes the reply. 'We've got a little surprise in store for those guys. You just keep your foot down and don't stop for nothing, y'hear?'</p>
      <p>All of you are puzzled by the message, then, as you reach a high peak called Crestwood Summit, you hear the roar of a jet engine, approaching from out of the western sky. It is a fighter aircraft, and Kate is the first to see it as it skims the top of Long Valley Peak and comes screaming towards you, tracking along the line of Interstate 8.</p>
      <p>Captain Ed Hughes makes a mental note of his air speed and altitude, and realigns his F-14 Tomcat ready for a strike. His is the last serviceable fighter of the VF213 Blacklions squadron left at the Miramar Naval Air Station, and he is proud to have been the one called upon to fly this ageing but deadly combat machine on what could be its last mission. The target appears in the distance and, automatically, Hughes arms his sidewinders and locks-on his targeting computer. He is seconds away from contact. A last radio check confirms that the target is valid and, with an almost casual ease, he depresses the twin red fire buttons and sends his missiles screaming towards the line of clan vehicles. By the time they have struck and destroyed the clan column, he has already banked out of his dive and is heading west, above the Sawtooth Mountains, on a bearing that will take him back to his base at NAS Miramar<ch.emdash/>Fightertown USA.</p>

      <p>The sound of the F14's attack hits you like a clap of thunder behind the ears. There is a massive explosion, followed by a long and heavy rumble that echoes for minutes among the surrounding peaks. The suddenness and awesome power of the strike leaves all four of you stunned into open-mouthed silence, and it is not until you reach Pine Valley, and see your fellow colonists waiting expectantly beyond the fenced checkpoint, that you recover your senses fully and comprehend what has happened. You have survived the journey of a lifetime and, at last, you have reached your goal.</p>
      <p>Following your reunion with your fellow colonists, you are escorted by the army to the US Naval Hospital in San Diego, where those who require it receive expert medical attention. News of your daring journey spreads quickly, and many hundreds of San Diegans besiege the hospital for a glimpse of those who have come out of the Omega Zone, a region where no civilized man was thought capable of surviving for more than a few weeks.</p>
      <p>It is not long before the full account of the hardships and perils you have faced are coaxed out of your fellow colonists by the news-hungry Californian populace. Within a few days you discover that your personal exploits have made you quite a hero in their eyes, especially when it is revealed that you were born and raised in California. Your reputation is further glorified when the full story of your love for Kate Norton is told, and of how you saved her from the clutches of a despised HAVOC leader against all odds.</p>
      <p>The army and the civil leaders stage a special ceremony in honour of the indefatigable spirit that you and your colony displayed during your exodus. News of the ceremony comes as an unexpected surprise, yet there is an even greater surprise awaiting you. At the end of the grand ceremony, you are reunited with your family, all of whom have survived the post-holocaust years. It is a joyous and emotional reunion, the memory of which you will cherish for the rest of your life.</p>
      <p>For you, Cal Phoenix, the journey is over. You have triumphed where most would have failed, and by doing so, you have earned yourself a special place in the history of America.</p>
