THE STORY SO FAR

It is Spring in the year MS 5084 and you are a Grand Master of the New Order of the Kai, the warrior elite of Sommerlund.

Thirty-five years ago, the First Order of the Kai were massacred by the Darklords of Helgedad, a host of powerful creatures sent by the evil God Naar to destroy the world of Magnamund. Lone Wolf, the supreme leader of your illustrious fighting order, was the only survivor of their attack upon the Kai. As a young initiate he stood amid the burning wreckage of the old Kai monastery and vowed to avenge the slaughter of his comrades. Twenty-five years later he kept his pledge when alone he infiltrated the foul domain of the Darklords and destroyed the infernal city of Helgedad, the base of their evil power.

With the destruction of Helgedad, chaos befell the Darklord armies who had, until then, been poised to conquer all Magnamund. Quickly, their disorder escalated into a mutinous civil war, allowing the Free Alliance armies of Magnamund time enough to recover and launch a successful counter-offensive. Against all odds, a swift and total victory was secured over the feuding armies of evil.

Following the demise of the Darklords, peace reigned in your homeland of Sommerlund. Under the direction of Lone Wolf the ruined monastery of the Kai was rebuilt and restored to its former glory, and a New Order was established. You are one of this new generation of Kai recruits. You were born in Sommerlund in the year MS 5063, during the time of the war against the Darklords. When you were seven years old, you were sent by your father to the Kai Monastery. There, under the tutelage of Lone Wolf, you developed your martial skills and honed the special Kai abilities which lay dormant within you. Your skills were nurtured and sharpened to perfection by years of study and rigorous training. Your exceptional talents helped you to master all of the Kai and Magnakai Disciplines, and swiftly you rose through the ranks of the New Order to become one of only five who now hold the high rank of Kai Grand Master. It is an achievement that has brought great honour upon you and your family.

In the year MS 5077 your skill and courage were put to the test when an attack was launched upon the Kai Monastery during Lone Wolf<ch.apos/>s absence. By means of a Shadow Gate (an astral corridor between the physical world of Sommerlund and the many ethereal domains which lie beyond it), Naar sent forth a host of dragon-creatures to besiege the monastery and lay waste to all Sommerlund. He had chosen his time wall, yet his evil plan was thwarted by the tenacious defence that you and your fellow warriors maintained until the siege was raised by Lone Wolf and the King<ch.apos/>s Army of Sommerlund.1

During the seven years since the defeat of his minions, Naar has sought vengeance upon the Kai. He commands many agents of evil upon Magnamund, and they wait quietly in the shadows for the chance to serve their fell master.

You have recently returned to the Monastery after successfully completing a dangerous mission in the Kingdom of Bor.2 The vast underground realm of Bor is home to the Drodarin dwarves, the oldest allies of the Kai. Forbidden excavations in the lowest levels of the kingdom had awoken and released the Shom<ch.apos/>zaa<ch.emdash/>a supernatural creature entombed by Magnamund<ch.apos/>s earliest magicians, the Elder Magi, during their ancient war against Naar<ch.apos/>s legendary champion: Agarash the Damned.

Lord Rimoah, speaker for the High Council of the Elder Magi, travelled with you to Bor aboard a wondrous flying ship called Cloud-dancer and, with his help, you were able to defeat the Shom<ch.apos/>zaa and save your Drodarin allies from destruction.

Three months after you returned from Bor, Lord Rimoah came to the Kai Monastery aboard Cloud-dancer. His visit was unexpected and you sensed at once that something was wrong. Lone Wolf summoned you to his chamber where, with mounting dread, you listened to Lord Rimoah<ch.apos/>s account of events in Southern Magnamund that threaten to destroy the fragile peace of that continent.

The Elder Magi had received word from King Karvas of Siyen that Autarch Sejanoz, the evil ruler of Bhanar, had secretly despatched a squad of his Imperial Guards into the Doomlands of Naaros. At first, neither the King nor the Elders could fathom a reason why the Autarch had done this. The Doomlands are one of the most inhospitable regions in all of Magnamund, a barren wasteland of ash and cinders that once was the domain of Agarash the Damned. At its centre stood his mighty fortress-city of Naaros. Yet, following his defeat by the Elder Magi, all that remains of it now is a titanic chasm of molten lava and heat-fused rock.

Fearing for the security of his southern borderlands, King Karvas sent a group of elite Siyenese rangers into the Doomlands to spy on the Autarch<ch.apos/>s men in the hope of discovering their true purpose. When, after six weeks, nothing was heard from the group, the King and his court assumed they had perished. Then a few days later, Karvas received word unexpectedly from his missing men. They had tracked the squad of the Autarch<ch.apos/>s Imperial Guard deep into the Doomlands, and they had observed them excavating an unmarked burial mound near to the ruins of Naaros. And it was here that they were to witness a chilling discovery, for buried beneath the mound lay the Claw of Naar.

The Claw of Naar is an ancient wand of power that was crafted by the evil God himself, and used by Agarash the Damned during his conquest of Magnamund. Legend held that it had been lost forever in the molten ruin of Naaros, but now it had resurfaced, and its return boded trouble for the peaceable nations bordering upon the autocracy of Bhanar.

The rangers reported that the Autarch<ch.apos/>s squad were returning to Bhanar with the Claw in their possession. Their chosen route would take them through the Southern Dammerdon mountains and so the rangers went ahead to hide themselves in Sunderer Pass where they intended to await their arrival. Their plan was to ambush the squad in the narrow confines of the pass and steal away the Claw. However, the ranger leader was fearful that the power of the Claw might overwhelm his small group. He requested of his King that help be sent urgently. Karvas responded to his plea by seeking the aid of the Elder Magi, and upon hearing of the situation, Lord Rimoah readily agreed to assist.

<quote>In turn, Lone Wolf, I have come this day to ask for the help of the Kai,</quote> said Rimoah. <quote>We of the Elder Magi have the power and the means to destroy the Claw of Naar, but only when we have that accursed object in our possession. To secure the Claw will require skills and courage that only the Kai possess. And so, I come here seeking your aid, Supreme Master.</quote>

<quote>It will not be an easy task,</quote> replied Lone Wolf, thoughtfully, <quote>but we have the advantage of both speed and surprise. Sunderer Pass is no more than a day<ch.apos/>s journey away by skyship.</quote>

<quote>Aye,</quote> replied Rimoah, <quote>but we must depart this afternoon if we are to be certain of reaching the pass before the arrival of the Autarch<ch.apos/>s squad.</quote>

Lone Wolf slowly turned to face you. <quote>I am tempted to accept this challenge myself, Grand Master,</quote> he said, as he held you with his unblinking gaze. <quote>But, alas, I must attend a War Council tomorrow at the King<ch.apos/>s Court in Holmgard. Will you journey to Bhanar in my stead and help Lord Rimoah to capture the Claw of Naar?</quote>

<quote>Yes, my Lord,</quote> you replied, without hesitation. <quote>For the greater glow of Sommerlund and the Kai, I am proud to accept this task.</quote>

THE GAME RULES

You keep a record of your adventure on the <a idref="action">Action Chart</a> that you will find in the front of this book. For ease of use, and for further adventuring, it is recommended that you photocopy these pages.

During the years you have spent in training at the Kai Monastery, you have devoted yourself to further developing your fighting prowess (<typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ>) and physical stamina (<typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ>). Before you begin this New Order adventure you need to measure how effective your training has been. To do this take a pencil and, with your eyes closed, point the blunt end of it on to the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> on the last page of the book. If you pick a 0 it counts as zero.

The first number that you pick from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> in this way represents your <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ>. Add 25 to the number you picked and write the total in the <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> section of your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a> (ie, if your pencil fell on the number 7 in the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> you would write in a <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> of 32). When you fight, your <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> will be pitted against that of your enemy. A high score in this section is therefore desirable.

The second number that you pick from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> represents your powers of <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ>. Add 30 to this number and write the total in the <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> section of your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a> (ie, if your pencil fell on the number 8 on the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a>, you would have 38 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points).

If you are wounded in combat you will lose <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points. If at any time your <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points fall to zero, you are dead and the adventure is over. Lost <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points can be regained during the course of the adventure, but your number of <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points can not rise above the number you have when you start an adventure.

If you have successfully completed previous adventures in the Lone Wolf New Order series (Books 21<ch.endash/>26), you can carry your current scores of <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> and <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points over to this adventure. You may also carry over any Special Items, Kai Weapon, normal weapons and Backpack Items you had in your possession at the end of your last adventure, and these should be entered on your new <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>.

Playing Tip: You may use a 10-sided die instead of the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> if you find it more convenient.

YOUR KAI NAME

It has long been the tradition of your elite warrior caste to bestow a new name upon each young novice when they complete their first year<ch.apos/>s training at the Kai Monastery. Kai names are chosen by senior Kai Masters with the aim of reflecting the individual strengths and qualities of each novice.

You may create your own Kai name for yourself, or you can generate a Kai name at random using, the name tables below. To generate a Kai name, pick a number from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> and consult Table A. The name which corresponds to the number you have picked is the first part, or prefix, of your Kai name. Now pick a second number from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> and consult Table B. The name which corresponds to the number you have picked is the second part, or suffix, of your Kai name. Put the prefix and the suffix together and you have your own personal Kai name. You can record your personal Kai name on the book plate which appears on the inside front cover of this book.

TABLE A TABLE B
(Kai name prefix) (Kai name suffix)
0 = Swift 0 = Blade
1 = Sun 1 = Fire
2 = True 2 = Hawk
3 = Bold 3 = Heart
4 = Moon 4 = Friend
5 = Sword 5 = Star
6 = Wise 6 = Dancer
7 = Storm 7 = Helm
8 = Rune 8 = Strider
9 = Brave 9 = Shield

NEW ORDER KAI GRAND MASTER DISCIPLINES

After years of martial training and study at the Kai Monastery, and by the rigorous practice of the teachings of your illustrious mentor<ch.emdash/>Kai Supreme Master Lone Wolf<ch.emdash/>you have achieved the noble rank of Kai Grand Master Senior.

Following in the footsteps of Lone Wolf himself, you have vowed that one day you will become totally proficient in all sixteen of the New Order Kai Grand Master Disciplines. By doing so successfully you will share with Lone Wolf the responsibility, the honour, and the future glory of leading the New Order Kai as a Supreme Master.

If this is the first New Order adventure you have undertaken, then your present rank is that of Kai Grand Master Senior. This means that you have mastered four of the New Order Grand Master Disciplines listed below. It is for you to decide which four Disciplines these are. As all of the New Order Grand Master Disciplines will be of use to you at some point during your mission, pick these four skills with care. The correct use of a New Order Grand Master Discipline at the right time could save your life. When you have chosen your four Disciplines, enter them in the Grand Master Disciplines section of your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>.

1. Grand Weaponmastery
This Discipline enables a New Order Grand Master to become supremely efficient in the use of all weapons. When you enter combat armed with one of your Grand Master weapons, you may add 5 points to your <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ>. The rank of Kai Grand Master Senior, with which you begin the New Order series, means that you are skilled in the use of one of the weapons listed in the EQUIPMENT section. For every adventure that you complete successfully in the New Order series, you will gain proficiency with one additional weapon.

2. Animal Mastery
New Order Grand Masters have considerable control over hostile, non-sentient creatures. Also, they have the ability to converse with birds and fishes, and use them as guides.

3. Deliverance (Advanced Curing)
New Order Grand Masters are able to use their healing power to repair serious battle wounds. If, while in combat, their <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> is reduced to 8 points or less, they can draw upon their mastery to restore 20 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points. This emergency ability can only be used once every 20 days.

4. Assimilance (Advanced Invisibility)
New Order Grand Masters are able to effect striking changes to their physical appearance, and maintain these changes over a period of 1 to 3 days. They have also mastered advanced camouflage techniques which make them virtually undetectable in an open landscape.

5. Grand Huntmastery
New Order Grand Masters are able to see in total darkness and they possess great natural speed and agility. They also have a superb sense of touch and taste.

6. Grand Pathsmanship
New Order Grand Masters are able to resist entrapment, by hostile plants. Also they have a super-awareness of ambush, or the threat of ambush, in woods and dense forests.

7. Kai-surge
When using their psychic ability to attack an enemy, New Order Grand Masters may add 8 points to their <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ>. For every round in which Kai-surge is used, they need only deduct 1 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> point. Grand Masters have the option of using a weaker form of psychic attack called Mindblast. When using this lesser attack, they may add 4 points to their <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> without loss of <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points (Kai-surge and Mindblast cannot be used simultaneously). New Order Grand Masters cannot use Kai-surge if their <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> score falls to 6 points or below.

8. Kai-screen
During psychic combat, New Order Grand Masters are able to construct mind fortresses capable of protecting themselves and others. The strength and capacity of these fortresses increases as a New Order Grand Master advances in rank.

9. Grand Nexus
New Order Grand Masters are able to withstand contact with harmful elements, such as flames and acids, for upwards of an hour in duration. This ability increases as a New Order Grand Master advances in rank.

10. Telegnosis (Advanced Divination)
This Discipline enables a New Order Grand Master to spirit-walk for far greater lengths of time, and with far fewer ill effects. Duration of the spirit-walk, and the protection afforded to his inanimate body, increases as a New Order Grand Master advances in rank.

11. Magi-Magic (Old Kingdom Magic)
Under the tutelage of Lone Wolf, you have been able to master the rudimentary skills of Old Kingdom battle magic. These arcane skills include the use of basic magi-magic spells, such as Shield, Power Word, and Invisible Fist. As you advance in rank, so will your knowledge and mastery of Old Kingdom magic increase.

12. Kai-alchemy (Brotherhood Magic)
Under the tutelage of Lone Wolf and Guildmaster Banedon (the leader of Sommerlund<ch.apos/>s guild of magicians), you have mastered the elementary spells of the Brotherhood of the Crystal Star. These spells include Lightning Hand, Levitation, and Mind Charm. As you advance in rank, so will your knowledge and mastery of Brotherhood magic increase.

13. Astrology
The celestial bodies which occupy the skies above Magnamund have long been known to affect the lives of its inhabitants. Mastery of this Discipline enables a New Order Grand Master to predict and shape the future by studying the relative positions of the Sun, the Moon, and the myriad planets and stars. The number and accuracy of these predictions increases as a New Order Grand Master advances in rank.

14. Herbmastery
Mastery of this New Order Discipline enables a Grand Master to identify readily any substance derived from living or growing organic material. He is aware of any secret uses to which an organic material may be put, and he is skilled in effecting the release of a substance<ch.apos/>s medicinal and/or magical properties.

15. Elementalism
This Discipline enables a New Order Grand Master to manipulate the four basic elements: Earth, Air, Fire, and Water. By drawing upon individual (or combinations of) elements that are available, he is able to detach, affix, increase, concentrate, intensify, remove or accelerate this matter to fulfil a specific purpose, eg, create a wall, hurl a rock, spray sand, remove air, intensify fire. The versatility of this Discipline increases as a New Order Grand Master advances in rank.

16. Bardsmanship
Through mastery of this Discipline, a Kai Grand Master of the New Order becomes a multi-talented performer, proficient in the use of any musical instrument. He is able to sing or chant, recite or compose tales of legend, mimic speech or dialect and stimulate a wide range of emotions among sentient creatures. The effect and power of his bardic abilities will steadily increase as he advances through the Grand Master ranks.

If you successfully complete the mission as set in Book 27 of the Lone Wolf (New Order) series, you may add a further Grand Master Discipline of your choice to your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a> in Book 28. For every Grand Master Discipline you possess, in excess of the original four Disciplines you begin with you may add 1 point to your basic <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> score and 2 points to your basic <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points score. These bonus points, together with your extra Grand Master Discipline(s), your original four Grand Master Disciplines, your Kai Weapon and any other Special Items that you have found and been able to keep during your adventures, may then be carried over and used in the next New Order adventure, which is called:

The Hunger of Sejanoz

EQUIPMENT

Before you leave the Kai Monastery and begin your quest to capture the Claw of Naar, you equip yourself with a map of Bhanar and the Chai Borderlands and a pouch of gold. To find out how much gold is in the pouch, pick a number from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> and add 20 to the number you have picked. The total equals the number of Gold Crowns inside the pouch, and you should now enter this number in the <ch.apos/>Gold Crowns<ch.apos/> section of your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>.

If you have successfully completed previous New Order adventures (Books 21<ch.endash/>26), you may add this sum to the total sum of Crowns you already possess. Fifty is the maximum number of Gold Crowns you can carry in your pouch at any time. You may also select five items from the list below, only two of which may be Weapons.

Broadsword (Weapon)

Sword (Weapon)

Quiver (Special Item) This contains six arrows; record them on your Weapons List.

Flute (Backpack Item)

Dagger (Weapon)

Axe (Weapon)

Bow (Weapon)

2 Meals (Meals) Each Meal takes up one space in your Backpack.

Rope (Backpack item)

Potion of Laumspur (Backpack Item) This potion restore 4 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points to your total when swallowed after combat. There is enough for only one dose.

List the five items that you have chosen on your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>, under the appropriate headings, and make a note of any effect that they may have to your <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points and/or <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ>.

KAI WEAPONS

Upon reaching the ultimate rank of Kai Supreme Master, Lone Wolf received as a reward from the God Kai many new skills and abilities. One of these skills was Kai Weaponcraft. Using his new-found mastery, Lone Wolf forged ten weapons of magical power in the armoury furnaces of the Kai Monastery. These magical weapons are reserved for the elite of the New Order Kai who attain the rank of Grand Master.

In recognition of your rank and achievement, you may choose your own Kai Weapon from the table below or, if you prefer, you can generate one at random. To generate a Kai Weapon, pick a number from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> and consult the first column. The magical axe, sword, or broadsword which corresponds to the number you have picked will be your own personal Kai Weapon. Record this magical weapon and its unique properties in the Kai Weapon section of the Special Items List at the front of the book.

Example
Say you choose the number 1 from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a>, your Kai Weapon will be the axe <quote>Alema</quote>.

When using this Kai Weapon in normal combat you may add +5 points to your <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ>. Each Kai Weapon has a unique property. When you use your Kai Weapon in combat against the type of enemy that matches its unique property, or use it at the optimum time or location, then you may add the higher bonus to your <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ>.

Example
If you were to use <quote>Alema</quote> in combat against an undead enemy, you could add the higher bonus of +7 to your <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ>. If you were to fight a living enemy using this weapon then the bonus to your <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> would remain at +5.

Equipment<ch.emdash/>How to use it

Weapons
The maximum number of weapons that you can carry is two. Weapons aid you in combat. If you have the Grand Master Discipline of Grand Weaponmastery and a correct weapon, it adds 5 points to your <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ>. If you find a weapon during your adventure, you may pick it up and use it.

Bows and Arrows
During your adventure there will be opportunities

KAI WEAPON TABLE
RN Weapon type Weapon Name <typ class="attribute">CS</typ> Unique Properties <typ class="attribute">CS</typ>
0 Axe <quote>Spawnsmite</quote> +5 versus reptilian enemies +6

to use a bow and arrow. If you equip yourself with this weapon, and you possess at least one arrow, you may use it when the text of a particular section allows you to do so. The bow is a useful weapon, for it enables you to hit an enemy at a distance. However, a bow cannot be used in hand-to-hand combat, therefore it is best to equip yourself also with a close-combat weapon, such as a sword or an axe.

In order to use a bow you must possess a quiver and at least one arrow. Each time the bow is used erase an arrow from your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>. A bow cannot, of course, be used if you exhaust your supply of arrows, but the opportunity may arise during your mission for you to replenish your stock of arrows.

If you have the Discipline of Grand Weaponmastery with a bow, you may add 3 points to any number you choose from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a>, when using the bow.

Backpack Items
These must be stored in your Backpack. Because space is limited, you may keep a maximum of ten articles, including Meals, in your Backpack at any one time. You may only carry one Backpack at a time. During your travels you will discover various useful items which you may decide to keep. You may exchange or discard them at any point when you are not involved in combat.

Any item that may be of use, and which can be picked up on your adventure and entered on your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>, is given either initial capitals (eg, Silver Mirror, Gold Key), or is clearly identified as a Backpack Item. Unless you are told that it is a Special Item, carry it in your Backpack.

Special Items
Special Items are not carried in the Backpack. When you discover a Special Item, you will be told how or where to carry it. The maximum number of Special Items that can be carried on any adventure is twelve.

Kai Weapon
Your Kai Weapon is a Special item and it can be carried and used in addition to two normal weapons. If you possess the Discipline of Grand Weaponmastery for a weapon type which is the same as your unique Kai Weapon, you may add the Grand Weaponmastery bonus of +5 to your <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ>. This is in addition to the bonus aimed when you use your Kai Weapon in combat.

Food
Food is carried in your Backpack. Each Meal counts as one item. You will need to eat regularly during your adventure. If you do not have any food when you are instructed to eat a Meal, you will lose 3 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points. However, if you have chosen Grand Huntmastery as one of your four Disciplines then you will not need to tick off a Meal when instructed to eat.

Potion of Laumspur
This is a healing potion that can restore 4 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points to your total when swallowed after combat. There is enough for one dose only. If you discover any other potion during the adventure, you will be informed of its effect. All potions are Backpack Items.

RULES FOR COMBAT

There will be occasions during your adventure when you will have to fight an enemy. The enemy<ch.apos/>s <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> and <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points are given in the text. Your aim in the combat is to kill the enemy by reducing his <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points to zero while losing as few <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points as possible yourself.

At the start of a combat, enter your own and the enemy<ch.apos/>s <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points in the appropriate boxes on the Combat Record section of your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>.

The sequence for combat is as follows:

1. Add any extra points gained through your Grand Master Disciplines and Special Items to your current <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> total.

2. Subtract the <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> of your enemy from this total. The result is your Combat Ratio. Enter it on the <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>.

Example
You, Grand Master (<typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> 32), are attacked in a forest be a pack of Wild Dogs (<typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> 31). You are taken by surprise and are not given the opportunity of evading their attack. You possess the Grand Master Discipline of Kai-surge to which the Wild Dogs are not immune, so you add 8 points to your <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ>. You also possess the Kai Weapon <quote>Ulnarias</quote>, so you add an additional 5 points to your <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ>. This gives you a total <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> of 45.

You now subtract the Wild Dogs<ch.apos/> <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> from your own, giving a Combat Ratio of +14 (45<ch.minus/>31=+14). +14 is noted on your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a> as the Combat Ratio.

3. When you have your Combat Ratio, pick a number from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a>.

4. Turn to the COMBAT RESULTS TABLE on the inside back cover of this book. Along the top of the chart are shown the Combat Ratio numbers. Find the number that is the same as your Combat Ratio and cross-reference it with the random number that you have picked (the random numbers appear on the side of the chart). You now have the number of <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points lost by both yourself and your enemy in this round of combat. (E represents points lost by the enemy; GM represents points lost by yourself<ch.emdash/>Grand Master)

Example
The Combat Ratio between you and the Wild Dogs has been established as +14. If the number picked from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> is 1, then the result of the first round of combat is:

You (GM) lose 3 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points (plus an additional 1 point for using Kai-surge. This loss is in addition to the loss suffered as a result of combat)
Wild Dogs lose 9 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points.

5. On the <a idref="action">Action Chart</a> mark the changes in the <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points to the participants in the combat.

6. Unless otherwise instructed, or unless you have an option to evade, the next round of combat now starts.

7. Repeat the sequence from Stage 3.

This process of combat continues until the <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points of either your enemy or yourself are reduced to zero, at which pointy the one with the zero score is declared dead. If you are declared dead, the adventure is over. If the enemy is dead, you can proceed but with your <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points reduced.

A summary of Combat Rules appears on the page after the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a>.

Evasion of combat
During your adventure you may be given the chance to evade combat. If you have already engaged in a round of combat and decide to evade, calculate the combat for that round in the usual manner. All points lost by the enemy as a result of that round are ignored, and you make your escape. Only you may lose <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points during that round (such is the risk of turning tail and running away during combat)! You may only evade if the text of the particular section allows you to do so.

LEVELS OF NEW ORDER KAI GRAND MASTERSHIP

The following table is a guide to the rank and titles you can achieve at each stage of your journey along the road to Kai Grand Mastership.

IMPROVED GRAND MASTER DISCIPLINES

As you rise through the higher levels of Kai Grand Mastery you will find that your Disciplines will steadily improve. If you are a New Order Kai who has attained the rank of Sun Lord, you will now benefit from improvements to the following Grand Master Disciplines:

Grand Weaponmastery

Sun Lords with this Discipline are able to cause the metal edge of any non-magical weapon to ignite and burn fiercely. When a weapon thus affected is used in combat, it inflicts an additional 1 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> point loss upon an enemy in every successful round of combat. This ability cannot be used with a wholly wooden weapon such as a quarterstaff.

Herbmastery

Sun Lords who possess this Discipline are able to cause living plants, eg, grasses, bushes, flowers, weeds, rushes etc, to entwine themselves around the limbs of hostile creatures, thereby hampering their free movement. Sun Lords are able to target only one creature in this way. An additional creature can be affected for every level a Grand Master rises above the rank of Sun Lord.

Assimilance

Sun Lords who possess this skill are able to cause the outline of their bodies to become blurred and indistinct. By so doing, they can greatly increase their chances of avoiding magical and/or non-magical missiles directed at them.

Grand Huntmastery

Kai Sun Lords with this skill are able to see, with acute accuracy, light in the infrared spectrum, ie, they can see the complex patterns generated by heat in near or total darkness. They can also see light in the ultraviolet spectrum.

Kai Surge

Sun Lords who possess mastery of this Discipline are able to launch a Kai Blast<ch.emdash/>a pulse of intense psychic energy which is capable of affecting both psychics active and inactive enemies. This form of psychic attack is very effective, more so than a usual Kai-surge, Psi-surge or Mindblast. It can cause an enemy to lose between 2 and 18 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points in one attack. However, use of a Kai Blast will reduce a Sun Lord<ch.apos/>s <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> POINTS total by 4. It cannot be used in conjuction with any other form of psychic attack.

Telegnosis

Sun Lords who possess this Discipline are able to alter their body weight in order to walk successfully upon different kinds of surface, eg, water, mud, lava and quicksand. Time duration and degree of surface difficulty increases as a Grand Master rises in rank.

Magi-magic

Grand Masters who have reached the rank of Sun Lord are able to use the following battle-spells of the Elder Magi:

Penetrate<ch.emdash/>This increases the penetrative energy of any arrow, or arrow-like missile, launched by a Sun Lord.

Energy Grasp<ch.emdash/>This spell enables a Sun Lord to discharge a powerful electrical force into anything he or she touches. It is similar in effect to the Brotherhood spell Lightning Hand. It differs in that it is easier to control and channel the resulting energy. It also requires the actual touching of an object or enemy to effect the spell.

Bardmanship

Kai Sun Lords with this skill are able to direct their musical abilities to disrupt the structure of inanimate breakable objects, eg, glass, ceramics, urns, flasks etc, causing them to explode violently. Any person or creature in close proximity to the destroyed object risks injury from flying fragments.

The nature of additional improvements and how they affect your existing Grand Master Disciplines will be noted in the <quote>Improved Grand Master Disciplines</quote> section of future Lone Wolf New Order books.

NEW ORDER WISDOM

Grand Master, you are about to embark upon a vital mission to deny Autarch Sejanoz the Claw of Naar, an ancient yet deadly artefact of evil. During your quest to distant Bhanar you will encounter many strong and cunning adversaries, and your mission will be fraught with danger at every turn, so remain on your guard at all times.

Some of the material items that you find will be of use to you, but others may be red herrings of no real value at all. If you discover items during your mission, be selective in what you choose to keep. Pick your initial four Grand Master Disciplines with care for a wise choice will enable anyone to complete the quest, no matter how weak their initial <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> and <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> scores may be. Completion of previous Lone Wolf adventures (Books 1<ch.endash/>26) may be advantageous, but it is not essential for the successful completion of this New Order adventure.

May the gods Kai and Ishir guide and protect you during your mission in the sinister realm of Bhanar.

For Sommerlund and the Kai!

       <p>Within the hour, you find yourself standing beside Lord Rimoah at the deck-rail of the sleek flying ship Cloud-dancer, watching the Kai Monastery melt away into the distance as the craft soars into an azure sky. The weather is fresh and clear, and you are blessed with a strong tail wind that will assist your long journey south to the land of Bhanar.</p>
       <p>Rimoah has already charted a course for Sunderer Pass, and as his young Toranese crew attend to the running of the skyship, you settle back into the plush comfort of the Captain<ch.apos/>s cabin and discuss with him the details of your mission. After a delicious supper, you retire early and rise late in order to be best prepared for the task ahead.</p>
       <p>By noon of the next day, you have already crossed the Tentarias and entered into Southern Magnamund. You spend much of the early afternoon standing at the bow rail, lost in your thoughts as an endless panoply of rolling hills and grasslands pass silently beneath Cloud-dancer<ch.apos/>s gleaming keel.</p>
       <p>When the forbidding peaks of the Darkwall Mountains are sighted on the horizon, Rimoah takes charge of the helm and steers the skyship on a south-easterly bearing to avoid them. These mountains mark the northern boundary of the Doomlands of Naaros, and Rimoah is anxious to avoid this notoriously stormy region. Skilfully he navigates a course around the eastern boundary of the Doomlands until, late in the afternoon, you see the snow-capped tips of the Southern Dammerdon Mountains soar into view.</p>
       <p>Rimoah passes the helm back to his bo<ch.apos/>sun, then he hurries to join you at the bow rail. <quote>Keep your eyes peeled, Grand Master,</quote> he says. <quote>Sunderer Pass is a narrow gorge. It<ch.apos/>ll be hard to spot from here.</quote> Aided by your ability to magnify your vision, you are the first one to see the tiny pass. Rimoah praises your keen sight and he signals to the bo<ch.apos/>sun to bring Cloud-dancer around to the southern slopes of the Dammerdons, to a place where the pass emerges from the mountain range. Here you notice a pale cross of sun-bleached boulders laid out on the dark, dusty ground. It is a sign Rimoah has been hoping for, and excitedly he calls for the bo<ch.apos/>sun to steer the skycraft towards it.</p>
       <p>Cloud-dancer is brought to hover directly above the cross. You leave the rail and accompany Rimoah into a boarding cage located at the stern, and together you are winched to the ground. As the cage touches down, you push open its iron gate and step out. Your pulse quickens when suddenly you see four shadowy figures emerging from the surrounding rocks.</p>

       <p>You make a wide detour around the encampment before continuing your ride south. It is mid-afternoon when you see a settlement in the distance, one of many that can be found on the fringes of the Yua Tzhan province. As you are passing through this ragged plains village, you see a busy market in operation. The traders and their costumers stop to stare as you ride past; their eyes drawn by the unusual cut and colour of your tunics.</p>
       <p>Gildas points to a clothes stall that is heaped with simple straw-coloured robes, much favoured by these Bhanarian plains-dwellers. <quote>Maybe a wise purchase, Sir Kai?</quote> he mutters. <quote>I fear our tunics may arouse yet more suspicion the further south we venture.</quote> You nod in agreement and halt to ask the trader how much he wants for four of his robes.</p>
       <p><quote>One hundred and fifty Ren,</quote> he replies, breezily.</p>
       <p>The trader<ch.apos/>s price is the equivalent to 15 Gold Crowns. The rangers do not have any money, so if you wish to purchase these garments you must pay the full price.</p>

       <p>Your tracking skills tell you that this hut was abandoned by its owner earlier this morning. Its log stove is still warm, and a plate of food lies untouched on the table. You share out the food and dry your clothes by the stove. Sergeant Paviz keeps watch at the window in case a patrol should come by to search the hut.</p>
       <p>As midnight approaches, the enemy activity in Zuda decreases. Gildas suggests you should leave during the night to minimize risk of discovery the darkness provides invaluable cover. You agree, and after midnight you set out for the town.</p>
       <p>Bhanarian soldiers are billeted in most of the shops and houses. You keep to the back streets to avoid the patrols, but every alley and avenue leads to the market square at the centre of the town, and you cannot avoid passing through this area. In the middle of the square a magnificent tent has been erected. High above flies a scarlet flag emblazoned with a gold tiger<ch.apos/>s head. This is Sejanoz<ch.apos/>s personal flag and it signifies that the Autarch is here in person. A dozen of his best soldiers guard his tent, and parked beside its entrance are two strange machines.</p>
       <p>The first is an elaborate shrine. It is fashioned from gold and jewels and has been crafted into the likeness of a tiger<ch.apos/>s head. Two huge ivory fangs protrude from its jaw and its jewelled eyes glow with a flickering scarlet fire.</p>
       <p>The second is a golden chariot. This vehicle has no team of horses to pull it, for it needs no animals to cause it to move. It is a sky chariot, powered by the same magical forces that enable Cloud-dancer to soar through the air.</p>
       <p>You are observing the shrine from the cover of a doorway when suddenly the head slowly rotates in your direction, and two pencil-thin beams of red light shoot from its eyes. You duck back, but it is too late<ch.emdash/>the shine has detected your presence. The guards at the tent raise the alarm and a troop of Bhanarians come running from the doorway of a nearby hall.</p>
       <p><quote>Run!</quote> cries Gildas, as the soldiers come rushing towards you.</p>

       <p><quote>Yes, and we must exploit our advantage to the full,</quote> you reply. <quote>You and your men must untie their horses and scatter them so that they cannot pursue us when I snatch the Claw of Naar, literally, from beneath their leader<ch.apos/>s nose.</quote></p>
       <p>The rangers approve of your plan and they are eager to put it into action. Gildas and his men mount up and skirt around the copse in a wide arc until they are in position on the far side, within sight of the enemy<ch.apos/>s unguarded mounts. They take your horse in tow, for your plan is to rejoin them and make a speedy escape as soon as you have retrieved the Claw. Meanwhile, you approach the copse and halt within sight of the campfire. Only one of the Imperial Guardsmen is still awake, and although he has been posted to stand watch, you see that he is having difficulty keeping his eyes open. The squad leader is tossing and turning in his sleep, as if he is having a bad dream, and as you inch closer to him you fear that he could awaken at any moment.</p>

Then you send your fiery missile arcing towards a pool of oil on the ground in front of the charging Xanon. It plunges into the black puddle and ignites with a terrific Whoomph!, exploding a searing ball of flame and black smoke into the air. The heat of the fireball forces the Xanon to retreat, but as they pull back, you become aware of a new threat.</p>
       <p>Some Xanon have ridden in a wide arc around the ruins and have come up behind your position. You hear their leader snorting gruffly as he leaps into the ruined hall, and quickly you spin around to face him. Shouldering your bow, you unsheathe your Kai Weapon and leap forward to block him before he can launch a surprise attack upon the backs of your three companions.</p>

You fight well and slay those who attack you, but the hall is soon awash with reinforcements and you are forced to surrender.</p>
       <p>The rangers are also captured, and together you are taken before the Sergeant of the Guard. He denounces you as would-be thieves, out to steal provisions, and he orders that your weapons and equipment be confiscated before you are led away and thrown into the dungeons.</p>
       <p>As the heavy door to your cell slams shut, you immediately look for a way out of this grim prison chamber. You try to pick the lock, but your attempt is thwarted when the Sergeant and his guards return. With them is the squad leader of the Imperial Guard, the same man from whom you took the Claw of Naar. He is carrying the accursed artefact, and when the iron door is opened, he points it at you and triggers a fearsome blast of raw energy. In the cramped confines of the cell there is no hope of escaping from its terrible power.

A side of beef is roasting on a spit above this fire, and the soldier<ch.apos/>s plates are heaped high with meat and vegetables.

       <p>Some of the soldiers dining here are Imperial Guards from the squad that you encountered in Sunderer Pass. You scrutinise their faces, yet you cannot see their leader among them. Your compass indicates that the Claw of Naar is nearby; its needle is pointing to a door on the far side of the mess hall.

       <p>And with these words you leave the rangers and make your way to the steep gully where Cloud-dancer lay concealed before it was attacked. As you approach the ravine, your Kai tracking skills direct you towards a small metallic tube that lies hidden among the boulders.</p>
       <p>Hurriedly you scoop up the tube, flip open its hinged lid, and shake a rolled piece of papyrus on to your palm.

He urges you to find and destroy it.</p>

Your Kai instincts tell you that these beasts cannot survive for long beyond the mountain borders of the Doomlands, and soon your suspicions are confirmed when you see them returning north to Naaros.

       <p>Unfortunately, your ploy fails. The squad leader overhears you and he raises the alarm. Suddenly the door to the antechamber is kicked open and a dozen soldiers burst in, armed and eager to protect their esteemed commander.</p>
       <p>You fight bravely and slay most of those who attack you, but the antechamber is soon awash with reinforcements and you are forced to surrender. During the melee, the rangers are also captured, and together you are taken before the Sergeant of the Guard. He denounces you as would-be thieves, out to steal provisions, and he orders that your weapons and equipment be confiscated before you are led away and thrown into the dungeons.</p>
       <p>As the heavy door to your cell slams shut, you immediately look for a way out of this grim prison chamber. You try to pick the lock, but your attempt is thwarted when the Sergeant and his guards return. With them is the squad leader, freshly bathed and sporting a fine new uniform. He is carrying the Claw of Naar, and when the iron door is opened, he points it at you and triggers a fearsome blast of raw energy. In the cramped confines of the cell there is no hope of escaping from its terrible power. In the blink of an eye, you and your brave companions are engulfed and consumed by a terrifying ball of white-hot fire.</p>
       <p>Tragically, your life and your mission end here in the barracks dungeon of Yua Tzhan.</p>

       <p>The squad leader advances along the trench with the Claw of Naar poised to fire a second blast, yet a timely volley of arrows from the rangers forces him to abandon his attack and dive for cover. When he scrambles to his feet, he commands his scattered squad to rally to his cry. They come running forward and he scrambles out of the trench to meet them. Then an arrow skewers the sleeve of his tunic, and he spins around and looses off the second flame-bolt in reply. It explodes among the rocks above and you hear Sergeant Paviz cry out in pain. The crackling hum of the Claw rises to an almost deafening pitch when the leader allows the supernatural weapon to recharge to maximum power. Turning towards the rocks that block the mountain pass, he points the Claw at the base and lets loose a third blast of dark flame which blows a big hole in the heaped debris. With a wild cheer, the Bhanarians race through the smouldering gap and make good their escape along the trail beyond.</p>

       <p>You draw upon your Kai mastery to command the snake to hold its attack. The Conda hesitates, and Gildas reaches for his sword. With one swift and deadly swipe, his blade decapitates the serpent and sends its fangled head spinning through the air, trailing a stream of greenish-yellow venom.</p>
       <p>Breaching a sigh of relief, Gildas wipes his blade on the grubby sleeve of his tunic before slipping it silently into his scabbard.</p>

He draws an arrow to his bow and picks off a lone Bhanarian soldier who is washing his tunic upstream. The luckless soldier topples into the river and is carried towards the bridge by the strong current. Lookouts on the bridge spot his body and they pass word to those along the river bank.

       <p>Shortly after dark, you and your companions make your approach to the river bank a mile upstream from the stone bridge. The rangers have tied their ropes together to provide a length that will reach to the opposite bank. The plan is for you to swim across and secure the rope on the far side. The rangers will then follow you across, using the rope to prevent themselves from being swept away by the strong currents.</p>
       <p>You tie the rope about your waist and wade into the cold dark river. Then you strike out for the opposite bank, swimming diagonally upstream to counter its swift flow. You are halfway across when your rope snags on something below the surface. Furiously you tug at it but to no avail. Then you see a glistening mound begin to rise up from the water. Two slits open, revealing the pupils of two monstrous eyes. Then a wider slit appears below them, filled with jagged fangs. Your rope disappears into the corner of this ghastly maw, and as the mouth opens and closes, so you are pulled ever closer to these deadly fangs.</p>

       <p>For most of the day you ride across a seemingly endless expanse of grassland without once catching sight of the enemy you are pursuing. It is nearly dusk before your keen eyes detect a column of woodsmoke on the horizon, rising vertically in the still evening air. You call the rangers to a halt and then magnify your vision to take a closer look at the source of the smoke. It rises from a small copse of trees and you suspect that the enemy have set up a camp there for the night. The smoke tells you that they are cooking food, confident in the false belief that they have safely outdistanced you and your companions.</p>
       <p>You inform the others of what you have seen before continuing your ride along the plains road. When you are within a mile of the copse, you leave the trail and dismount. Sergeant Paviz and Ranger Yalin are told to stay and hold the horses while you and the Captain go forward to scout the enemy encampment.</p>
       <p>Together you crawl towards the copse, side by side, concealed by the approaching darkness and the waist-high grass. You are within 100 metres of the enemy campfire when Gildas makes a sharp intake of breath. You glance at him and your blood freezes when you see that his face is inches from a Grey Conda<ch.emdash/>a deadly Bhanarian plains snake. The serpent<ch.apos/>s neck is raised and its wedge-shaped head is drawn to strike at your companion<ch.apos/>s eyes.</p>

       <p>You see the fearsome figure of Autarch Sejanoz come stepping through the chamber<ch.apos/>s shattered window. He alights from the platform of his golden sky-chariot which hovers silently beside the tower. Sheathed from neck to toe in black and golden armour, this warrior stands an arm<ch.apos/>s length taller than you and your companions. A great tiger helm conceals his face and behind him swirls a voluminous scarlet cloak. Only his hands are visible and they seem strangely at odds with the grand scale and design of his armour. They are withered and twisted like claws, the skin wrinkled and cracked like burnt parchment. Hanging over them are four long, curved, needle-like claws of steel that sprout from the back of the golden bracers which encase his wrists.</p>
       <p>Gildas and his men reach for their bows and fire repeatedly at the Autarch, yet every arrow they send against him ends shattered. From the visor of his helm there issues a thin, chilling laugh: <quote>You cannot kill me with your sharpened sticks, you fools!</quote> Upon hearing this, Paviz and Yalin drop their bows and unsheathe their blades. Paviz shouts a much-practiced cue, and together they attack the Autarch, striking simultaneously from either side.</p>
       <p>With stunning swiftness, Sejanoz retaliates. He reaches out and grabs each man by the throat with his cadaverous hands, and raises them several inches from the floor. With a series of metallic clicks, the needle-claws extend and turn inwards, puncturing their jugular veins. Their faces blanch as their blood is drained, and not a drop is spilt.</p>

       <p>You thank Gildas for this history lesson, but you question its accuracy. <quote>I was taught at the Kai Monastery that the reign of Khea Khan Xo was more than a thousand years ago. Surely his enemy then was not the same Autarch Sejanoz who rules Bhanar now?</quote></p>
       <p><quote>Ah, but he is!</quote> replies Gildas. <quote>Sejanoz has ruled this land for 3,000 years. Legend says that he entered into a pact with Agarash the Damned. In return for his soul he received<ch.ellips/> immortality.</quote></p>

       <p>Instinctively you reach for the hilt of your Kai Weapon, but Rimoah stays your hand. <quote>Hold, Grand Master. These are not our enemies<ch.emdash/>they<ch.apos/>re our friends.</quote></p>
       <p>The four gaunt, grey, grime-encrusted figures leave their hiding places and move slowly towards the cage. It is not until their leader smiles and reveals his white teeth that you realize they are human. The many weeks that these Siyenese rangers have spent in the hell of the Doomlands have exacted upon them a heavy toll.</p>
       <p><quote>Greetings, Lord Rimoah,</quote> says the leader. <quote>I am Captain Gildas of the King<ch.apos/>s Ranger Regiment, and these are my men<ch.emdash/>Sergeant Paviz, Ranger Durasso, and Ranger Yalin. We<ch.apos/>re glad you<ch.apos/>ve arrived before the enemy, though by no more than a few hours at best.</quote></p>
       <p>Captain Gildas looks at you and bows his head reverently. <quote>We<ch.apos/>re honoured by your presence, Sir Kai. I was lucky to be in Seroa last year when Karvas was crowned King, and I witnessed your knighthood in the Palace Square. We Siyenese will be forever in your debt for ridding us of that usurper<ch.emdash/>Baron Sadanzo.</quote></p>
       <p>You thank the Ranger Captain for his compliment and tell him that you have come here with Lord Rimoah to help capture the Claw of Naar. <quote>It is vital that Sejanoz be denied the Claw,</quote> you say earnestly, <quote><ch.lellips/>at all costs.</quote></p>
       <p><quote>Fear not, Sir Kai,</quote> he replies with confidence. <quote>We have laid a trap to ensnare the enemy and their foul relic. They<ch.apos/>ll not get out of Sunderer Pass. Come, we shall show you what we have prepared, but first you must conceal your skyship before the enemy arrive. Look over there, Lord Rimoah,</quote> says Gildas, pointing to a distant ravine, <quote>that gully is deceptively deep. It will swallow your ship without trace. You must hide it there. But first, may ask a favour?</quote> Rimoah nods in reply.</p>
       <p><quote>Our provisions are exhausted. We have some water, but we<ch.apos/>ve had nothing to eat for days. Can you spare some food before you depart?</quote></p>
       <p><quote>Of course, Captain,</quote> replies Rimoah. <quote>I<ch.apos/>ll have the bo<ch.apos/>sun drop provisions this instant.</quote></p>
       <p>Rimoah climbs into the boarding cage and is winched up to the rear deck of Cloud-dancer. Within minutes, the cage descends once more, laden with food and water. With a gleeful cry, Gildas throws open the cage door and he and his men leap upon the provisions like ravenous wolves. What little they fail to consume immediately they stow away in their empty backpacks for later.</p>
       <p>As Cloud-dancer moves off to seek cover in the distant ravine, Captain Gildas leads you to the mouth of Sunderer Pass and shows you the preparations that he had his men have made in readiness to ambush the enemy squad.</p>

       <p>Your journey south is favoured by a cooling breeze which sweeps down across the plain from the Hyunsei Mountains. Shortly before noon, you see a tented encampment in the far distance. Small crimson pennants flutter from its striped awnings, and groups of women and children can be seen walking along the banks of a nearby stream.</p>

       <p>When the woman senses that her psychic attack has failed, she collapses upon the track, bent over on all fours like a dying beast. She twitches and wriggles uncontrollably, and, before your disbelieving eyes, her body begins to change. Her marble-smooth skin becomes criss-crossed with a net of a thousand wrinkles and her abdomen swells like an over-inflated balloon. Then there is a terrible sound, like the rending of bone and flesh, and suddenly the illusion of her beauty is dispelled forever when this fell vampiric shape-changer reverts to its true form.</p>
       <p>Confronting you now is a leprous horror with a huge, fang-filled maw. It roars with anger and a gust of its putrid breath wafts over you, turning your stomach with its vile stench. The rangers and their horses are snapped out of their hypnotic trance by the sound of its fearsome cry and, gripped by a sudden panic, they turn and flee into the trees. Hurriedly you follow them, forcing your mount to battle its way through a tangle of barb-toothed briar in your desperation to escape from the wrath of this demonic creature.</p>

Your companions are putting up a brave fight, but they face the danger of being surrounded on both sides and trapped in the corridor.</p>

Fixed above its barrel is a large iron cylinder. It is studded with heavy rivets and fitted with a springed valve that bubbles and hisses like an angry serpent. You surmise this device is a steam-powered cannon, and you fear that if it is fired along the corridor it could slay your companions with one blast. As the Bhanarian gunners begin loading their weapon with handfuls of rusty nails and lead shot, you know you must find some way to stop them from firing this devilish device.</p>

       <p>The old man invites you all to come into his tent. You dismount, and the children look after your horses while you file into his spacious dwelling. He gives each of you a glass of mulled wine and a piece of unleavened bread, and while you are enjoying the plain fare, he invites you to examine the wares and trinkets that lie strewn about the tent.</p>
       <p>Gildas nudges you and points to a rickety table that is heaped with simple straw-coloured robes, much-favoured by Bhanarian plainsmen. <quote>These may be a wise purchase, Sir Kai?</quote> he mutters. <quote>I fear our tunics may arouse suspicion the further south we venture.</quote> You nod in agreement and ask the old man how much he wants for four of his robes.</p>
       <p><quote>One hundred and twenty Ren, kind sir,</quote> he replies, cheerfully.</p>
       <p>The old man<ch.apos/>s price is the equivalent of 12 Gold Crowns. The rangers do not have any money, so if you wish to purchase these garments you must pay the full price.</p>

       <p>Before the guard can reload his musket and fire again, you reach the end of the roof and climb down the trunk of the tree. Gildas and his men follow your lead, and when all of you are safely on the ground, you pause for a few moments to assess the situation. From beneath the leafy boughs of the young oak, you look out across the parade ground and scan the buildings that border upon it. Bhanarian soldiers are running everywhere, seemingly in confusion. Then you realize that they all have a purpose: they are rushing to secure every entrance and exit from the barracks.</p>
       <p>Gildas points to a building on the west side of the parade ground. Its doors are open and unguarded. You magnify your vision and see that it is part of the barracks stables. Its well-lit interior is busy with troopers who are preparing their mounts for tomorrow<ch.apos/>s ceremonial parade through the city. Beyond its rows of stalls is an archway that opens on to one of the city<ch.apos/>s streets. You inform the rangers of what you have seen and you decide that the stables offer you your best hope for an escape from the barracks. Using the perimeter trees for cover, you skirt around the parade ground and make your approach to the stables.

It is not until you see the outline of a broken stone watchtower silhouetted on the southern horizon that you slow your pace and point your tired mount towards it. Upon reaching the derelict tower you discover that it stands beside a pond of fresh water. You let the horses drink their fill and, as they recover their strength, you and your companions explore the lower levels of the ruin.</p>
       <p>The tower is empty and overgrown with weeds. All that it contains are several blocks of stone engraved with ancient designs, which are illuminated by streams of moonlight filtering down through the holes in the shattered roof. You take the opportunity to examine the Claw, and as you unfold its covering blanket on one of the blocks, you find yourself both fascinated and repulsed by the intricacies of its evil design. The head of the Claw resembles a petrified vulture<ch.apos/>s foot, cast in a black metal that is flecked with shimmering scarlet specks. Its shaft is twisted, like a length of gnarled root, and it is perforated along its length with pea-sized hollows.</p>
       <p>A palpable evil radiates from this dread artefact and you feel an overwhelming compulsion to destroy it. You tell the rangers to stand clear, and then you unsheathe your Kai Weapon and deal the shaft of the Claw a mighty blow.</p>

       <p>By twisting the dial of the wall safe to an incorrect setting you unwittingly set off an alarm in a distant barracks guardroom. Suddenly the door to the antechamber is forced open and in burst a dozen soldiers, armed with spears and axes.</p>
       <p>You draw your Kai Weapon and fight bravely, slaying most who dare come within a sword<ch.apos/>s length, but the chamber is soon awash with reinforcements and ultimately you are forced to drop your weapons and surrender.

       <p>Then you see an unexpected sight: Cloud-dancer rises out of the gully and ascends rapidly into the darkening sky. You magnify your vision and witness a bloody battle raging along her decks as the winged beasts attempt to wrest control of the helm.

Using your enhanced vision, you focus on the leader and your Kai senses reel at the aura of evil surrounding him. You sense that this power does not emanate from him directly; it flows around a mace-like weapon which he carries sheathed in his belt. It is the Claw of Naar, and even at a distance its malignant power fills you with unease and foreboding.</p>
       <p>With bated breath, you watch the Autarch<ch.apos/>s men come marching along the narrow trail. Captain Gildas gives the signal to Durasso to spring the ambush, and the ranger tugs hard on the rope in his hands. There is a moment of silence, then a thunderous rumble reverberates through the mountains.

Your Kai instincts tell you that these beasts cannot survive for long beyond the mountain borders of the Doomlands, and soon you see them returning north to Naaros. When the last of the creatures has disappeared, you beckon Gildas and his men to follow you down on to the mountain trail. Here you discover the bodies of two Imperial Guards who were caught by the rockslide ambush and crushed to death.</p>

       <p>As the flying creature disappears over the lip of the ravine, you wrench your foot free from the cleft in the boulder. Instantly, you fall towards the base of the steep gully, but your natural agility enables you to twist in mid-air and land safely on your feet without sustaining any further injuries.</p>
       <p>You quickly ascend the steeply sloping wall and retrieve the steel tube from the slate outcrop. You tuck it into your belt, then you climb back to the top of the ravine where you pause to examine what the tube contains.</p>

       <p>Your Kai sense warns you that the one-eyed man and his cohorts are waiting outside in the main square. They are determined to ambush you and your companions the moment you step from the inn. Wary of their intentions, you ask the innkeeper if there is another exit from the taproom and he points to a curtained archway. It conceals a door which opens on to an alleyway running alongside the inn. You leave by this door and walk to the end of the alley, taking care to avoid the main square. Your mind is now focused upon the task of finding and retrieving the Claw of Naar before Autarch Sejanoz arrives, and when you consult your Siyenese compass, you set off in the direction it indicates. It leads you towards the military quarter of the city, located on the east side of the main square. You follow an avenue lined with closed shop doorways, and soon you arrive at a busy barracks. The compass, and your Kai sixth sense, both tell you that the Claw of Naar is located somewhere inside this troop-infested building.</p>

       <p>You sleep poorly and wake feeling drained and disheartened: lose 2 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points. Shortly after dawn, you break camp and set off across the marshlands, heading east. At first the spongy ground comes as a welcome relief after the jagged rocks and twisted roots that litter the floor of the Angfeng Forest. Then the marshy soil degenerates into a treacherous swamp, and soon you are forced to head south in search of firmer terrain.</p>
       <p>For two days and nights you trek across wetlands, living as best you can off the flora and fauna of this inhospitable region. By noon of the third day you catch sight of a stone bridge across the River Heng, on the outskirts of a town called Zuda. The rangers are excited at the prospect of escaping at last from the mosquito-infested wetlands, but their enthusiasm is dampened when you magnify your vision and take a closer look at this Chai border town.</p>

After several minutes, you see your enemy entering the valley and come galloping along the trail. You magnify your vision in order to observe them as they approach the pillars. Suddenly there is a vivid flash of blue-white light when one of the Imperial Guards brushes past the column of stone in the middle track. You let out a cheer when you see the leading riders tumble from their saddles, and your companions echo your cry when you tell them what you have witnessed.</p>
       <p>Seizing the advantage, you urge your stallion to the gallop and speed away from the ridge with your ranger companions following closely on your heels.</p>

       <p>The old man is deeply hurt by your refusal to take bread and wine with him. It is considered a grave insult in Bhanar to refuse such basic hospitality. Some of the young men who have gathered outside the tent to watch you, now begin to reach for their daggers. Anxious to avoid any needless bloodshed, Captain Gildas intervenes and accepts the old man<ch.apos/>s offer on your behalf. <quote>He<ch.apos/>s a Northlander,</quote> he says, by way of an apology on your behalf. <quote>He knows nothing of your customs.</quote></p>
       <p>The old man smiles and nods his head, then he invites you all to come into his tent. You dismount, and the children look after your horses while you file into his spacious dwelling. He gives each of you a glass of mulled wine and a piece of unleavened bread, and while you are enjoying this plain fare, he invites you to examine the wares and trinkets which lie strewn about his tent.</p>
       <p>Gildas nudges you and points to a rickety table that is heaped with simple straw-coloured robes, much-favoured by Bhanarian plainsmen. <quote>These may be a wise investment, Sir Kai?</quote> he mutters. <quote>I fear our tunics may arouse suspicion the further south we venture.</quote></p>
       <p>You nod in agreement and ask the old man how much he wants for four of his robes.</p>
       <p><quote>One hundred and sixty Ren, kind sir,</quote> he replies, cheerfully.</p>
       <p>The old man<ch.apos/>s price is equivalent to 16 Gold Crowns. The rangers do not have any money, so if you wish to purchase these garments you must pay the full price.</p>

       <p>Sejanoz approaches the fire and stoops to retrieve the Claw, but then he hesitates. His skeletal hand trembles and he seems powerless to control it. You sense that he is afraid of the flames: it is his one vital weakness.</p>
       <p>You rush towards him and land a kick to his side, toppling him over. Before he can rise again, you grab the haft of the Claw and tug it from the fire. A burning log is skewered upon its tip. It flares brightly when you thrust it at the Autarch<ch.apos/>s helm and rolls away, towards the shattered window. You follow up and jab it at his hands, and he shrieks with fear. Then he tries to stand, and as he is levering himself up from the floor, you leap into the air and land a two-footed kick to his chest that sends him somersaulting backwards. With a wailing cry, he tumbles out of the window and plummets into the courtyard below.</p>

       <p>With these words, you slip away from your hiding place and make your way back to the rocky mouth of the pass, using your Kai camouflage skills to keep yourself hidden from the enemy. As you approach the ravine, you hear the sounds of fierce fighting and see intermittent flashes of magical energy piercing the gloom. The winged horde are making a determined attack upon the grounded skyship, but Lord Rimoah and his young crewmen are putting up a spirited defence.</p>
       <p>When you reach the edge of the ravine, you are confronted by the unexpected sight of Cloud-dancer rising rapidly into the darkening sky. A bloody battle is raging along her decks as the winged beasts attempt to wrest control of the skyship from the crew. You magnify your vision and catch sight of Lord Rimoah standing at the craft<ch.apos/>s stern, near to the boarding cage. For a few moments your eyes meet and you make a telepathic link. He hurls a metallic tube in your direction and you hear his voice in your mind, urging you to retrieve it. Then the link is broken when he is forced to defend himself from a determined attacker. You watch the tube strike a rock at the edge of the ravine, and then it disappears from sight. With fear running cold in your veins, you watch helplessly as the beleaguered skyship powers away towards the east, pursued by the flying swarm of ravening beasts.</p>

       <p>You tell the rangers what you have discovered, and suggest that they rest awhile under the wooden bridge while you attempt to lure a distant group of stallions towards the stream. By the use of your Magnakai Discipline of Animal Control, you are able to entice four horses to approach the bridge. At first they are nervous, for they can detect the vile stench of the Doomlands<ch.apos/> dust which impregnates the rangers<ch.apos/> tunics, but they are also thirsty and they cannot resist for too long the temptation of the sparkling stream.</p>
       <p>You allow them to drink at the stream for several minutes and, as they settle, you slowly approach the leading stallion. You are reaching out to take hold of his mane when he suddenly rises up on his hind legs and flails at you with his hooves.</p>

       <p>You see the unmistakable shape of Cloud-dancer silhouetted against the rising sun. It hovers above the central keep of Fort Jhung, and with the wind in your hair and a cry of victory on your lips, you bank your sky-chariot towards it.</p>
       <p>Lord Rimoah and Lord Ghadra are among the many on deck who are anxiously watching and praying for you to appear, though no one is expecting your arrival will be by air. The crew can hardly believe their eyes when you bring the sky-chariot down to land upon the deck. Within seconds of touching down, you are surrounded by a mass of cheering countrymen.</p>
       <p>Lord Rimoah appears among the excited throng. With tears of joy in his eyes, he embraces you and then offers up a prayer of thanksgiving to Goddess Ishir for your safe return. You deliver to him the Claw of Naar and he vows that this accursed artefact will be destroyed by the Elder Magi to prevent it from ever falling into the hands of Autarch Sejanoz.</p>
       <p>Congratulations, Grand Master. You have met this difficult challenge and you have triumphed. Your brave and daring exploits will long be remembered in the legends of the New Order Kai. Yet the fight against Evil goes on. Soon your courage and Kai skills will be tested anew. The nature of the quest and the dangers that await you will be revealed in the next exciting Lone Wolf adventure entitled:</p>
