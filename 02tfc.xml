     <p>Ancient days they were when first the Shianti set foot upon the land that men call Magnamund. Long had they journeyed through the void, homeless wanderers in search of a pace to call their own. And so it was that when the Shianti first looked upon the face of the land, their hearts were raised in wonder. They saw a world of nameless mountains, untamed forests, and lands both wild and free. Here they chose to cease their wanderings and to devote themselves to the study and appreciation of this newfound land.</p>
     <p>To the delight of the Shianti, the race of man first emerged at this time and they watched his early struggle towards civilization with eager concern. Like gods, the Shianti seemed to the minds of primitive men. Tall and proud, shining with a radiance that spoke of magic and arcane mystery, the Shianti moved among them and with their powers of wizardry, aided man in his development.</p>
     <p>As the centuries passed, man fell to worship of the magical Shianti and the power of these wizards grew even stronger. With hungry hearts they sought to unlock the mysteries of knowledge, sending their minds into other planes of existence and strange worlds beyond the sphere of the material plane. Their foresight was now unmatched and the power of their thought was mighty indeed. It was at this time that they created the Moonstone. Woven of the very fabric of the astral plane of Daziarn, this translucent gem was the greatest achievement of Shianti wisdom. It was the binding force of all Shianti magic, containing the combined might of all their <!--ERRTAG-RE-7887-->wizardry<!--/ERRTAG-RE-7887-->, the sum of all their knowledge. The Golden Age of the Shianti had come and the Moonstone was the instrument of their dominion throughout all Magnamund. Man stood as little more than a shadow, blinded by the shining white light of Shianti glory. But, in creating the Moonstone, the unwritten laws of nature had been transgressed. For the Moonstone, like the Shianti themselves, was something outside of man<ch.apos/>s own world; it defied the natural order laid down by the creators of Magnamund and disrupted the balance that the gods had designed.</p>
     <p>The Goddess Ishir, High Priestess of the Moon and mother of all men, showed herself to the Shianti and spoke to them of the destiny of man: <quote>The children of this world must claim their inheritance. Their time has come and they must learn to stand alone. They are lost in their worship of you and the day draws ever nearer when they will covet the power of the Moonstone.</quote></p>
     <p>And the Shianti said: <quote>Forgive us, Great Goddess, for we intended no harm. We love mankind even as you do. We have sought to do good and protect your children from harm.</quote></p>
     <p>But Ishir replied, <quote>Of this there can be no doubt, but this world is not your realm. Man must be free to pursue his destiny alone, and you must leave, for you trespass on his domain.</quote></p>
     <p>The Shianti were filled with sorrow. They feared a return to the void and to their lonely wandering, and pleaded with Ishir that she might allow them to remain. Ishir was filled with pity for them. She spoke again, saying, <quote>If you are to remain, you must obey my command. You must take a vow never to interfere with mankind<ch.apos/>s fate. As a token of good faith you must lay aside the Moonstone, and return it to the plane where it belongs.</quote></p>
     <p>Solemnly, the Shianti agreed. The vow was sworn before Ishir, and the Moonstone was returned to the Daziarn. The Shianti then moved south to the Isle of Lorn. They encircled their new home with a web of enchantments, magical mists, and mage winds to prevent man from ever finding their place of refuge in the Sea of Dreams. Knowledge of the Shianti faded with time, save in southern Magnamund where it became enshrined in legend, and the worship of them endured. Priests of the Shianti religion preserved their teachings and patiently awaited the day when the <quote>ancient ones</quote> would return, bringing with them lasting peace and the blessing of a new golden age.</p>
     <p>Two thousand years strode by and man advanced as Ishir had foretold. He built great cities and cultivated the land; his kingdoms rose and fell; he made war and loved and laughed and became master of his fate. But a new power was emerging in the province of Shadaki. There Shasarak the evil Wytch-king ruled. The black necromancer commanded an army of brutal soldiers and had a devoted following of men who upheld his religion of demonic worship and sacrificial rites. Devotees of the Shianti and other religious cults were persecuted in a merciless purge. Ruthlessly, the Wytch-king destroyed all his opponents and began a terrible war with the peoples of the neighbouring provinces. From the ruins of war Shasarak shaped the Shadakine Empire, subjugating whole nations to his evil rule. As the provinces fell to his might, the Shianti looked on helplessly, bound by their vow to the Goddess Ishir never to interfere in the affairs of man.</p>
     <p>On the night of the crowning of Shasarak as Overlord of the Shadakine Empire, a great storm broke upon the Sea of Dreams, a storm that raged with unnatural intensity. Lashed by wind and rain, illuminated by wild lightning, the waters heaved and danced in fury to the thundering music of the storm, unchecked by even the enchantments of the Shianti. When finally the tempest died, the Shianti looked out in amazement on the shattered hull of a ship drifting towards their shore. Never before had this occurred, for the enchantments and mage winds had kept them secure from the curiosity of man by forcing him to sail close to his own land.</p>
     <p>The Shianti went quickly to the ruined ship where they found only one survivor<ch.emdash/>a baby. They perceived the sudden arrival of this human child as a sign of great portent, and they conceived a plan by which they might lawfully aid mankind. They named the orphan child Grey Star, because a star is the symbol of hope in the Shianti faith, and because of the silver streak in the child<ch.apos/>s jet-black hair. In the shadow of the wrath of the Goddess Ishir, they raised the child as one of their own and taught him their secrets. Diligently they set about their instruction, for their aim was to provide a saviour for mankind. Armed with the might of Shianti wizardry and wisdom, their hope was to create an adversary equal in power to the evil Wytch-king of Shadaki, for they realized that only with the death of Shasarak would man once more be free to determine his destiny.</p>

     <p>You are Grey Star, trained in the ancient lore of a Shianti Wizard. For sixteen years you dwelt in safety on the Isle of Lorn, the hidden realm of the magical Shianti race, until Acarya, High Wizard of the Shianti sent you upon a dangerous quest to save your own people, the race of man, from Shasarak, the tyrannical Wytch-king of Shadaki. Held by their ancient vow to the goddess Ishir, the Shianti are unable to leave their island and come to the aid of man themselves. As a human, no such promise prohibits you from leaving the island and you have been sent to recover the Moonstone and use its power to throw down the Wytch-king.</p>
     <p>The Moonstone, an artefact possessing the combined force of all Shianti power, is hidden on the Daziarn plane, which can only be entered by finding one of its portals. You seek the Shadow Gate, but it never remains in one place for longer than a day and is invisible to human sight. For this reason you began to search for the <quote>Lost Tribe of Lara,</quote> a race of magical, but primitive creatures called the Kundi. They possess the gift of Astral Vision, enabling them to see magic portals and gateways to other planes and dimensions. Once, the Kundi inhabited the forests of the Mountains of Lara. When Shasarak<ch.apos/>s Shadakine army first invaded the free provinces of the south, they came by way of the Mountains of Lara, through the Morn Pass. The Shadakine armies were constantly ambushed and delayed by the Kundi as they made their way south, and the Kundi always eluded them, disappearing into the dense forest before the Shadakine could retaliate. Finally, in desperation, the Wytch-king burnt down the mountain<ch.apos/>s forests and the Kundi were forced to flee from his wrath and disappeared. Only the vision and the guidance of a Kundi man will enable you to enter the Daziarn plane and find the Moonstone, and less than a month ago you began your search.</p>
     <p>Voyaging across the Sea of Dreams, you came first to the city of Suhn, the largest port in the Shadakine Empire. There you befriended a cheerful merchant named Shan Li, a widely travelled man with a wry sense of humour. Your questions about the Lost Tribe, enemies of the Shadakine Empire, aroused much suspicion. You were taken to the dungeons of the House of Correction, the Shadakine prison of Suhn and subjected to the truthsay of Mother Magri, Shadakine Wytch and Law-giver. With the power of the Kazim Stone, she attempted to read your mind, but you were able to preserve the secret of your quest.</p>
     <p>It was with the help of Tanith, a young, beautiful girl, learning the ways of wytchcraft in the service of Mother Magri, that you made your escape from the House of Correction. Her courage and intelligence were invaluable as you escaped the pursuit of the Shadakine. With Shan as your guide you eventually turned south and headed toward the region known as the Azanam, for it seemed likely that the Lost Tribe might be found there. But the vengeance of Mother Magri was not so easily avoided. Using the power of the Kazim Stone, she summoned a Kleas<ch.aacute/>, a demon shadow that feeds upon the soul and will of others, since it has no soul of its own. Neither your Magical Powers, nor the might of your Wizard<ch.apos/>s Staff seemed able to defeat the Kleas<ch.aacute/> and it had almost destroyed you when Tanith cast a spell and called the demon against her. She was totally consumed by the Kleas<ch.aacute/> and both disappeared in flame. Her brave sacrifice saved your life.</p>
     <p>With a heavy heart, you and Shan continued south, entering the arid desert of the Azagad Gorge. Here, Shan fell, poisoned and consumed by a Quoku, the flying amphibian indigenous to those parts. After a desperate chase through the tunnels of a Cave Mantiz nest (giant insects that lair within the cliff) you eventually reached the jungles of the Azanam, and there, high in their towering treetop home, you found the Lost Tribe of Lara. But your arrival was met with great suspicion: the Kundi did not believe that you had been sent by the Shianti. In the house of Okosa, the Kundi King, Urik the wise, their strange, eccentric shaman and elder of their tribe, challenged you to prove you were truly sent by the Shianti by answering a strange riddle:</p>
     <blockquote>
      <p>
       <line><ch.lsquot/>Wise Shianti and Kundi man<!--ERRTAG-AD-21154-->,<!--/ERRTAG-AD-21154--></line>
       <line>Look eye to eye in tree,</line>
       <line>Shianti man see Kundi man,</line>
       <line>But what does Kundi see?<ch.rsquot/></line>
      </p>
     </blockquote>
     <p>To discover the answer to the riddle and to continue your search for the Moonstone and the Shadow Gate that leads there, turn to <a idref="sect1"><!--ERRTAG-RE-21566-->Section 1<!--/ERRTAG-RE-21566--></a>.</p>

      <p>If you have completed <cite>Grey Star the Wizard</cite>, your <typ class="attribute">WILLPOWER</typ> score will be zero before you begin this book. It doesn<ch.apos/>t seem fair to start this book with only 10 <typ class="attribute">WILLPOWER</typ> points, so you may choose to create a new <typ class="attribute">WILLPOWER</typ> score by choosing a number from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> and adding 20. You may also choose to add the 10 <typ class="attribute">WILLPOWER</typ> point bonus to this new score.</p>
      <p>Alternatively, you may wish to use your original <typ class="attribute">WILLPOWER</typ> score from the beginning of <cite>Grey Star the Wizard</cite>, and add 10 bonus points to this.</p>

     <footnote id="gamerulz-4-foot" idref="gamerulz-4"><p>There are sections of this book that describe how you use a Magical Power and how many <typ class="attribute">WILLPOWER</typ> points you spend, without giving you a choice and without taking into account that you may not have the required number of <typ class="attribute">WILLPOWER</typ> points left. You may choose to simply subtract the specified number of <typ class="attribute">WILLPOWER</typ> points. This may leave you with a negative <typ class="attribute">WILLPOWER</typ> score, or if it was already negative, it will make your score become even more negative.</p>
      <p>Alternatively, you may may wish to use a method given in <bookref series="gs" book="04wotw" section="sect175">Section 175</bookref> of <bookref series="gs" book="04wotw"><cite>War of the Wizards</cite></bookref>, which contains one such case of mandated use of magic: If you do not have enough <typ class="attribute">WILLPOWER</typ> points, then you use <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points at a rate of 2 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points for every 1 <typ class="attribute">WILLPOWER</typ> point you lack (i.e. 2 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points = 1 <typ class="attribute">WILLPOWER</typ> point). If your <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> score falls to zero or below, you are dead and the adventure is over.</p>
      <p>Note that you may never <em>choose</em> to use a Magical Power or your Wizard<ch.apos/>s Staff if you do not have sufficient <typ class="attribute">WILLPOWER</typ> points. This method also cannot be used in cases where you lose <typ class="attribute">WILLPOWER</typ> points for a reason other than using magic, for instance as a result of mental or magical attacks. In these cases, you may end up with a negative <typ class="attribute">WILLPOWER</typ> score.</p></footnote>
       <footnote id="gamerulz-3-foot" idref="gamerulz-3"><p>It is possible for your <typ class="attribute">WILLPOWER</typ> to fall below zero. For example, if you are the victim of an attack that drains your <typ class="attribute">WILLPOWER</typ>, your score may be forced below zero.

All weapons and Special Items that you held at the end of <bookref series="gs" book="01gstw">Book 1</bookref> should be entered on a fresh <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>. You are now ready to begin this adventure.</p>
     <p>If this is your first adventure, read on<ch.ellips/></p>
     <p>To keep a record of your adventure, use the <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
     <p>Before you set off on your adventure, you must discover how well your Shianti masters have prepared you for your quest by determining your fighting prowess<ch.emdash/><typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ><ch.emdash/>your state of mind<ch.emdash/><typ class="attribute">WILLPOWER</typ><ch.emdash/>and your physical stamina<ch.emdash/><typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ>. To do this take a pencil and, with eyes closed, point with the blunt end of it on to the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a>. If you pick 0 it counts as zero.</p>
     <p>The first number that you pick from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> in this way represents your <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ>. Add 10 to the number you picked and write the total in the <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> section of your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>. (e.g., if your pencil fell on the number 4 in the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> you would write in a <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> of 14.) When you fight, your <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> will be pitted against that of your enemy. A high score in this section is therefore very desirable.</p>
     <p>The second number that you pick from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> represents your <typ class="attribute">WILLPOWER</typ>. Add 20 to this number and write the total in the <typ class="attribute">WILLPOWER</typ> section of your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a> (e.g., if your pencil fell on the number 6 in the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> you would have a <typ class="attribute">WILLPOWER</typ> of 26). If you decide to use a spell or utilize the power of your Wizard<ch.apos/>s Staff, then you will lose <typ class="attribute">WILLPOWER</typ> points. If at any time your <typ class="attribute">WILLPOWER</typ> falls to zero or below, you may not use any of your spells<a id="gamerulz-4" idref="gamerulz-4-foot" class="footnote" /> or your Wizard<ch.apos/>s Staff.<a id="gamerulz-3" idref="gamerulz-3-foot" class="footnote"/> Lost <typ class="attribute">WILLPOWER</typ> points can be regained during the course of the adventure, and it is possible for your <typ class="attribute">WILLPOWER</typ> points to rise above the total with which you start your adventure.</p>
     <p>The third number that you pick from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> represents your powers of <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ>. Add 20 to this number and write the total in the <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> section of your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a> (e.g., if your pencil fell on the number 6 on the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> you would have 26 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points). If you are wounded in combat, you will lose <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points. If at any time your <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points fall to zero or below, you are dead and the adventure is over. Lost <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points can be regained during the course of the adventure but can never rise above the number with which you start your adventure.</p>

A wizard wishing to speak with the dead, or to call up a form from the spirit world, must draw a magic pentacle and enter a trance, when the use of the correct spell-chant will reach out to the Spiritual Plane. Standing within the protection of a magic pentacle, a wizard may consider himself to be relatively safe from harm. If he wishes to speak with a corpse, especially one whose former life was good and righteous, then a wizard can expect help and advice. However, contact with those whose former lives were evil or selfish can be a perilous, and often fatal, experience. Evil spirits are reluctant to return to the realm of the dead and may try to trick a wizard into freeing them into the world of the living. All spirits, good and evil, will require some service of the wizard in return for their aid. Any failure to perform this task, however difficult, may result in the wizard losing his life.</p>

This is your main combat weapon, for you are untrained in the use of any other form of armed combat. It contains a potent force that is unleashed at will by the power of your mind, and causes a beam of destructive power to hurtle from its tip. Every time you unleash this power you must deduct 1 <typ class="attribute">WILLPOWER</typ> point.<a id="powers-1" idref="powers-1-foot" class="footnote" /></p>
         <p>In the event that your enemy survives such an attack or should you fall victim to a surprise attack, you will be forced to engage in close combat and must attempt to strike your enemy with the Staff. If your attack is successful, a bolt of energy will be released from the Staff that is capable of inflicting great physical harm. If you wish to increase the amount of damage that you inflict in this way, you must use more <typ class="attribute">WILLPOWER</typ> points and multiply the number of <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points lost by the enemy, accordingly. For example, if you chose to expend 3 <typ class="attribute">WILLPOWER</typ> points on your attack, all enemy <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> point losses would be multiplied by three.</p>
         <p>If you enter combat without your Staff, deduct 6 points from your <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> If you have no weapon at all, you must deduct 8 points from your <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ>.</p>

       <p>There will be occasions during your adventure when you have to fight an enemy. The enemy<ch.apos/>s <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> and <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points are given in the text. Grey Star<ch.apos/>s aim during the combat is to kill the enemy by reducing his <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points to zero while at the same time losing as few <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points as possible himself.</p>
       <p>At the start of a combat, enter Grey Star<ch.apos/>s <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> and <typ class="attribute">WILLPOWER</typ> points and the enemy<ch.apos/>s <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points in the appropriate boxes on the Combat Record section of your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
       <p>The sequence for combat is as follows:</p>
       <ol class="paragraphed">
        <li><p>Calculate your current <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> total, based on the weapon you are using. (Remember, if you enter combat without your Staff, you must deduct 6 points from your <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ>. If you have no weapon at all, you must deduct 8 points.)</p></li>
        <li><p>Subtract the <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> of your enemy from this total. The result is your Combat Ratio. Enter it on the <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>.</p></li>
        <li>
         <p><a id="stage3">If you are using your Wizard<ch.apos/>s Staff</a>, decide how many <typ class="attribute">WILLPOWER</typ> points you wish to use. (Remember, you must expend at least 1 point.) Enter this number on your Combat Record in the box marked <typ class="attribute">WILLPOWER</typ>.</p>
         <p>Example</p>
         <p>Grey Star (<typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> 15, <typ class="attribute">WILLPOWER</typ> 23) is ambushed by a Deathgaunt (<typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> 20). He is not given the opportunity to evade combat, but he can use his Wizard<ch.apos/>s Staff against the creature as it swoops down on him. He subtracts the Deathgaunt<ch.apos/>s <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> from his own, giving a Combat Ratio of <ch.minus/>5. (15 <ch.minus/> 20 = <ch.minus/>5). <ch.minus/>5 is noted on the <a idref="action">Action Chart</a> as the Combat Ratio. Grey Star decides to use 2 <typ class="attribute">WILLPOWER</typ> points, which is noted on the <typ class="attribute">WILLPOWER</typ> box of the Combat Record.</p></li>
        <li><p>When you have decided upon the number of <typ class="attribute">WILLPOWER</typ> points you wish to use, and you have determined your Combat Ratio, pick a number from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a>.</p></li>
        <li>
         <p>Turn to the <a idref="crtable">Combat Results Table</a>. Along the top of the chart are shown the Combat Ratio numbers. Find the number that is the same as your Combat Ratio and cross-reference it With the random number that you have picked. (The random numbers appear on the side of the chart.) You now have the number of <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points lost by Grey Star. To calculate the number lost by the enemy, multiply this by the number of <typ class="attribute">WILLPOWER</typ> points that Grey Star elected to use. Now you have the final number of <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points lost by both Grey Star and his enemy in this round of combat. (E represents points lost by the enemy; GS represents points lost by Grey Star.)</p>

         <p>The Combat Ratio between Grey Star and the Deathgaunt has been established as <ch.minus/>5, and Grey Star<ch.apos/>s <typ class="attribute">WILLPOWER</typ> points used as 2. If the number taken from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> is a 6, then the result of the first round of combat is:</p>
         <ul>
          <li>Grey Star loses 4 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points.</li>
          <li>Deathgaunt loses 5 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points, multiplied by 2 <typ class="attribute">WILLPOWER</typ> points, giving a total of 10 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points lost in all.</li>
         </ul>
        </li>
        <li><p>On the <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>, mark the changes in <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points to the participants in the combat, and Grey Star<ch.apos/>s amended <typ class="attribute">WILLPOWER</typ> points total.</p></li>
        <li><p>Unless otherwise instructed, or unless you have an option to evade, the next round of combat now starts.</p></li>
        <li><p>Repeat the sequence from <a idref="stage3">Stage 3</a>.</p></li>
       </ol>

       <p>This process of combat continues until the <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points of either the enemy or Grey Star are reduced to zero or below, at which point that combatant is declared dead. If Grey Star is dead, the adventure is over. If the enemy is dead, Grey Star proceeds but with his <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> and <typ class="attribute">WILLPOWER</typ> points possibly reduced.</p>

         <p>During your adventure you may be given the chance to evade combat If you have already engaged in a round of combat and decide to evade, calculate the combat for that round in the usual manner. All points lost by the enemy as a result of that round are ignored, and you make your escape.

       <p>The room is silent. Okosa, the Kundi king, his servants, and Urik, the old Shaman of the Kundi tribe, look on intently as you concentrate on the strange riddle. Suddenly, the solution crystallizes in your mind.</p>
       <blockquote>
        <p>
	 <thought><line>Wise Shianti and Kundi man,</line>
	 <line>Look eye to eye<ch.ellips/></line></thought>
	</p>
       </blockquote>
       <p>Of course! The eyes of the Shianti race have pupils like mirrored glass. Anyone looking into the eyes of a Shianti would see himself reflected there.</p>
       <blockquote>
        <p>
	 <thought><line>Shianti man see Kundi man</line>
	 <line>But what does Kundi see?</line></thought>
	</p>
       </blockquote>
       <p>The Kundi man would see <em>himself!</em></p>
       <p>You give your answer. At once, the tension in the atmosphere evaporates. The expressions on the faces of the assembled Kundi men change to a mixture of awe and respect, and Urik bows low. <quote>Welcome friend,</quote> he says, simply.</p>
       <p>King Okosa steps forward and grips your hand firmly. <quote>Forgive us,</quote> he says. <quote>These troubled times<ch.ellips/> Shadakine wear many disguises. Evil have many faces. We give all help to Shianti child now we know he speak truth.</quote></p>
       <p>You breathe a great sigh of relief, for without the aid of the Kundi your quest is doomed to failure. Only the eyes of a Kundi man are able to see the magical Shadow Gate, the door you must open before entering the realm of the Daziarn Plane where the Moonstone of the Shianti is hidden.</p>
       <p>The exhaustion and fatigue of your adventure on your way to the cloud forest floods through you like a great wave that washes through your tired limbs. Before you can speak your thanks, you fall into a faint.</p>
       <p>Through the haze of a dream, your senses pass from sleep to waking. Opening your eyes, you see the wrinkled face of Urik, gazing intently into your own. <quote>How<ch.ellips/> how long?</quote> you falter.</p>
       <p><quote>Three days. Three nights. Deep sleep have healing ways<ch.emdash/>is true?</quote> Urik replies. You sit up in the hammock that has been your resting place these past three days and look around. Bright sunlight streams in through the window of the wooden chamber. The events of the past weeks rush through your mind. With some surprise, you note that your body is unmarked after the horrors of your ordeal. Even the Mantiz bite on your leg has disappeared.</p>
       <p><quote>Kundi magic,</quote> Urik explains, mysteriously. Your tattered, grey robes, washed and repaired, are laid out for you, and when you have breakfasted on fresh <!--ERRTAG-RE-45701-->rainwater<!--/ERRTAG-RE-45701--> and honey cakes, you are led out to meet King Okosa once more. You marvel at the breathtaking beauty of the cloud forest that is the home of the Kundi people. Urik leads, shambling along with his comical, bow-legged walk and toothless smile and you cross the wooden walkways that connect the tree houses of the Kundi. They nestle amongst the highest branches of giant Azawood trees, whose towering heights and leafy peaks draw moisture from the clouds themselves: the wooden turrets of a forest castle surrounded by an ocean of cloud.</p>

       </illustration>
       <p>You are brought before the Kundi king once more. He and his advisers are gathered in the largest of the tree houses and old Urik ushers you in. <quote>You are well?</quote> the king asks. You nod your head and thank him and his people for treating you with such kindness.</p>
       <p><quote>Long ago,</quote> the king continues, <quote>before Wytch-king, Shasarak, rose in the north, the Shianti and Kundi tribes<ch.emdash/>great friends. Shianti need magical sight of Kundi to look into other worlds, see other planes. Only Shianti can go there. Only Kundi can see there<ch.ellips/> We help each other. Learn many things. But when Shianti leave, Wytch-king lead Shadakine peoples against us, burning the forests of our home in Mountains of Lara. Now, Shianti send great wizard to destroy evil Wytch-king, throw down Shadakine. Kundi men give all their help, in honour of our friendship. How we aid you?</quote></p>
       <p><quote>I must travel to the Daziarn plane and reclaim the Moonstone of old,</quote> you reply. <quote>My masters tell me that I must seek out the Shadow Gate, the doorway that is invisible to all but the eyes of the noble Kundi. I ask you for a guide to take me there.</quote></p>
       <p>The king creases his brow. <quote>Shadow Gate come and go; never in one place for long,</quote> says King Okosa. <quote>Kundi eyes must see far; make prophecy for next place Shadow Gate appear. Only the keenest eyes among us can help you. I will name your guide.</quote> You search amongst the faces of those present, wondering which of the brave Kundi men will be chosen. <quote>Grey Star, I give you Urik the Wise,</quote> says the king, with a gesture of the hand.</p>
       <p>You look with some surprise at Okosa<ch.apos/>s choice. Urik smiles back, a great toothless grin, and bows humbly. The Shaman looks far too old and frail to be able to face the likely dangers ahead, but without the <quote>sight</quote> of the ageing Shaman, your quest is hopeless. Perhaps, you think doubtfully, he has other talents?</p>
       <p><quote>Waste no time. Start now,</quote> Urik says. <quote>Urik find Shadow Gate. Wizard see some <em>Kundi</em> magic now!</quote> He flashes you a sly smile. Not for the first time, you get the feeling that Urik is mocking you with his jibes about magic and wizards, as if he knows some great secret that others do not.</p>
       <p><quote>I work a great spell,</quote> he announces to everyone, like an actor addressing an audience. <quote>Stand back! Give me room! I must find the Shadow Gate.</quote> A large circle forms and you watch Urik stride to the centre, his tail lashing and eyes glaring. You watch with some curiosity as he turns around and around, slowly at first, gradually increasing speed. He breathes deeply and often, hissing as he expels each breath from his lungs. Rags and feathers flutter and the tiny bells that he is wearing ring furiously. Soon, he is shouting and gibbering like a lunatic, arms waving in the air. You are barely able to suppress a snort of laughter but quickly check yourself, noticing that the Kundi look on with sombre expressions. Suddenly, Urik gives an ear-piercing scream, ceases his crazed, whirling dance and spins to the floor, where he collapses in a heap. Startled, you go to help him but feel a restraining hand on your arm. <quote>No,</quote> a young Kundi man whispers. <quote>It is the trance. The rite is over<ch.emdash/>the visions come.</quote></p>
       <p><quote>You mean there<ch.apos/>s more!</quote> you exclaim. Indeed, the show is not yet over. Urik has been silent for a short time, save for the panting of his protesting lungs. He sits up, straight-backed and stiff-limbed, his eyes wide and staring.</p>
       <p><quote>I see mountains!</quote> he moans. <quote>Black mountains! And beyond<ch.ellips/> a wide valley, dead land, ash and dust. Everywhere darkness, darkness and<ch.ellips/> I<ch.ellips/> I see it<ch.emdash/>the Shadow Gate<ch.emdash/>beneath the light of a full moon.</quote></p>
       <p>After heated discussion, all are agreed that the black mountains of Urik<ch.apos/>s vision must be the infamous Mountains of Morn, and the dead lands beyond, Desolation Valley, a wasted plain that lies on the other side of the mountains<ch.emdash/>the site of an ancient calamity. As Urik saw a full moon shining above the Shadow Gate, the Kundi are sure that it will appear somewhere in Desolation Valley at that time.</p>
       <p><quote>Already it is the time of the new moon,</quote> says King Okosa.</p>
       <p><quote>Two weeks,</quote> you breathe.</p>
       <p><quote>Two weeks, Grey Star,</quote> says the king, <quote>and two hundred miles of Shadakine country, difficult mountains, and unknown wilderness, lie <!--ERRTAG-RE-51012-->ahead. You<!--/ERRTAG-RE-51012--> have little time.</quote></p>
       <p><quote>What do you think, Urik?</quote> you say.</p>
       <p>Urik<ch.apos/>s ugly old face breaks into a knowing smile. <quote>Little time<ch.ellips/> much to do!</quote> he says, jovially. <quote>Urik have plan<ch.emdash/>cover many miles in just one day, leave Azanam far behind.</quote></p>
       <p><quote>But how?</quote> you ask. <quote>When?</quote></p>
       <p><quote>Great wizard must learn much patience,</quote> he replies. <quote>You will see. Be ready to leave tomorrow at first light.</quote> Urik will say no more and quickly leaves. You turn to the Kundi king. He merely shrugs his shoulders.</p>
       <p><quote>Ways of the wise are strange,</quote> he says, <quote>and who dare question the path of wisdom?</quote> he finishes, cryptically. Like many Kundi sayings, it is one that begs no answer. It seems you have no choice other than to wait until tomorrow<ch.apos/>s dawn to find out the Shaman<ch.apos/>s plan.</p>

       <p>Still within the vision, you point towards the Element of Air. It floats towards you and you feel it entering the domain of Earth. The use of this Magical Power has cost you 2 <typ class="attribute">WILLPOWER</typ> points.</p>
       <p>When you open your eyes, you see that the Shadakine have already reached the edge of the lake. Their leader shouts commands and they move into position, loading their weapons and preparing to fire. There is no sign of the Air Elementals.</p>
       <p>The Shadakine leader gives a shout and the Shadakine warriors release a volley of crossbow bolts in your direction. Instinctively, you and Urik dive to the ground. You are dismayed; it seems that the <!--ERRTAG-RE-55869-->Elementals<!--/ERRTAG-RE-55869--> have failed you. Then suddenly, a burst of astonished cries comes from the Shadakine as a colossal gust of wind tears past you. Looking up, you watch as the volley of quarrels is swept up and away by a whirlwind of dust and debris. The <!--ERRTAG-RE-56160-->Elemental<!--/ERRTAG-RE-56160--> stands, man-high before you, the faint outline of a pair of eyes shining up from within the depths of its form. It is a Whirlghast, and the bolts of the Shadakine are unable to pass through it.</p>
       <p><quote>Urik,</quote> you call, <quote>can we do anything about the Eijalfish?</quote> Another volley of bolts flies towards you, but they are spun in all directions by the Whirlghast. Urik produces a small boomerang from his tunic. Its edge is lined with a row of razor-sharp teeth. <quote>I try,</quote> he says.</p>
       <p>Taking careful aim, he throws the boomerang towards the eyestalks of the Eijalfish. His aim is true; the boomerang slices an eye from its stalk before returning to land at his feet. Green blood marks the spot where the Eijalfish once lingered. <quote>We go now?</quote> Urik asks, a mischievous grin on his face as he bends to pick up his weapon.</p>

Finally, the passage ends and a secret hatch opens on to the balcony of an ornate building. The balcony overlooks a vast hall where you witness a strange sight.</p>
       <p>An old man in tattered ermine robes sits upon a broken throne, surrounded by a bizarre gathering of people. Two guards in rusty armour stand either side of him as the ragged assembly of mad courtiers dances a stately pavane without music.

An unnatural howl sounds from somewhere behind you; it is the chilling call of the Magdi, the monstrous two-headed hounds created by the Wytch-king Shasarak.

Panting and gasping for breath, he hurls you to the safety of the river bank and slowly you crawl up the bank.

Half of the face is missing and, in its place, a metal plate gives shape to the ruined visage of wasted flesh and scarred tissue. One eye is shrunken and sightless, while the other burns with the intensity of the sun. A gaze of unbearable malice focuses on your heart. <quote>Desist, Wizard<ch.emdash/>or I will rend the very soul from your body.</quote></p>

The people of Taklakot grew in knowledge but it was a power gained without wisdom and a great calamity befell them.

       <p>That night, the streets of Karnali are filled with joyous celebration. The surviving Shadakine are flushed out from their bolt-holes and imprisoned in the dungeons beneath their own fortress. It is a great victory for the brave fighters of the Freedom Guild, for at last, after many years of oppression, the people in this small corner of the Shadakine Empire are free.</p>
       <p>In a chamber in the Shadakine fortress, you sit with Urik and Sado of the Long Knife, who toasts you with a huge goblet of wine. <quote>To you, Grey Star,</quote> he says, <quote>I give my thanks and good wishes. Long may you endure.</quote></p>

       <p>A crossbow bolt slices through the air. You gasp with pain as it penetrates your shoulder (lose 3 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points). Urik looks up in alarm. <quote>Grey Star!</quote> he shouts. <quote>You all right?</quote> You grit your teeth against the pain and nod. A dark stain of blood spreads across your robe. The Ooslo bird is losing height rapidly and, before the Shadakine are able to release another bolt, you are flying low enough to jump to the ground. At Urik<ch.apos/>s instruction you untie the vine, wincing with the pain of your wound, and fall to the ground without further injury.</p>
       <p>You tumble through a vast swathe of marsh grass that grows chest-high, and stretches in all directions. Urik gets to his feet and comes to inspect your wound. Bravely, you make to withdraw the shaft that protrudes from your shoulder but Urik stays your hand. <quote>No, not yet. Much bleeding if you pull the spike. We need herbs<ch.ellips/> stop bleeding<ch.ellips/> stop infection, yes?</quote> You nod in agreement. <quote>Come follow old Kundi. Find good herbs very near.</quote> He moves away, his eyes searching the ground, and you follow. Soon you reach a shallow waterway that cuts through the tall marsh grass like a trail. There, Urik finds what he is looking for and sits you down beside the little stream. <quote>Urik cannot find anything to stop pain but make sure wound heal. I must hurt you now<ch.emdash/>I am sorry.</quote></p>
       <p>With a hand both swift and sure, he pulls the bolt from your shoulder; you hiss with pain. He tears away the material of your sleeve and presses his steady hand to the wound. Then, cupping his hand, he takes some water from the stream and cleans the wound. Next, to your surprise, he grabs a handful of mud from the bottom of the stream and smears it over the injury. The cool mud eases the fire in your shoulder and, as it dries, quickly staunches the bleeding. He cleans the torn shreds of your sleeve and knots them like a bandage around your shoulder. <quote>Is good?</quote> he asks.</p>
       <p><quote>I thank you, Urik,</quote> you reply. He pats your hand, affectionately.</p>
       <p><quote>No need for thanks,</quote> he says. <quote>Wise old Kundi know healing ways. Pain stop soon.</quote></p>
       <p>Suddenly, a terrible sound reaches your ears: a moaning howl like that of an animal in pain. Urik<ch.apos/>s face darkens and he helps you to your feet. Crouching, so that you remain hidden, you both peep across the top of the marsh grass in the direction of the sound. In a small clearing, some two hundred yards away, you see a frightened peasant<ch.emdash/>a Shadakine slave. He is struggling to control two snarling hounds who tug at the lengths of thick chain fixed to their harnesses. They are huge and fierce: each has two heads with a single horn growing at the centre of each, and <!--ERRTAG-RE-180230-->outsized<!--/ERRTAG-RE-180230--> fangs show through their slavering jowls. <quote>Master!

       <p>Hardly daring to breathe, you and Urik remain crouched within the dense marsh grass. A Shadakine warrior pauses to look around only a few yards from your hiding place. He takes a step towards you, then gives a startled cry as he sinks into the quicksand which once held you. His cries for help alert a number of his fellow warriors who come to his aid, hurling jeers and insults at his apparent stupidity.</p>
       <p>Urik gives a satisfied nod and gestures for you to follow him. With quiet, tentative steps, you move away from the clamour of the Shadakine warriors, exploiting this unexpected distraction to the full. When Urik is satisfied that you have placed a sufficient distance between you and your enemy, he motions for you to sit down. With sure hands he breaks the quarrel that is embedded in your shoulder. <quote>Make no sound,</quote> whispers Urik, before pulling the bolt. You grit your teeth as he tugs at the shaft and <quote>swallow</quote> the pain. A shallow stream trickles close by and he uses its waters to clean the wound. <quote>There is good medicine here,</quote> he says, plunging his hand into the stream and withdrawing a fistful of mud, which he daubs liberally over your injury. The mud feels cool against the throbbing pain of your shoulder <!--ERRTAG-RE-193971-->and, as<!--/ERRTAG-RE-193971--> it dries, it staunches the bleeding. You thank Urik for his aid.</p>
       <p>Suddenly a chilling howl reaches your ears, sending a shiver of fear down your spine. Cautiously, Urik rises to peer along the tops of the chest-high marsh grass, searching for the source of the howl. He quickly ducks his head and turns to speak, a worried look on his face. He tells you that the Shadakine have hunting dogs and are preparing to release them. They are the Magdi: ferocious hounds with two heads<ch.emdash/>the creation of the Wytch-king Shasarak.</p>

Hugi manages to wriggle free from the coils of the beast and, as he rolls clear, you bring your Staff down with a mighty blow.

       <p>Casting your mind back, you recall seeing a proliferation of Mustow pods growing in the Gurlu Marshes. These strange, fungal growths are renowned for their pungent odour when broken open. At your command, a large number of these are brought to you by some of Sado<ch.apos/>s followers. You order that the Mustow pods be hurled over the walls of the fortress in large numbers, and soon many Shadakine can be seen pouring out of their barracks, eyes streaming, as the Mustow pods explode within the fortress, emitting great clouds of foul-smelling gas. The gates are thrown open and a horde of Shadakine spill into the street where Sado<ch.apos/>s army, disguised as civilians, lies in wait.</p>

       <p>You brace yourself for combat but the man in the shadows quickly sheathes his sword and steps out of the darkness. It is Samu, the ebony giant you saved from the mind grip of the slavemaster. He strides towards you, hand outstretched in a gesture of greeting. <quote>You are leaving Karnali?</quote> he asks.</p>
       <p><quote>I must,</quote> you say, solemnly. <quote>I must reach Desolation Valley beyond the Mountains of Morn before the turning of the next full moon.</quote></p>
       <p>Samu raises his eyebrows in surprise. <quote>You are going into the dead lands?</quote> he asks. <quote>None has ever returned from there: you will perish for sure.</quote></p>
       <p><quote>I have to try, or die in the attempt. There<ch.apos/>s too much at stake.</quote> You briefly describe the nature of your quest and its ultimate goal: to throw down the Wytch-king and all his works.</p>
       <p>Samu is silent for a while, deep in thought. Once, he was a proud king, the ruler of a nomadic people called the <!--ERRTAG-RE-245937-->Masbat<ch.eacute/><!--/ERRTAG-RE-245937-->, a warrior nation that dwelt upon the rolling savannah of the Great <!--ERRTAG-RE-246059-->Lissan<!--/ERRTAG-RE-246059--> Plain. Of his brave people, only he remains, the sole survivor of the depredations of the Wytch-king of Shadaki, riven of his family, his nation, and of hope by the cruelty of an inhuman tyrant. With smouldering eyes that hint at his bitter loss, he looks down on you. <quote>I will come with you, I think,</quote> he says. <quote>You will have need of my strength to partner your bravery.</quote></p>
       <p>You thread your way among the dark, deserted streets of Karnali and leave by the west gate. With a man such as this by your side, how can you fail?</p>

A large wound oozes blood from its side. Urik explains that it is a young Chaksu, a much sought after beast. The adult grows to as much as ten feet in height and Chaksu hide is an expensive commodity, much in demand due to its toughness and elasticity. It is said that the wealth of the city of Karnali that stands on the edge of the Gurlu Marshes was built upon its trade in Chaksu hides and hunters frequently come to the marshes in search of their fortune.</p>

Only our fear that the citizens of Karnali would be punished for our<!--ERRTAG-RE-282018--> actions prevents<!--/ERRTAG-RE-282018--> us from rising up within the city walls. And,</quote> he shrugs, <quote>our numbers are small while the Shadakine maintain a heavy garrison. But what of you?</quote></p>
       <p>A thin man comes and begins to clear away your plates and empty wine goblets. He brushes past you and, to your amazement, attempts to pick your pocket. <!--ERRTAG-RE-282421--><quote>You, man!</quote> <!--/ERRTAG-RE-282421-->shouts <!--ERRTAG-RE-282493-->Sado, <quote>What<!--/ERRTAG-RE-282493--> do you think you<ch.apos/>re doing?

       <p>He turns and apologizes to you, explaining that the bulk of his army is recruited from the criminal ranks of the city. You explain your quest and the land that you seek. Sado<ch.apos/>s eyes widen with astonishment. <quote>Then the legends are true?</quote> he gapes. <quote>The Shianti still exist!</quote></p>
       <p>You nod. <quote>If my quest should finally succeed and I retrieve the Moonstone, the full might of their wisdom and magic will be turned against Shasarak,</quote> you tell him.</p>
       <p><quote>How the people would rejoice to know that a Shianti walked among us once more,</quote> says Sado, <quote>though I understand the need for secrecy. Nevertheless,</quote> he continues, his eyes lighting up, <quote>I would ask a boon of you. Tonight, we attempt our most daring stratagem against the corrupt rule of the Shadakine. Stand with us in battle tonight; aid us if you will. With the might of a Shianti Wizard in our ranks, who knows what we could achieve! Help the Freedom Guild, Grey Star, in our struggle to free the people of Karnali.</quote></p>
       <p>He looks, a searching gaze on his face, with an intensity that almost crackles with energy.</p>

       <p>You soon realize that Urik<ch.apos/>s eccentric, shambling gait is not due to senility, but is one that he has adapted to suit his environment: his bow legs, the rolling rhythm of his stride, and his long tail enable him to trot along the narrowest of branches with ease. Meanwhile, you are left tottering along, your back bent in a curious balancing act, and your eyes averted from the ground, far below.</p>
       <p>By mid-morning, you have reached the edge of the rain forest of the Azanam and are overlooking the Azagad Gorge. Far below, you can make out the sharp pinnacles of rock known as the <quote>Dragon<ch.apos/>s Teeth</quote> which cover the canyon floor. It was through this gorge that you came in search of the Azanam, and the lost Kundi tribe. There it was that your friend and guide, Shan Li the merchant, died so terribly, devoured by poisonous Quoku, the flying amphibians that inhabit the desolate land. Your silent reverie is interrupted by the sound of Urik calling to you from above. <quote>Azagad hold sad memories for Grey Star?</quote> he enquires sympathetically. You nod your head, not thinking to ask how he knew what was on your mind. <quote>No time for sorrow now<ch.ellips/> time fly! Catch.</quote> He throws you a length of vine cut from the tree on which he stands. You take up the creeper and look at it in puzzlement. <quote>Make yourself a harness and tie it on<ch.emdash/>good and tight,</quote> he orders. You do as he suggests and before you can question his purpose, he produces a carved flute. He places it to his lips and begins to play a strange melody quite unlike any music you have ever heard before.</p>
       <p>The music lasts for some time. Eventually, Urik puts down his pipe and looks expectantly at the sky. <quote>What now?</quote> you ask, a hint of cynicism in your voice.</p>
       <p><quote>Look<ch.ellips/> see!</quote> he replies. Far away you can see a tiny speck on the skyline. <quote>Ooslo bird<ch.ellips/> love Kundi music.</quote> The dark speck grows larger and soon you are able to make out the awkward, disproportionate shape of an Ooslo bird. Long-necked and small bodied, the bird<ch.apos/>s great wings flap without rhythm or grace. It is a strange creature.</p>

       </illustration>
       <p>As the bird draws nearer, Urik takes up his pipe once more and plays. Eventually, the bird settles on a nearby branch, craning its neck and twisting its head, an expression of rapt fascination in its big, saucer-like eyes. Urik ties the other end of vine into a lasso. He stops playing and, with amazing accuracy, throws the lasso over the Ooslo<ch.apos/>s head. As the loop of the vine falls and tightens around the bird<ch.apos/>s neck, it gives a squawk of alarm. Only now does the nature of Urik<ch.apos/>s plan to <quote>cover many miles in just one <!--ERRTAG-RE-291628-->day</quote> dawn<!--/ERRTAG-RE-291628--> on you.</p>
       <p>Suddenly, you are dragged up into the air by the Ooslo bird. Urik gives an excited whoop of delight, leaping into the air and grabbing at your legs, dangling there as the bird flies higher. <quote>What do we do now?</quote> you shout, swinging wildly in the air, the old Kundi man clinging to your legs and grinning maniacally.</p>
       <p><quote>Ooslo bird fly home now<ch.ellips/> back to Gurlu Marshes. Ooslo<ch.emdash/>strong flier. Take us far<ch.ellips/> and good fun, eh?</quote> The Ooslo bird squawks loudly and Urik hoots back with a howl of wild laughter.</p>
       <p>Despite the discomfort of the vine that chafes under your arms and the dizzying heights of your aerial journey away from the Azanam, you finally admit to yourself that Urik<ch.apos/>s dangerous and eccentric plan has saved you many miles of walking and perhaps days of wandering. Far below, the landscape rushes by and by late afternoon the scenery has completely changed. Ahead lie the marshy wastes of the Gurlu Swamplands, the nesting place of the Ooslo bird.</p>
       <p>The Ooslo bird begins to fly lower, its voluminous wings flapping erratically as it checks its speed. You are wondering how you are to land safely when Urik shouts up to you. He is pointing ahead. <quote>Big trouble. Hunters,</quote> he says. Sure enough, you can see a party of men armed with crossbows. With horror, you recognize the party to be comprised of Shadakine warriors, soldier slaves of the Wytch-king, Shasarak. It is evident that you have been spotted, as the warriors are running this way and that, shouting and busily priming their weapons. The ground speeds by over twenty feet below.</p>

       <p><quote>There must be another way out,</quote> says Hugi, calmly, as if he has all the time in the world. He begins to run his hands along the walls of the small room, knocking with his knuckle against the smooth stone. Then he hears a hollow tone. <quote>Here!</quote> he exclaims.</p>
       <p>A wooden panel falls away in Hugi<ch.apos/>s hand to reveal the latch of a hidden door. It is locked but Hugi produces a wallet full of small knives and pieces of wire and selects a length of fine copper with which to pick the lock. <quote>Hurry!</quote> says Samu. <quote>This door will not hold.</quote></p>
       <p>Skilfully, Hugi opens the door to reveal a passage leading downwards. You run down into its darkness, little knowing what lies ahead.</p>

       <p>The following day, you, Urik, and the fighters of the Freedom Guild are ensconced in the tall grass at the edge of the marsh. In the distance gleams the city of Karnali overlooking the Suhni and Belzar Rivers. Along the Great Suhn Road that leads east away from Karnali, you see a long line of men, women, and children: slaves of the Shadakine. Warriors walk up and down the line, brandishing flails with needless ferocity. Suddenly, the charge is sounded and a wave of men pours out of the brush and runs towards the column of slaves.</p>

       <p><quote>Grey Star!</quote> Urik shouts. <quote>Come away<ch.ellips/> the bridge!</quote> Heedless of its fragile state, you walk slowly from the bridge, too numb to speak. Without looking back, the three of you walk towards the gate of the Forbidden City in silence.</p>

       <p>Taking a deep breath, you plunge into the water. Urik follows directly after.

       <p>Freed of the encumbrance of your Backpack, you kick out and soon reach the edge of the lake. You break the surface, gulping at the air as you scramble away from the flame.

       <p>Injured and exhausted, you throw yourself into the haven of tall marsh grass. Urik staggers to your side, water cascading from his sodden clothes.

       <p>With a gesture of his ruined hand, he shows you the vision of a young girl, sobbing, surrounded by a pool of darkness. With a dull ache in your heart you recognize the girl. It is Tanith, the Wytch girl who helped you escape from a Shadakine prison in the Port of Suhn and finally leapt to her death to save you. Now, trapped upon another plane, she weeps alone, her eyes wild with fear. <quote>Tanith!</quote> you call into the void of your dream.</p>

You have lost 1 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> point and 1 <typ class="attribute">WILLPOWER</typ> point during the night.</p>
       <p>In the grey light of dawn you trudge towards the Forbidden City, your companions walking silently by your side. Soon, you are able to see the outline of the city in the distance. A few more hours and you will be standing before its gates. There is only one solution to the sinking of your heart and the mounting ache that racks your mind: you must complete your quest.</p>
