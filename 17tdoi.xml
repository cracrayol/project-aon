   <p>You are Lone Wolf<ch.emdash/>Kai Grand Master of Sommerlund. Far away to the west lies the peninsula of Ixia. It is an icy, desolate wasteland that for 10,000 years has been the domain of Lord Ixiataaga<ch.emdash/>Masterlord of the Dead. Here he reigns supreme over a horde of lost souls, an undead populace who are condemned to an eternity in his service.</p>
   <p>In <cite>The Deathlord of Ixia</cite>, you must journey to the forbidden city of Xaagon<ch.emdash/>the seat of Lord Ixiataaga<ch.apos/>s dark power<ch.emdash/>and confront him in a life-or-death battle which will test your Grand Master abilities to the limit. Will you overcome and defeat this terrifying entity? Or will you fall victim to his undead legions and the terrible new power they wield?</p>

      <p>There is some confusion around the use of the term <quote>Old Kingdom</quote> in this book. Although the native Ixians are often described as belonging to the <quote>time of the Old Kingdoms</quote> (<a idref="sect152">Section 152</a>), it is clear from the fact that the Deathlord destroyed them during the Age of Eternal Night that they could not have existed during the Age of the Old Kingdoms which began more than 1000 years after the Age of Eternal Night ended. (See <cite><a href="&link.tmc;">The Magnamund Companion</a></cite>, <quote>Magnamund Then and Now</quote>.) The author may have used the term <quote>Old Kingdom</quote> to refer to any humanoid nation prior to the appearance of the Shianti.</p>

     <p>You are Grand Master Lone Wolf, last of the Kai Lords of Sommerlund and sole survivor of a massacre that wiped out the First Order of your <!--ERRTAG-RE-5555--><ch.eacute/>lite<!--/ERRTAG-RE-5555--> warrior caste.</p>
     <p>It is the year MS 5077, twenty-seven years since your brave kinsmen perished at the hands of the Darklords of Helgedad. These champions of evil, who were sent forth by <!--ERRTAG-RE-6583-->Naar, the King<!--/ERRTAG-RE-6583--> of the Darkness, to destroy the fertile world of Magnamund, have themselves since been destroyed. You vowed to avenge the murder of the Kai and you kept your pledge, for it was you who brought about their downfall when alone you infiltrated their foul domain<ch.emdash/>the Darklands<ch.emdash/>and caused the destruction of their leader and the seat of his power that was the infernal city of Helgedad.</p>
     <p>In the wake of their destruction, chaos befell the Darkland armies who, until then, had been poised to conquer all of Magnamund. Some factions which comprised this huge army, most notably the barbaric Drakkarim, began to fight with the others for control. This disorder quickly escalated into an all-out civil war which allowed the <!--ERRTAG-RA-6514-->Freeland<!--/ERRTAG-RA-6514--> armies of Magnamund time in which to recover and launch a counter-offensive. Their commanders exploited the chaos skilfully and secured a swift and total victory over an enemy far superior in numbers.</p>
     <p>For seven years now peace has reigned in Sommerlund. Under your direction the once-ruined Monastery of the Kai has been thoroughly rebuilt and restored to its former glory, and the task of teaching a Second Order of Kai warriors the skills and proud traditions of your ancestors is also well established. The new generation of Kai recruits, all of whom were born during the era of war against the Darklords, possess latent Kai skills and show exceptional promise. These skills will be nurtured and honed to perfection during their time at the monastery so that they may teach and inspire future generations, thereby ensuring the continued security of your homeland in future years.</p>
     <p>Your attainment of the rank of Kai Grand Master brought with it great rewards. Some, such as the restoration of the Kai and the undying gratitude of your fellow Sommlending, could have been anticipated. Yet there have also been rewards which you could not possibly have foreseen. The discovery that within you lay the potential to develop Kai Disciplines beyond those of the Magnakai, which, until now, were thought to be the ultimate that a Kai Master could aspire to, was truly a revelation. Your discovery has inspired you to set out upon a new and previously unknown path in search of the wisdom and power that no Kai Lord before you has ever possessed. In the name of your creator, the God Kai, and for the greater glory of Sommerlund and the Goddess Ishir, you have vowed to reach the very pinnacle of Kai perfection<ch.emdash/>to attain all of the Grand Master Disciplines and become the first Kai Supreme Master.</p>
     <p>With diligence and determination you set about the restoration of the Kai Monastery and the training of the Second Order recruits. Your efforts were soon rewarded for within the space of two short years, the first raw recruits had graduated to become a cadre of gifted Kai Masters who, in turn, were able to commence the teaching of their skills to subsequent intakes of Kai novices. The Kai Masters rose to their newfound responsibilities readily, leaving you free to devote more of your time to the pursuit and perfection of the Grand Master Disciplines. During this period you also received expert tutelage in the ways of magic from two of your most trusted friends and advisors: Guildmaster Banedon, leader of the Brotherhood of the Crystal Star, and Lord Rimoah, speaker for the High Council of the Elder Magi.</p>
     <p>In the deepest subterranean level of the monastery, a hundred feet below the Tower of the Sun, you ordered the excavation and construction of a special vault. In this magnificent chamber wrought of granite and gold you placed the seven Lorestones of Nyxator, the gems of Kai power which you had recovered during your quest for the Magnakai. It was here, bathed in the golden light of those radiant gems, that you spent countless hours in pursuit of perfection. Sometimes alone, sometimes in the company of your two able advisors<ch.emdash/>Banedon and Rimoah<ch.emdash/>you worked hard to develop your innate <!--ERRTAG-RE-12767-->Grand Master Disciplines and grasp<!--/ERRTAG-RE-12767--> the fundamental secrets of Left-handed and Old Kingdom magic. During this time you noticed many remarkable changes taking place within your body: you became physically and mentally stronger, your five primary senses sharpened beyond all that you had experienced before, and, perhaps most remarkably, your body began to age at a much slower rate. Now, for every five years that elapse you age but one year.</p>
     <p>At this time many changes were occurring beyond the borders of Sommerlund. In the regions to the northeast of Magador and the Maakengorge, the Elder Magi of Dessi and the Herbwardens of Bautar were working together in an effort to restore the dusty volcanic wasteland to its former fertile state. It was the first tentative step towards the reclamation of all the Darklands. However, their progress was painfully slow, and both parties were resigned to the fact that their efforts to undo the damage caused by the Darklords would take centuries to complete.</p>
     <p>Elsewhere, throughout Northern Magnamund, peace reigns victorious and the peoples of the Free Kingdoms rejoice in the knowledge that the age of the Darklords has finally come to an end. Readily men have exchanged their swords for hoes and their shields for ploughs, and now the only marching they do is along the ruts of their freshly furrowed fields. Few are the watchful eyes that scan the distant horizon in fear of what may appear, although there are still those who maintain their vigilance, for the agents of Naar come in many guises and there are those upon Magnamund who wait quietly in the shadows for the chance to do his evil bidding.</p>
     <p>Already your newfound skills have been tested against Naar<ch.apos/>s agents and you have, on each occasion, acquitted yourself admirably. But your continuing victories against his minions have enraged the Dark God and inflamed his lust for vengeance. Earlier this year you thwarted Naar<ch.apos/>s plans to revive Vashna, the greatest of all the Darklords, whose spirit is trapped deep within the fathomless reaches of the Maakengorge<ch.emdash/>the <!--ERRTAG-RE-12102-->Chasm of Doom<!--/ERRTAG-RE-12102-->. Vashna<ch.apos/>s spirit has remained there in uneasy entombment ever since the day, long ago, when he and his army were defeated in battle by King Ulnar I of Sommerlund. Your brave and courageous actions prevented Naar<ch.apos/>s agents from summoning to Magnamund a demoness named Shamath from the Plane of Darkness. This supernatural creature possessed the Deathstaff<ch.emdash/>an artefact of great evil forged by Naar himself<ch.emdash/>with which she could have resurrected Vashna and his army from the Maakengorge. Yet your timely intervention destroyed the <!--ERRTAG-RA-12477-->Shadow Gate<!--/ERRTAG-RA-12477--> through which she was travelling, and by so doing, you imprisoned the demoness Shamath in the limbo which exists between your world and the Plane of Darkness.</p>
     <p>Confident in the belief that you had saved Magnamund from the demoness and the Deathstaff, you returned triumphantly to Sommerlund. Several months later, however, as the year was drawing to a close, Lord Rimoah came unexpectedly to the Kai Monastery seeking an urgent audience. With growing dismay you listened as he relayed ill news<ch.emdash/>the Deathstaff had reappeared in Magnamund. The threat to the peace of your fragile world was greater now than ever before.</p>
     <p><quote>When you destroyed the <!--ERRTAG-RA-12477-->Shadow Gate<!--/ERRTAG-RA-12477--> at Maakengorge, Grand Master,</quote> said Lord Rimoah, as the two of you discussed the matter in the secure privacy of your vault below the Kai Monastery, <quote>you banished Shamath to the void, hopefully for all eternity. Yet, alas, the weapon she possessed did not go with her. Naar<ch.apos/>s accursed Deathstaff has since returned to this world through another <!--ERRTAG-RA-12477-->Shadow Gate<!--/ERRTAG-RA-12477-->, one that lies far away to the west, on a remote and icy peninsula that is called Ixia.</quote></p>
     <p><quote>My lord, do you wish me to go to Ixia<ch.emdash/>to find and destroy the Deathstaff before another of Naar<ch.apos/>s agents can use it against us? Is this why you have come seeking my help?</quote> you replied, expecting Rimoah to affirm your assumption.</p>
     <p><quote>Partly so, my lord,</quote> he said, holding you with his steel-grey eyes, <quote>but I fear that already it has fallen into the hands of an enemy<ch.emdash/>and one who is deadlier than even the demoness Shamath. What do you know of the Deathlord of Ixia?</quote></p>
     <p>You faintly remembered having heard this name before but were unable to recall any detail. Lord Rimoah, seeing that you were unable to give an answer, obliged with an impromptu history lesson:</p>
     <p><quote>The Deathlord of Ixia was once lieutenant to Agarash the Damned<ch.emdash/>the most powerful of all Naar<ch.apos/>s champions of evil,</quote> said Rimoah, his head bowed as he paced the granite floor of your vault. <quote>During the Age of Eternal Night he conquered much of Northern Magnamund, including the realm of Ixia which was once a rich and very fertile land. He destroyed the native Ixians, transforming them into a legion of undead servants under his command.<footref id="tssf-1" idref="tssf-1-foot"/> Many centuries later, when my ancestors defeated Agarash during the <!--ERRTAG-RE-17262-->Age of War<!--/ERRTAG-RE-17262-->, they magically imprisoned the weakened Deathlord in a secret tomb within the dread city of Xaagon, near to the southern coast of Ixia. For thousands of years his tomb lay undisturbed until the first of the Drakkarim appeared on Magnamund. They entered Xaagon and found the Deathlord<ch.apos/>s tomb<ch.emdash/>yet legend has it that none of them escaped Ixia alive. Perhaps they, too, serve him now. During the Age of the Black Moon, the Darklords conquered all of the territories surrounding Ixia yet they chose to avoid setting foot in the Deathlord<ch.apos/>s realm. Mindful of his origins, they feared that if he were released from his sorcerous prison he would seek to dominate and destroy them.</quote></p>
     <p><quote>My lord, are you telling me that the Deathlord of Ixia is now free of this prison <em>and</em> in possession of the Deathstaff?</quote> you asked, fearing Lord Rimoah<ch.apos/>s reply.</p>
     <p><quote>Yes, Grand Master. I<ch.apos/>m afraid that is exactly the situation which confronts us. Since the passing of the last moon, I and others of the High Council of the Elder Magi have detected a great imbalance between the forces of Good and Evil in our world. By ill chance or by Naar<ch.apos/>s design, the Deathstaff has fallen into the hands of Ixiataaga. Once again the Deathlord is free to indulge his unholy and insatiable appetite for living beings. Already we have heard reports from Lencian fishermen which tell of the destruction of remote Drakkarim settlements around the Gulf of Konkor, and there are even claims of a <ch.apos/>death fleet<ch.apos/> having been sighted in the waters of the Shakoz Bight. Yes, Grand Master, the Deathlord is free to roam the face of Magnamund once more, and I fear he will not stop until every living creature is enslaved to him in undeath.</quote></p>
     <p>For hours, you and your trusted advisor deliberated over what could be done to prevent this unspeakable disaster from befalling Magnamund. You considered a muster of the <!--ERRTAG-RA-6514-->Freeland<!--/ERRTAG-RA-6514--> armies and an immediate attack upon Ixia, but such a plan simply could not be executed. The peninsula of Ixia is far too remote and desolate a territory to be reached by any <!--ERRTAG-RA-6514-->Freeland<!--/ERRTAG-RA-6514--> army on foot, and, with winter already so far advanced, any ship-borne invasion would be doomed to fail. Time was also against you. The Deathlord had to be stopped as quickly as possible before he could unleash an army of undead upon Magnamund, an unkillable army that would grow larger with every battle it fought against the living.</p>
     <p><quote>Only I can stop this,</quote> you said, voicing your thoughts.</p>
     <p><quote>Yes, Grand Master. Only you,</quote> replied Rimoah quietly.</p>
     <p>After a few moments<ch.apos/> silence, Rimoah continued, <quote>In expectation of your decision, preparations have already been made for your journey, Grand Master. I trust this doesn<ch.apos/>t offend you?</quote></p>
     <p>You smiled your consent.</p>
     <p><quote>Good. Then I shall call upon Guildmaster Banedon<ch.emdash/>he knows of the Deathlord<ch.apos/>s rise and he has offered his ship <cite>Skyrider</cite> to hasten your journey westwards. He will tell you more about Ixia and how you will be conveyed there. Godspeed, Grand Master. I shall pray to Kai and Ishir to watch over you on this fateful mission.</quote></p>

    <data>
     <p>You keep a record of your adventure on the <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
     <p>For more than six years, ever since the demise of the Darklords of Helgedad, you have devoted yourself to developing further your fighting prowess<ch.emdash/><typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ><ch.emdash/>and physical stamina<ch.emdash/><typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ>. Before you begin your first Grand Master adventure you need to measure how effective your training has been. To do this take a pencil and, with your eyes closed, point with the blunt end of it on to the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a>. If you pick a 0 it counts as zero.</p>
     <p>The first number that you pick from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> in this way represents your <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ>. Add 25 to the number you picked and write the total in the <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> section of your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a> (i.e., if your pencil fell on the number 6 in the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> you would write in a <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> of 31). When you fight, your <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> will be pitted against that of your enemy. A high score in this section is therefore very desirable.</p>
     <p>The second number that you pick from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> represents your powers of <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ>. Add 30 to this number and write the total in the <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> section of your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a> (i.e., if your pencil fell on the number 7 on the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> you would have 37 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points).</p>
     <p>If you are wounded in combat you will lose <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points. If at any time your <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points fall to zero or below, you are dead and the adventure is over. Lost <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points can be regained during the course of the adventure, but your number of <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points can never rise above the number you have when you start an adventure.</p>
     <p>If you have successfully completed any of the previous adventures in the <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> series (Books 1<ch.endash/>16), you can carry your current scores of <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> and <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points over to Book 17. These scores may include Weaponmastery, Curing, and Psi-surge bonuses obtained upon completion of <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> Kai (Books 1<ch.endash/>5) or Magnakai (Books 6<ch.endash/>12) adventures.<footref id="gamerulz-1" idref="gamerulz-1-foot"/> Only if you have completed these previous adventures will you benefit from the appropriate bonuses in the course of the Grand Master series. You may also carry over any Weapons and Backpack Items you had in your possession at the end of your last adventure, and these should be entered on your new Grand Master <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>. (You are still limited to two Weapons, but you may now carry up to ten Backpack Items.)</p>
     <p>However, only the following Special Items may be carried over from the <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> Kai (Books 1<ch.endash/>5) and Magnakai (Books 6<ch.endash/>12) series to the <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> Grand Master series (Books 13<ch.endash/>onwards):<footref id="gamerulz-2" idref="gamerulz-2-foot"/></p>

       <p>Now, through the pursuit of your new skills and the further development of your innate Kai abilities, you have set out upon a path of discovery that no other Kai Grand Master has ever attempted with success. Your determination to become the first Kai Supreme Master, by acquiring total proficiency in all twelve of the Grand Master Disciplines, is an awe-inspiring challenge. You will be venturing into the unknown, pushing back the boundaries of human limitation in the pursuit of greatness and the cause of Good. May the blessings of the <!--ERRTAG-RE-27110-->Gods Kai and Ishir<!--/ERRTAG-RE-27110--> go with you as you begin your brave and noble quest.</p>
       <p>In the years following the demise of the Darklords you have reached the rank of Kai Grand Defender, which means that you have mastered <em>four</em> of the Grand Master Disciplines listed below. It is up to you to choose which four Disciplines these are. As all of the Grand Master Disciplines will be of use to you at some point during your adventure, pick your four skills with care. The correct use of a Grand Master Discipline at the right time could save your life.</p>
       <p>When you have chosen your four Disciplines, enter them in the Grand Master Disciplines section of your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>.</p>

       <p>There will be occasions during your adventure when you have to fight an enemy. The enemy<ch.apos/>s <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> and <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points are given in the text. Lone Wolf<ch.apos/>s aim in the combat is to kill the enemy by reducing his <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points to zero while losing as few <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points as possible himself.</p>
       <p>At the start of a combat, enter Lone Wolf<ch.apos/>s and the enemy<ch.apos/>s <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points in the appropriate boxes on the Combat Record section of your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>. The sequence for combat is as follows:</p>
       <ol class="paragraphed">
        <li><p>Add any extra points gained through your Grand Master Disciplines and Special Items to your current <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> total.</p></li>
        <li>
         <p>Subtract the <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> of your enemy from this total. The result is your Combat Ratio. Enter it on the <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
         <p>Example</p>
         <p>Lone Wolf (<typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> 27) is attacked by a pack of Doomwolves (<typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> 30). He is taken by surprise and is not given the opportunity of evading their attack. Lone Wolf has the Grand Master Discipline of Kai-surge to which the Doomwolves are not immune, so Lone Wolf adds 8 points to his <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ>, giving him a total <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> of 35.</p>
         <p>He subtracts the Doomwolf pack<ch.apos/>s <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> from his own, giving a Combat Ratio of +5. (35<ch.minus/>30 = +5). +5 is noted on the <a idref="action">Action Chart</a> as the Combat Ratio.</p>
        </li>
        <li><p><a id="stage3">When you have your Combat Ratio</a>, pick a number from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a>.</p></li>
        <li>
         <p>Turn to the <a idref="crtable">Combat Results Table</a>. Along the top of the chart are shown the Combat Ratio numbers. Find the number that is the same as your Combat Ratio and cross-reference it with the random number that you have picked (the random numbers appear on the side of the chart). You now have the number of <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points lost by both Lone Wolf and his enemy in this round of combat. (E represents points lost by the enemy; LW represents points lost by Lone Wolf.)</p>
         <p>Example</p>
         <p>The Combat Ratio between Lone Wolf and the Doomwolf Pack has been established as +5. If the number picked from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> is a 2, then the result of the first round of combat is:</p>
         <ul>
          <li>Lone Wolf loses 3 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points (plus an additional 1 point for using Kai-surge).</li>
          <li>Doomwolf Pack loses 7 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points.</li>
         </ul>
        </li>
        <li><p>On the <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>, mark the changes in <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points to the participants in the combat.</p></li>
        <li><p>Unless otherwise instructed, or unless you have an option to evade, the next round of combat now starts.</p></li>
        <li><p>Repeat the sequence from <a idref="stage3">Stage 3.</a></p></li>
       </ol>

       <p>This process of combat continues until <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points of either the enemy or Lone Wolf are reduced to zero or below, at which point that combatant is declared dead. If Lone Wolf is dead, the adventure is over. If the enemy is dead, Lone Wolf proceeds but with his <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points possibly reduced.</p>

         <p>During your adventure you may be given the chance to evade combat.

All points lost by the enemy as a result of that round are ignored, and you make your escape. Only Lone Wolf may lose <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points during that round (but then that is the risk of running away!). You may evade only if the text of the particular section allows you to do so.</p>

This ability cannot be used with a wholly wooden weapon such as a quarterstaff.</p></dd>
          <dt>Assimilance</dt>
           <dd><p>Sun Lords who possess this skill are able to cause the outline of their bodies to become blurred and indistinct. By so doing, they can greatly increase their chances of avoiding magical and/or non-magical missiles directed at them.</p></dd>

           <dd><p>Sun Lords who possess mastery of this Discipline are able to launch a Kai-blast<ch.emdash/>a pulse of intense psychic energy which is capable of affecting both psychically active and inactive enemies. This form of psychic attack is very effective, more so than a usual Kai-surge, Psi-surge, or Mindblast. It can cause an enemy to lose between 2 and 18 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points in one attack. A Kai Sun Lord using Kai-blast determines the damage inflicted on an enemy by picking two numbers from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a>. These numbers should be added together (a <quote>0</quote> = 1) and the resultant total equals the damage inflicted. However, use of a Kai-blast will reduce a Sun Lord<ch.apos/>s <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points total by 4.

       <p>Lord Rimoah removes a sphere of crystal from a pocket of his robe and holds it up to the lantern light. It is filled with a swirling grey mist. Softly he murmurs the words of an ancient spell and the mist clears to reveal the anxious face of your friend<ch.emdash/>Guildmaster Banedon. Rimoah speaks briefly to Banedon<ch.apos/>s image, requesting that he come to the Monastery at once.</p>
       <p><thought>I will be with you within the hour,</thought> says the voice of Banedon, a whisper in your mind.</p>
       <p>Your friend is in Toran, sixty miles to the north, yet he holds true to his word. In less than an hour he arrives at the Monastery aboard <cite>Skyrider</cite><ch.emdash/>his sleek flying ship. Two excited young <!--ERRTAG-RE-63440-->Kai Aspirants<!--/ERRTAG-RE-63440--> bring word of his arrival to the vault and you respond by making your way swiftly to the surface. Banedon<ch.apos/>s <cite>Skyrider</cite> is hovering above the training park, the hum of its magical engine amplified by the surrounding walls and battlements. It is dusk on this wintry evening and a shower of feathery snow is illuminated by the craft<ch.apos/>s lanterns. A rope ladder hangs from the bow rail to the frost-hardened earth.</p>
       <p><quote>Go aboard, Grand Master,</quote> <!--ERRTAG-RE-63972-->urges Rimoah.<!--/ERRTAG-RE-63972--> <quote>Banedon will advise you and provide you with what you<ch.apos/>ll be needing. I shall stay here and pray for your safe return.</quote></p>
       <p>You bid a hasty farewell to your mentor before climbing the dangling rope ladder with the legendary speed and grace that sets you apart from lesser warriors. Banedon is waiting as you haul yourself aboard. He greets you with a glad smile, yet his face cannot hide his deep concern for what may await you in Ixia. You wave a final farewell to Lord Rimoah; then you retreat to the warmth of Banedon<ch.apos/>s cabin as the <cite>Skyrider</cite> glides over the Monastery<ch.apos/>s southern wall and ascends into the leaden sky.</p>
       <p>Your friend Banedon has already set a course for Vadera, the principal city of Lencia, a destination which is more than a full day<ch.apos/>s flight west of Sommerlund. Were this not the first stage of a longer voyage to Ixia you would gladly welcome the chance to visit Vadera, for you have many friends there in the court of King Sarnac of Lencia.</p>
       <p>During the flight, Banedon details the plans which have been made on your behalf. King Sarnac himself has promised his help; he will provide you with a boat and a pilot to sail you from Vadera to Azgad Island, a desolate Lencian outpost in the Tozaz Sea. On your arrival there you will be transferred to a Lencian ice-boat, a craft specially built to withstand the power of the treacherous <!--ERRTAG-RE-65461-->pack-ice<!--/ERRTAG-RE-65461--> which clings to the Ixian shoreline at this time of the year.</p>
       <p><quote>The ice-boat will land you on the coast of Ixia, Lone Wolf,</quote> says Banedon, <quote>and then it will wait at anchor for you to return upon the completion of your mission.</quote></p>
       <p><quote>How long will the <!--ERRTAG-RE-65775-->ice-boat<!--/ERRTAG-RE-65775--> wait for me?</quote> you ask, apprehensively.</p>
       <p><quote>If you do not return within <!--ERRTAG-RE-65937-->seven days, the pilot<!--/ERRTAG-RE-65937--> has orders to set sail for Vadera without you. The Tozaz in winter is a cruel and terrible sea<ch.emdash/>no ordinary man could hope to survive there for much longer than a week, no matter how strong his ship or plentiful his supplies. Which reminds me<ch.emdash/>if you are to survive your visit to Deathlord Ixiataaga<ch.apos/>s frigid realm, you will be needing some special protection.</quote></p>

       <p>Drawing on your Magnakai skills of camouflage and psychic defence to shield your body and mind, you leave your hiding place and hurry through the open archway. Several hundred yards <!--ERRTAG-RE-72582-->beyond, you<!--/ERRTAG-RE-72582--> come to a wide stone staircase which ascends to a landing, positioned high above the underground lake and ice cavern. As you climb the steps, the sub-zero temperature plummets even further, making you shiver involuntarily, despite the combined protection of your Platinum Amulet and your Magnakai skills.</p>
       <p>At length you reach the landing to be greeted by the sight of two undead Ixian warriors standing guard at the mouth of a cave. Instinctively, you sidestep into the shadows to avoid being seen, but the Ixians show no reactions; <!--ERRTAG-RE-73183-->it is as if<!--/ERRTAG-RE-73183--> they have both been cast in stone.</p>
       <p>Beyond the open cave mouth you see a bleak and desolate wasteland of rock and ice. A blizzard is raging, whipped up by a fierce electrical storm that blazes above a distant mountain range. The jagged peaks are illuminated by the flashes of the storm<ch.apos/>s ghostly, blue-white fire.</p>

       <p>Your Kai senses tell you that the evil sorcery which animates and controls the guards is temporarily dormant: these two skeletons currently pose no threat to your safety. However, the same cannot be said of the troop of undead Drakkarim warriors who, at this moment, are marching up the stairs behind you. Reluctantly, you leave the cave mouth and set off into the raging blizzard in search of the city of Xaagon.</p>

       <p>You pilot the ship cautiously along a string of narrow fjords which cut an uncertain route through this treacherous field of icebergs. Using a mix of hand signals and telepathy, you send directions to the helmsman at the rear of the ship. It is a gruelling procedure which soon takes its toll on the nerves of all aboard.</p>
       <p>Every few minutes your vision is obscured by gusts of powdery snow which swirl across the deck, blown down from the tops of the surrounding ice cliffs. During one of these fierce blasts you are momentarily blinded. You clasp your hands to your stinging eyes and suddenly the incessant howl of the wind is accompanied by the tortured screech of the hull as it shudders along a bank of submerged ice. The impact sends the ship careering violently to port and almost hurls you overboard. You crash heavily against the rail and rebound to the deck where you lie for a few moments, stunned and gasping for breath: lose 2 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points.</p>
       <p>Mindful of the deadly danger, you scramble to your feet and rush to the prow. The crew have been clearly terrified by the collision; most of them are cowering along the ship<ch.apos/>s rail, staring up at the encroaching walls of ice, their eyes haunted with fear as earnestly they offer prayers to the Goddess Ishir. Then, almost without any warning, the snow-laden wind abates and the ship emerges from the iceberg field into the open waters of the Tozaz Sea. The crew give a hearty cheer, relieved that their icy ordeal has at last come to an end. One man pulls the cork from a bottle of black rum which he has been keeping for a special occasion. He takes a mighty swig, then passes it to you. Just as you are about to take a swallow, unexpectedly you hear the helmsman<ch.apos/>s voice echoing along the deck: <quote>Ship ahoy!</quote></p>
       <p>Fear returns to tie a knot in your stomach as you turn and focus your eagle eyes upon the distant vessel.</p>

       <p>You sense that the wisps of black smoke are a manifestation of several evil beings, each possessed of a strong psychic presence. Fearing attack, you quickly draw upon your Magnakai Discipline of Psi-screen to construct a defensive wall to protect yourself from the possibility of psychic assault. It is a wise precaution, but one that proves ineffective against these powerful entities.</p>
       <p>Moments after your psychic wall is in place, the wisps streak across the chamber and encircle your body. They accelerate to a dizzying speed before launching a massive wave of psychic energy at your mind. This tidal wave batters <!--ERRTAG-RE-96008-->your Psi-screen<!--/ERRTAG-RE-96008--> and leaves you trembling with psychic shock: lose 8 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points.</p>

A flash of lightning briefly illuminates the cave and, for the first time, you see the face of this mysterious beast: the sight is truly chilling to behold. Its mouth is a mass of twisted fangs and from its huge, bear-like body there writhes a score of slimy tentacles, each tipped with a venomous claw. Its reptilian head is domed and <!--ERRTAG-RE-166240-->from its centre<!--/ERRTAG-RE-166240--> there protrudes a twisted horn, longer than a broadsword.</p>

Steps have been chiselled into its translucent north wall, a slippery staircase which ascends to a landing positioned high above the ice-cavern.

       <p>After a tiring climb you reach the landing to be greeted by the sight of an unguarded cave mouth. Through this opening you see a bleak and desolate wasteland of rock and ice. A blizzard is raging, whipped up by a fierce electrical storm that blazes above a distant mountain range. The jagged grey peaks are illuminated by the flashes of the storm<ch.apos/>s ghostly, blue-white fire.</p>

Your hands, slick with nervous sweat, grip the wheel tightly and inch it back and forth in response to the pilot<ch.apos/>s frantic signals.

       <p>Then, almost without any warning, the snow-laden wind abates and the ship emerges from the iceberg field into the open waters of the Tozaz Sea.

       <p>Lanza is a stocky, hard-nosed soldier whose leathery, frost-bitten face bears living testimony to the five years he has spent as commander of this bleak, godforsaken outpost.

At his <!--ERRTAG-RE-195749-->court-martial<!--/ERRTAG-RE-195749--> he had been allowed to choose his fate<ch.emdash/>command of the notorious Azgad Island garrison, or death by hanging.

You warm yourself in front of an open grate and listen as he and Prarg discuss your onward passage to Ixia aboard the garrison<ch.apos/>s ice-boat.

       <p>The ghastly creature shrieks with undisguised glee as it prepares to strike you down. It raises its jagged rod of ice and sparks ignite at the tip<ch.emdash/>the prelude to another devastating blast of energy which the beast is about to aim at your crouching form. You reach for your own weapon, desperate to defend yourself, but as your hand closes around the hilt you hear the unexpected sound of rushing wind. Suddenly a spear-like missile hits the creature in the back and explodes from its chest. The impact sends the beast cartwheeling past you to slam into the ice-boat<ch.apos/>s mast. You look towards the watchtower and see Prarg at the parapet, standing behind a catapult-like pantard, his clenched fist raised in triumph. You return his salute, thankful that his aim was true.</p>
       <p>The pantard bolt has pinned the creature to the mast but it has not destroyed it. Howling with anger, it twists and writhes to get free. Then, as if drawn by its unhuman cries, a mass of skeletal warriors come charging down the gangplank towards you. Instinctively, you draw your weapon and strike the plank a mighty blow, splitting it cleanly in two. Both sections collapse and the onrushing skeletons tumble helplessly into the icy water.</p>

       <p>With your briefing now concluded, King Sarnac ushers you all into his court chamber. There you bid him, Lord Ardan, and Guildmaster Banedon farewell, and they in turn wish you good luck and godspeed before Captain Prarg escorts you to the harbour. It is snowing heavily, and few of Vadera<ch.apos/>s inhabitants notice as the two of you are welcomed aboard the <cite>Maycastle</cite>, the square-rigged man-o<ch.apos/>-war which will carry you to Azgad Island.</p>
       <p>You leave Vadera within the hour and begin the long, cold voyage northwards. During the voyage, Captain Prarg tells you about the raids which have destroyed several small Drakkarim settlements along the Gulf of Konkor and the coast of the Shakoz Bight. On the twelfth day of your two-week sea journey, you catch a glimpse of one such settlement, near to the mouth of the River Lenag. All that remains is a wispy pall of smoke which hangs above the burnt-out hovels, darkening an already stormy sky.</p>
       <p>For most of the voyage, a host of seabirds have accompanied the <cite>Maycastle</cite>, attracted by the scraps of food regularly thrown out by the ship<ch.apos/>s galley. But at dawn on the thirteenth day, as the ship enters the Gulf of Konkor, the usual flocks of shrieking gulls are nowhere to be seen. It is as if they have suddenly become aware of impending danger and have turned back, eager to stay out of harm<ch.apos/>s reach. Later in the day, a fierce squall arises from the east which whips the iron-grey waters of the gulf into a maelstrom. The crew fight desperately to control their ship as the storm rages all day and all night, not abating until dawn of the following day. As the wind gradually dies and the sea settles, the lookout is able to resume his post atop the mainmast.</p>

       <p>Silently you climb the stairs and peer over the lip of the hatch; you are just in time to witness a scene which shocks you to the core. You see that the undead Drakkarim warriors have slain all of the Lencian crewmen and have heaped their bodies around the base of the <!--ERRTAG-RE-236097-->mainmast<!--/ERRTAG-RE-236097-->. One of the undead, clad in a filthy grey cloak embroidered with alien symbols, utters a chilling liturgy over the corpses of the slain. You sense something is very wrong. The chill air crackles with power and sparks of evil energy whirl around their bodies. When at last the liturgy ends, you see to your horror the slain Lencians rise up and take their places alongside the Drakkarim undead.</p>

       <p>Revolted and angered by what you have witnessed, you vow to avenge the souls of the crew and draw your weapon in readiness to attack the host of Drakkarim undead. But before you can act, you feel a shudder run through the deck. The great vessel which has swallowed your ship is lurching to a halt. There is a dull boom, then several portals open in the surrounding walls of the host vessel, spilling beams of white light across the deck of your captive ship. Scores of Drakkarim undead emerge from these portals and descend upon the ship like a host of hungry ghouls. You are forced to abandon your plan for vengeance<ch.emdash/>there are now far too many of the enemy. Yet all is not lost. In the milling confusion, you seize an opportunity to get away from the ship and escape into one of the light-filled portals.</p>

       <p>When you regain consciousness, it seems as if you have been knocked out for no more than a few minutes, but as your mind clears you sense that you are still at sea, although no longer in the hold of the Ixian ice-boat. Countless hours, perhaps even days, could have elapsed since you were knocked out, and now you find yourself lying face down on the floor of a small dank cell. Instinctively you reach for your weapon<ch.emdash/>but it is no longer there. Your head throbs, your body aches viciously, and your mood is further soured when you discover that your Backpack, your Weapons, and all of your Special Items (with the exception of your Platinum Amulet) are missing.</p>
       <p>You roll over wearily and drag yourself to your feet. You can hear noises in a distant part of this vessel and, when you intensify your hearing, you become aware that this mysterious craft is slowing down as if in preparation to dock. Anxious to escape, and doubly anxious to retrieve your missing equipment, you step towards the door of the cell.</p>

       <p>As your divine blade inflicts the wounds which destroy these creatures, their bodies undergo a swift and gruesome transformation. They implode, twisting and shrinking as they contract, until all that is left are three evil-smelling pools of bubbling black venom surrounded by melted ice and fragments of smouldering cloth.</p>
       <p>You sheathe the Sommerswerd and step away from the foul remains. But as you turn to leave the ruins, you hear a terrifying howl that makes your blood run cold. With fearful anticipation you look up at the towering <!--ERRTAG-RE-259049-->Crystal Spire<!--/ERRTAG-RE-259049--> and see, illuminated by lightning flashes, the awesome figure of Deathlord Ixiataaga. He stands behind the parapet of a window in the upper reaches of the spire, the Deathstaff raised high in his ungodly hand. He has sensed the presence of the Sommerswerd and he has determined to destroy it.</p>
       <p>You see a flash of white light explode at the tip of the Deathstaff and, in the very next instant, you feel agonizing pain shoot through every part of your body. Then an explosion of white-hot fire obliterates your senses and, in a terrifying instant, the light that is your life is snuffed out.</p>
       <p>Tragically, you have fallen victim to the Deathlord of Ixia. Your life and your quest end here.</p>

Before leaving the cell you pause for a few moments to use your Magnakai skill of Nexus in an attempt to determine the location of your missing weapons and equipment. You sense they are distant. Guided by your feelings, you turn to the right and go off along the corridor in search of them.</p>
       <p>The dingy, ice-caked corridor wends its way deeper into the bowels of this vast alien vessel. You explore a maze of empty holds, where the walls are braced with gleaming crystal girders, and pass through low-ceilinged chambers that, despite the biting chill, reek of death and decay. At length your search ends at a great grey door which is guarded by two undead Drakkarim warriors, armed with spears. The noises you heard earlier have now ceased, and so has the movement of the vessel. You sense that this craft is no longer at sea.</p>

       <p>From out of the eerie mist there looms a high-prowed ship, wrought of age-blackened timbers which glisten with ice and frost. It speeds into the harbour and a morbid terror grips the hearts of the Lencian garrison when they see that it is crewed by a cadaverous host of skeletal warriors. A ghastly wail arises from the invading ship, an unholy shriek that shatters the garrison<ch.apos/>s will to resist. As one, the shocked Lencians turn and flee from the quayside, dropping and discarding their supplies and weapons in their hurry to get away.</p>

He had intended to use its power on you, to extract details of your mission, but the swiftness of your attack has preempted this. The skeletal being shrieks with anger as you wrestle the rod from his grasp. Suddenly, a blast of red-hot fire erupts from its tip, carving a fist-sized chunk of stone from the cell wall. The recoil of the blast makes you drop the rod, which falls to the floor, close to the booted feet of the other skeletal guards.</p>

       <p>Less than a mile to the north, like some nightmare apparition surfacing from the deep, you see a broad-prowed vessel of prodigious size breaking low in the stormy water. You magnify your vision and see that its main deck is completely enclosed by a canopy of overlapping green-grey timbers, affording it the appearance of some gigantic fish. Two glassy portholes and a jagged line which stretches around its prow complete this chilling illusion.</p>
       <p>For its shape and size it moves towards your ship at an unnatural speed. You call the crew to arms, fearing it to be an enemy vessel closing to attack, and you sense a shudder run through them when, for the first time, they clearly discern its alien design. You focus your Kai senses upon the oncoming craft and suddenly you realize its purpose. It is an Ixian vessel, come to rendezvous with your ship, believing it still to be manned by the undead horde which attacked Fort Azgad.</p>

       <p>You spin around to see a horde of monstrous shapes come streaming along the mossy ridge which you have just travelled.

It is a ghastly sight<ch.emdash/>a regiment of <!--ERRTAG-RA-325620-->Chaos-creatures<!--/ERRTAG-RA-325620-->, drawn here by the scent of human prey.

       <p>The great alien vessel looms towards your ship, its jaw-like prow hinged open as if in readiness to bite you in half. Then, with stunning swiftness, your entire craft is consumed by this onrushing vessel, swallowed up in its great jaws. There is a moment of deadly silence. Then, in the morbid, greenish gloom, you hear a bubbling rush of icy water echoing through the vast depths of this gullet. With fearful anticipation you unsheathe your weapon, move towards the ship<ch.apos/>s rail, then look down. The surrounding seawater is fast draining away, leaving your ship dry-docked upon a long, V-shaped plinth which glistens like polished bone. The bubbling subsides, to be replaced by another noise<ch.emdash/>the sound of a great portal grinding open. Bright light streams across the deck, blazing down from an archway which is opening close to the starboard bow. Silhouetted in this light are a hundred moving forms, each man-sized and armed with a sword or a spear. A ghastly howl of anger arises from their ranks when they see unexpectedly that the ship is crewed by living men. As the first of their number leap from the arch and crash upon the deck, you recognize their form. Once these creatures were Drakkarim warriors; now they are undead slaves in the service of the Ixian Deathlord. You shout to the Lencians to prepare for battle as the first wave of undead Drakkarim comes surging forwards.</p>

But as you turn towards the archway that these fell creatures were guarding, you are confronted by a terrifying sight. Framed in the archway is the awesome figure of Deathlord Ixiataaga himself, the Deathstaff raised high in his ungodly hand. He has sensed the presence of the Sommerswerd and he has come to destroy it. Stunned by his awful visage, you fail to react in time to save yourself. You see a flash of white light explode at the tip of the staff and, in the very next instant, you feel agonizing pain shoot through every part of your body. Then an explosion of white-hot fire obliterates your senses and, in a terrifying instant, the light that is your life is snuffed out.</p>

       <p>You advance slowly along the slippery foredeck towards steps which ascend to the raised stern of this alien vessel. Every inch of its coal-black timbers are decorated with strange and intricate carvings, and archaic symbols embellish the metal rails which encircle its gunwales. Drawing on your Grand Master Disciplines, you determine that this vessel was not constructed by the unhuman creatures who crewed it, but that it is an ancient ship, built and crafted by a race of mariners who have long since disappeared into the mists of time. Closer examination of the timbers reveals it to be more than fifteen thousand years old.</p>
       <p>You climb to the wheelhouse, which stands in the centre of the stern deck, and discover there a large, glassy sphere mounted upon an ornate base of glittering black stone. A low hum and a faint greenish glow radiate from this sphere, which in turn is connected by silver tubes and strands of braided metal to the wheel which steers the craft. After careful study of the controls you feel confident that you could sail the vessel.</p>

       <p>Using your advanced mastery, you magnify your vision in order to see better the new enemy that is descending towards you from out of the sky. As the images grow larger, you see that the leading Lavas is holding an item which radiates an intense aura of evil power.

But as the last one falls, its corpse-like body almost severed at the waist, you hear a noise behind you which makes you spin around in fearful expectation.</p>

You vow to avenge the souls of the crewmen and draw your weapon in readiness to attack the host of Drakkarim undead who are standing in rows upon the deck. But before you can act, you feel a shudder run through the steps as the host vessel comes lurching to a halt. There is a dull boom and then several portals open in the surrounding wall, spilling beams of white light across the deck of your captive ship. Scores of Drakkarim undead emerge from these portals and descend upon the ship like a host of hungry ghouls. You are forced to abandon your plan for vengeance for there are now far too many of the enemy. Yet all is not lost.

       <p>Your Kai senses quickly become attuned to the powerful psychic residues which linger in this chamber. You notice that several empty coffins lie scattered about the floor and, when you focus upon them, chilling dream-like images form in your mind<ch.apos/>s eye. You see the accursed Deathstaff emerging from the Shadow Gate. It spins end-over-end and impacts against the heavy stone lid of a coffin, breaking it in two. Its evil power feeds un-life into the mouldering remains of the <!--ERRTAG-RE-406351-->Ixian Elder<!--/ERRTAG-RE-406351--> lying within and, driven by this ungodly energy, the remains rise up from their stony tomb. The resurrected Ixian bears the Deathstaff to the highest chamber of the <!--ERRTAG-RA-406231-->Crystal Spire<!--/ERRTAG-RA-406231--> where, imprisoned in a cage of light fashioned by the Elder Magi, stands Deathlord Ixiataaga. The Ixian pushes the Deathstaff through the wall of this shimmering prison and, with a crackling flash, the cage of light vanishes. Freed from the magical prison which has kept him secure for thousands of years, Deathlord Ixiataaga takes the Deathstaff and howls with manic glee as he rejoices in his fateful escape.</p>
       <p>The disturbing images fade from your mind, driven away by your <!--ERRTAG-RE-407081-->Kai Sixth Sense<!--/ERRTAG-RE-407081--> which is warning you of imminent danger. A wispy black vapour is leaking from the circular stone edging which abuts the whirling Shadow Gate.

Your Kai senses detect an all-consuming aura of evil which saturates this swampy land, warning you that this foul, stinking mire is part of the Plane of Darkness<ch.emdash/>the domain of the Dark God Naar.

       <p>From your hiding place among the boulders you watch the activities of the loathsome undead. The causeway and jetty are teeming with cadaverous soldiers who, under the direction of several spindly, black-clad creatures, are busily transferring materials to and from the ice-boats and the open mouth of the submarine. The tunnel entrance lies only two hundred yards away, yet reaching it without being detected by the enemy looks to be a near-impossible task. You are trying to formulate a plan of action when suddenly you notice a means by which you can achieve your goal.</p>
       <p>The track, which branches away from the causeway and leads to the tunnel entrance, passes close beside your hiding place. Every so often a wagon loaded with equipment trundles along this track towards the jetty, and an empty one trundles back. When the next empty wagon appears, you get ready to abandon your hiding place and leap aboard its open tailgate.</p>
       <p>Patiently you observe your chosen wagon. It is being hauled by a shaggy, grey-furred beast of burden which is harnessed by heavy leather straps. As it trundles past the boulders you break cover, leap aboard the tail, and hide yourself from sight beneath a greasy, foul-smelling tarpaulin. Through a crack in its ancient wooden planks you watch with trepidation as the wagon moves slowly towards the tunnel entrance. It enters the tunnel, unchallenged by the skeletal warriors who stand guard here, and ascends a gentle gradient to another ice-walled cavern. Several passages connect at this point from all directions, like the spokes of a giant wheel converging at the hub.</p>

       <p>Using your <!--ERRTAG-RE-422716-->Kai Mastery<!--/ERRTAG-RE-422716-->, you are able to see patterns in the ultraviolet spectrum of light. You recognize that the light which is pouring from the holes in the side of this diabolical machine is very similar to that which normally radiates from the sun, but it is abnormally intense. A tingle of fear runs along your spine the moment you realize that the ghostly rays are a deadly threat to any living creature.</p>

       <p>Lanza orders his men to arm themselves with warhammers from a nearby hut.</p>
       <p><quote>Normally my men use these to break up harbour ice in the dead of winter,</quote> he says, as together you help to distribute the heavy two-handed hammers among the garrison, <quote>but now they can be put to good use smashing up the bones of our foes!</quote></p>
       <p>Freshly equipped and fired by the taste of victory, Lanza and his men set about hammering the remnants of the attacking enemy. They drive them all the way back to their ship, literally shattering all who dare stand in their way. Within the hour the outpost is secured<ch.emdash/>the enemy have been destroyed.</p>
       <p>You survey the aftermath of the battle with mixed emotions. You feel elated at having helped Lanza to win, but the ice-boat, which was to have conveyed you to Ixia, is now a burned wreck lying at the bottom of the harbour. All that can be seen of it is a few feet of its <!--ERRTAG-RE-449135-->mainmast<!--/ERRTAG-RE-449135--> protruding at an angle above the surface of the sea. As you stare at this blackened masthead, you are joined by Captain Prarg.</p>

       <p>Your bold decision to turn back to the jetty buys you precious time; it also saves you from the jaws of an Ixian Gybia<ch.emdash/>a ferocious underwater predator. Seconds after hauling yourself out of the water, the massive body of this creature surges past, barely a few feet from where you are clinging limpet-like to the jetty wall. The sight of this huge monster electrifies you, sending you scurrying to the top of the jetty as quickly as your aching limbs will allow. From a makeshift hiding place among some wooden crates, you look down at the swirling water and watch as the Gybia circles the jetty in a wide arc. On its second sweep, it veers away and returns disappointedly to its underwater pen.</p>
       <p>The jetty is teeming with undead soldiers who, under the direction of the same black-clad creature who released the Gybia, are busily transferring materials to and from the open mouth of the submarine. Getting past this creature and its undead minions in order to reach the shore looks, at first sight, a near-impossible task. Then you notice a means by which you could achieve your goal without having to face the predator for a second time.</p>

       <p>Two days out from the Tozaz ice-field, you catch sight of Fort Azgad. After the ordeal of Ixia, the sight of this spartan little outpost is one of the most welcoming you have ever seen. The garrison salutes you as you bring your ship to the quayside where Lord Ardan, Captain Lanza, and Prarg are all waiting to welcome you back.</p>
       <p>Warmly they congratulate you, praising your inspired act of courage and bravery but you sense that all is not well. The feeling of unease which haunted you upon leaving the ice-caverns of Ixia has returned.</p>

       <p>Ardan<ch.apos/>s face grows as sombre as his reply. <quote>King Ulnar sent word to Sarnac<ch.apos/>s court, summoning the Guildmaster to return urgently to Sommerlund. It is <!--ERRTAG-RE-467312-->grave news, I<ch.apos/>m afraid<!--/ERRTAG-RE-467312-->, Grand Master. In your absence, your country has been attacked. The Dark God, Naar, has sent forth a host of dragon-creatures to destroy the Second Order of the Kai and lay waste to your homeland. It is said his new minions are confident of swift victory for they are sure you will never defeat the Deathlord of Ixia.</quote></p>
       <p><quote>I must leave for Sommerlund at once,</quote> you say, looking to the eastern horizon. <quote>My brethren and my <!--ERRTAG-RE-460493-->country<!--/ERRTAG-RE-460493--> need me.</quote></p>
       <p>The others nod in silent agreement. <quote>We will do all we can,</quote> replies Lord Ardan, <quote>to speed your passage home.</quote></p>
       <p>The news of your country<ch.apos/>s plight comes as a terrible shock. In Ixia, you have won a great and lasting victory against the forces of Evil, but could the cost be too great? You fear, also, for the lives of your young Kai acolytes. The Second Order are worthy Kai warriors but they are young, their mettle yet to be tested in the furnace-heat of battle. You pray to Kai himself that they be strong enough to resist Naar<ch.apos/>s newest champions, at least until you return.</p>
       <p>The challenge of the long journey <!--ERRTAG-RE-461256-->home and<!--/ERRTAG-RE-461256--> the quest to save the Second Order of the Kai from the deadly wrath of Naar<ch.apos/>s newest champions awaits you in the next Grand Master adventure, entitled:</p>
