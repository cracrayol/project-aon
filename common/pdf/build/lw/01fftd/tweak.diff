 During your training as a Kai Lord you have developed fighting prowess---{\sc Combat Skill} and physical stamina---{\sc Endurance}. Before you set off on your adventure you need to measure how effective your training has been. To do this take a pencil and, with your eyes closed, point with the blunt end of it onto the \hyperlink{random}{\emph{Random Number Table}}. If you pick 0 it counts as zero.
+\end{sloppypar}
 
 The first number that you pick from the \hyperlink{random}{\emph{Random Number Table}} in this way represents your {\sc Combat Skill}. Add 10 to the number you picked and write the total in the {\sc Combat Skill} section of your \hyperlink{action}{\emph{Action Chart}} (i.e. if your pencil fell on the number 4 in the \hyperlink{random}{\emph{Random Number Table}} you would write in a {\sc Combat Skill} of 14). When you fight, your {\sc Combat Skill} will be pitted against that of your enemy. A high score in this section is therefore very desirable.
