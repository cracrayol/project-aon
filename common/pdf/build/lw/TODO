BUGS:
----

- In LaTeX some sections end up with their 'choices' sections being orphaned. 
  The XSL style has been changed to add a \nopagebreak in choices but
  it still happens some times.

  Solution #1: (Thomas Wolmer)
  > <all text paragraphs erxcept the last one>
  > \begin{samepage}
  > <last text paragraph>
  > <all choices>
  > \end{samepage}

  Solution #2: (Ingo Kloecker)

  Use \enlargethispage{\baselineskip} (or some multiple of \baselineskip) to
  fit more on a page or \newpage (or something similar) to force a page break.

  Whatever the solution that means changing the TeX files and changes have to
  be preserved (see TODO item #1)


TODO: 
----

 * Use the Souvenir font or another (good) alternative. 

 * (if using non-Standard fonts) Embed fonts in documents, this is recommended
  procedure in order to make sure it looks good in all PDF readers. Some PDF
  readers might not have the exact font and replace it with a different one and
  make it look ugly.

  Note: This might violate the licensing use of the font, however

- Use PNG files instead of generating PDF files as this is not required when
  using pdflatex (as opposed of using latex + dvips)

- [Spanish] Provide bearer scroll and action chart for the Grandmaster and New
  Order series for Spanish under es/pdf/lw/$series/ 

    Note: Already done for Kai

DONE
----

- PDF file is currently missing:
    - Action Chart
    - Random Number Table

- Make it possible to have external patches to the TeX files that get applied
  before build
  
- Add meta-data when generating PDF files, this can be done either using
    pdftk (pdftk in.pdf update_info in.info output out.pdf )  or (better yet)
    using hyperxmp. See
    http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/hyperxmp/

    To see the current metadata provided
       pdftk <book_name>.pdf dump_data output -
    or (simpler)
        pdfinfo <book_name>.pdf

- [Spanish] Update Makefiles to define 'series'
