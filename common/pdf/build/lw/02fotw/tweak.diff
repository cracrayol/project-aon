 During your training as a Kai Lord you have developed fighting prowess---{\sc Combat Skill} and physical stamina---{\sc Endurance}. Before you set off on your adventure you need to measure how effective your training has been. To do this take a pencil and, with your eyes closed, point with the blunt end of it onto the \hyperlink{random}{\emph{Random Number Table}}. If you pick 0 it counts as zero.
+\end{sloppypar}
 
 The first number that you pick from the \hyperlink{random}{\emph{Random Number Table}} in this way represents your {\sc Combat Skill}. Add 10 to the number you picked and write the total in the {\sc Combat Skill} section of your \hyperlink{action}{\emph{Action Chart}} (i.e. if your pencil fell on 4 in the \hyperlink{random}{\emph{Random Number Table}} you would write in a {\sc Combat Skill} of 14). When you fight, your {\sc Combat Skill} will be pitted against that of your enemy. A high score in this section is therefore very desirable.

 Holmgard has suffered much since your departure. Many of the shops and houses you remember passing on your way to the quay, are little more now than heaps of ashes. The Darklords' army with their evil engines of war surround the walls, and the flaming arcs of fireballs shooting through the air continually light the night sky as they rain down on the streets below. The people fight the fire as best they can, but they are hungry and exhausted and close to surrender. At first, as it enters the harbour, the fleet is mistaken for the enemy and cries of despair can be heard all along the quay. But as the first of the soldiers set foot in the city and unfurl the royal arms of Durenor, the news of your return spreads quickly. The cries of despair have changed to a chorus of cheers: `The Kai Lord has returned.'
