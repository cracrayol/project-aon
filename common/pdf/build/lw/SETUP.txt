The build of PDF files has been tested in a Linux environment with the
following tools:

    - Tex
        More specifically: texlive        2012.2012061

        Including the following packages (in Debian GNU/Linux or Ubuntu):

        texlive-extra-utils, texlive-font-utils, texlive-fonts-extra,
        texlive-fonts-recommended, texlive-lang-spanish,
        texlive-pictures, texlive-pstricks, texlive-latex-base, 
        texlive-latex-extra, texlive-latex-recommended

    - XeTex packages. 
        Specifically: texlive-xetex  2012.2012061

    - lcdf-typetools  (version 2.92-2)

    [ Note: some other required software might be needed, the above
      list is not complete ]

XeTeX is used instead of pdflatex (or even latex)  since it is easier to
generate PDF files with the Souvenir font (see below)

Testing your setup
-----------------

The directory 'setup_test' includes a tex file and Makefile to ensure that your
system is properly setup to build the PDF files and embed the fonts properly.

If you want to test your setup, just get into the directory and run 'make' or
'make test'


Setting up Souvenir fonts
------------------------

In order to build the PDF with the Souvenir font you need to install the
corresponding otf (OpenTypeFont) in your system. The easiest way is to simply
copy them to your user.

Just create the ~/.fonts/ directory and copy all of the OTF files there.

If you do not have these fonts please contact the Project Aon developers. The
font is not included in the SVN repository as its redistributing is limited.
Project Aon has purchased a license for this font that is only provided to
developers that do the PDF builds.

Your directory should contain at least these fonts:

jfs@silicio:xsl$ ls -ltr ~/.fonts
total 144
-rwxr-xr-x 1 jfs jfs 33492 sep 24 00:39 SouvenirStd-Demi.otf
-rwxr-xr-x 1 jfs jfs 35088 sep 24 00:39 SouvenirStd-DemiItalic.otf
-rwxr-xr-x 1 jfs jfs 35892 sep 24 00:39 SouvenirStd-LightItalic.otf
-rwxr-xr-x 1 jfs jfs 33752 sep 24 00:39 SouvenirStd-Light.otf

For reference, the following listing shows the output of running the 'otinfo'
tool in the fonts above:

 for i in ~/.fonts/*otf; do echo `basename $i`; otfinfo -i $i; echo; echo ; done
