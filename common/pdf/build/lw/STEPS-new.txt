Steps to create a new PDF book

1- Create the directory for the book: mkdir 0XXXX
2- Copy the general Makefile: Makefile.basic into this directory
     cp Makefile.basic 0XXXX/Makefile

3- Edit the book series
4- Edit the language (if other than english)


5- Enter that directory
6- Run 'make install'
7- Your PDF files will be in the 'FINAL' subdirectory that has been created
   just for you
8- Run 'make distclean' to clean all the files used for the build

Due to a bug in the XSL location you also have to do this:

- Go to the 'en/xml/' (or '/es/xml') directory (from the SVN root).
  Symlink/Copy the latex.xsl file with the one at 'common/xsl' like this: 
  (  cd en/xml && ln -s ../../common/xsl/latex.xsl . )


Enjoy!

The Makefile script should take care of the following automatically:

Generate the TeX file for the book using gbtolatex.pl
   Example: 
     ../../../scripts/gbtolatex.pl 0XXXX  - English files
     ../../../scripts/gbtolatex.pl 0XXXX es - Spanish files

Link to the *tex files at ../../shared/*tex:
    for i in ../../shared/*sty ; do ln $i . ; done

    English:

    for i in ../../shared/*tex ; do ln $i . ; done

    Spanish:

    for i in ../../shared/es/*tex ; do ln $i . ; done

    [ This makes all shared TeX files available:
      ac1.tex  ac2.tex  crtneg.tex  crtpos.tex  random.tex  souvenir.sty
      souverbt.sty ] 

Link all common images:
 for i in ../../../../../en/gif/lw/0XXX/ill/*{pdf,gif}; do ln $i . ; done

Note: for translations you first have to link to the images in the 
translated directory and *then* link to the files to the original (English)
book. So it's:
 for i in ../../../../../es/gif/ls/0XXX/ill/*/*{pdf,gif}; do ln $i . ; done
 for i in ../../../../../en/gif/lw/0XXX/ill/*{pdf,gif}; do ln $i . ; done
 [ The second one will probably output errors of common images that will
   not be overwritten, discard those ] 

Convert the images into PDF so that they can be included in the TeX file:

   sh ../../convert-images.sh
