 During your training as a Kai Lord you have developed fighting prowess---{\sc Combat Skill} and physical stamina---{\sc Endurance}. Before you set off on your adventure you need to measure how effective your training has been. To do this take a pencil and, with your eyes closed, point with the blunt end of it onto the \hyperlink{random}{\emph{Random Number Table}}. If you pick 0 it counts as zero.
+\end{sloppypar}
 
 The first number that you pick from the \hyperlink{random}{\emph{Random Number Table}} in this way represents your {\sc Combat Skill}. Add 10 to the number you picked and write the total in the {\sc Combat Skill} section of your \hyperlink{action}{\emph{Action Chart}} (i.e. if your pencil fell on 4 in the \hyperlink{random}{\emph{Random Number Table}} you would write in a {\sc Combat Skill} of 14). When you fight, your {\sc Combat Skill} will be pitted against that of your enemy. A high score in this section is therefore very desirable.

 You manage to hang on to the struggling child, and remove a bone dagger from his boot to prevent him stabbing you in the back.

 The Ice Barbarians have drawn themselves up into a circle around you, but they dare not attack while you are holding one of their children as a hostage. Holding the bone dagger to the child's throat, you slowly inch your way towards the sledge. You soon realize that you will never be able to outdistance them on a loaded sledge. You will have to think of something---and quickly.

 As the colours fade, you become aware of a sudden drop in temperature. You now stand upon the Ljuk ice shelf at a point less than half a mile from where the {\itshape Cardonal} lies at anchor. Loi-Kymar and Vonotar are close by, both shivering in the chill morning air. Within minutes you are sighted by the ship's lookout and a longboat is dispatched. As a wriggling Vonotar is hoisted unceremoniously aboard the {\itshape Cardonal} and deposited in the brig the captain is the first to congratulate you on your skill and daring.
