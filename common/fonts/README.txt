Information about this directory
--------------------------------

Please only include fonts in this directory can be distributed by the Project
and can be used used to generate content to be distributed at the website
(PDF, ePUBs, etc.).  Please note that the SVN repository is publicly accesible
and fonts which are not freely distributable should *not* be included here.

This directory currently holds:

  - The Carlito font -> used to generate the  Freeway Warrior ePubs


Fonts used in Project Aon
-------------------------

The Lone Wolf and World of Lone Wolf books were originally published using the
Souvenir font. Whileas the Freeway Warrior books were published using the
Melior font.

The Project Aon tries to use, whenever possible, the original fonts when
providing the books in digital format in order to give the new readers  of the
books the same "feeling" readers had when the original books where published.

However, licensing limitations with the fonts prevent sometimes us from being
able to deliver the fonts in all the content we publish at the website.

Lone Wolf series - Souvenir font
--------------------------------

In May 2011, Project Aon purchased a "Preview and Print" license for the ITC
Souvenir Light and Demi OpenType fonts for use with Project Aon.  This is a
5-user license. Should you require this font to create content to be
distributed at the website  please contact Jonathan blake.

The purchased license can be used in graphics, PDFs, and similar content, but
cannot be provided as a web font, as the license that the Project has no
permission for it. The Project has looked into purchasing a license for web
distribution, but this option has been ruled out due to its costs.


Freeway Warrior  - Melior font
------------------------------

The Freeway warrior series used the Melior font, but the Project does not have
any license to distribute this font.

The ePUBS for Freeway Warrior have been generated with the Carlito font which
is available in this directory.

Fonts in Website content
-----------------------

In the website, the fonts shown to the user are defined in the CSS definition.

For the Lone Wolf series they are currently the following (in order of preference):

    Souvenir
    Georgia
    Times New Roman
    Times
    Serif

Souvenir is not necesarily available in end user systems, but Georgia is
commonly supplied with Operating Systems nowadays. To our knowledge it is
distributed in the following Operating systems by default: 
Microsoft Windows 2000, Microsoft Windows XP, MacOS X and possibly even in
older operating systems (such as Windows 95/98 where it could be supplied with
Internet Explorer 4+)

GNU/Linux based operating systems might not support the Georgia fonts by
default but, in some cases, they can be provided by external downloads. For
example, Debian and Ubuntu users can install the 'ttf-mscorefonts-installer'
installer package which downloads the fonts from available mirrors and
installs them in the system transparently to the user

Note: 
 - In September 2006 it was proposed to include Gentium to the list following some 
   tests, as this open source font is available 

 - In August 2010 it was proposed to change the font listing due to the fact that the
   "Souvenir" font name was not ever commercially used. 

In the future, the font listing might change the main.css to:

font-family: "Souvenir Lt BT", "Souvenir LT", Souvenir, Georgia, Georgia, "Times New Roman", Times, serif;

Due to the licensing costs of fonts for web site used the Project has ruled
out the possibility of providing the font directly to end users. Users wishing
to read the books with the original font are free to buy it and install it in
their computer systems.

For the Freeway Warrior series, the following fonts are used (in order of
preference):

    Calibiri
    "Lucida Grande"
    Verdana
    Trebuchet
    Arial
    Helvetica
    sans-serif
