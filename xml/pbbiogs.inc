   <p><strong>Paul Bonner</strong> is the illustrator of the World of Lone Wolf series of gamebooks. His childhood love of <quote>folk-tales, fairy-stories, <cite>The Hobbit</cite>, Scandanavian tales, myths, and sagas</quote> led Paul Bonner to spend four years at Harrow, a London art school, on an illustrating course of study.</p>
   <p>His artwork for the <cite>World of Lone Wolf</cite> series is among his earliest professional work. He subsequently started freelancing for Games Workshop and later accepted a full-time position. He worked there for a few years before moving on to produce full-colour artwork (which Games Workshop had not required from him). He moved to Copenhagen, Denmark and again began to work as a freelance illustrator.</p>
