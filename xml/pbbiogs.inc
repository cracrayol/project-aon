   <p>Paul Bonner is the illustrator of the World of Lone Wolf series of gamebooks. Citing as his childhood inspirations a love of <quote>folk-tales, fairy-stories, <cite>The Hobbit</cite>, Scandanavian tales, myths, and sagas</quote>, Paul Bonner spent four years at Harrow&emdash;a London art school&emdash;on an illustrating course. His artwork for the <cite>World of Lone Wolf</cite> series is among his earliest professional work. He subsequently started freelancing for Games Workshop and later accepted a full-time position there where he stayed for a few years before moving on to produce full-colour artwork, which Games Workshop did not require from him. He moved to Copenhagen, Denmark and again began to freelance. He currently maintains a <a href="&link.paul.bonner.website;">website</a> with examples of his artwork.</p>
