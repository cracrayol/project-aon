 <title>The Jungle of Horrors</title>
 <creator class="short">Joe Dever and Gary Chalk</creator>
 <creator class="long">
  <p><strong>Joe Dever</strong>, the creator of the bestselling Lone Wolf adventure books and novels, has achieved world-wide recognition in three creative fields&emdash;as an award-winning author of international renown, as an acclaimed musician and composer, and as a games designer specialising in role-playing games.</p>
  <p>On graduating from college in 1974, Joe Dever became a professional musician, and for several years, he worked in the music industry in Europe and the United States.</p>
  <p>While working in Los Angeles in 1977 he discovered a then little-known game called <quote>Dungeons &ampersand; Dragons</quote>. Although the game was in its infancy, Joe at once realised its huge potential and began designing his own role-playing games along similar conceptual lines. These first games were to form the basis of a fantasy world called Magnamund, which later became the setting for the Lone Wolf books.</p>
  <p>Five years later, in 1982, Joe won the Advanced Dungeons &ampersand; Dragons World Championships in Baltimore, an event held before 16,000 people. Inspired and encouraged by his success at Origins, Joe decided to quit the music business and devote his time to writing and games design.</p>
  <p>In 1983, after a brief spell at Games Workshop in London, he wrote <cite>Flight from the Dark</cite>&emdash;the first Lone Wolf interactive gamebook. His manuscript immediately attracted a frenzy of interest from three major London publishing companies, all of whom bid for world rights. Joe accepted an offer of publication from Hutchinson&apos;s (later to become Century Hutchinson Ltd; now Random House UK) and <cite>Flight from the Dark</cite> was first published in 1984.</p>
  <p>This first book sold more than 100,000 copies within its first month of publication, and overseas rights were snapped up by twelve countries (including the United States, France, Germany, Japan, Italy and Sweden). The success of Joe&apos;s first book laid the foundations for the future of the Lone Wolf series, which has sold millions of copies around the world.</p>
  <p>The Lone Wolf series ended after 28 books and 14 years. Joe has continued to work in the games industry as script writer and games design consultant.</p>
  <p><strong>Gary Chalk</strong>, the illustrator of the early Lone Wolf series, was born in 1952, grew up in Hertfordshire, England. Being interested in history, he began playing war games at the age of fifteen. When he graduated from college with a Bachelor of Arts in design, Gary spent three years training in a studio before becoming a teacher in art and design.</p>
  <p>Gary was working as a children&apos;s book illustrator when he became involved in adventure gaming, an interest which eventually led to the creation of several successful games. He is the inventor/illustrator of some of Britain&apos;s biggest-selling fantasy games including Cry Havoc, Starship Captain and Battlecars (co-designed with Ian Livingstone). He is also known for his work on the very successful game, Talisman.</p>
  <p>Gary was working at Games Workshop when Joe Dever asked him to illustrate some of his manuscript of Flight from the Dark. The two teamed up after that and, they continued to work together until the eighth book in the series, <cite>The Jungle of Horrors</cite>.</p>
  <p>Gary has also drawn the illustrations in <cite>Redwall</cite> and related books, <cite>The Prince of Shadows</cite> gamebook series, and several books which he also authored. Gary continues to enjoy war gaming and works as an illustrator and model maker. He maintains a <a href="&link.gary.chalk.website;">website</a> with examples of his work.</p>

 <description class="blurb">
  <p>You are Lone Wolf. Sworn to avenge your forefathers, the Kai Lords, you must now venture into the dreaded jungle-swamps of the Danarg.</p>
  <p>Guided by Lord Paido, warrior-magician of Dessi, you begin your trek across the violent and war-torn lands of Talestria on your secret mission to capture the prized Lorestone of Ohrido.</p>
  <p>You must survive in fearsome battle the assassins of Gnaag, the armies of the dreaded Warlord Zegron and the chaos-creatures of Agarash the Damned.</p>
  <p>But nothing must stop you now, for if you fail the Lorestone of Ohrido will be lost forever and vengeance will escape your grasp.&ellips;</p>

    <p>You are the warrior, Lone Wolf, last of the Kai Masters of Sommerlund and sole survivor of the massacre that destroyed your kinsmen during a bitter war with your age-old enemies, the Darklords of Helgedad.</p>
    <p>Many centuries have passed since Sun Eagle, the first of your kind, established the Order of the Kai. Aided by the magicians of Dessi, he completed a perilous quest to find seven crystals of power, known as the Lorestones of Nyxator. On discovering them he unlocked a wisdom and strength that lay within both the Lorestones and himself. He recorded the nature of his discoveries and experiences in a great tome entitled The Book of the Magnakai. You have discovered this lost Kai treasure and have given a solemn pledge to restore the Kai to their former glory, ensuring the security of your land in the years to come. However, your diligent study of this ancient book has enabled you to master only three of the ten Magnakai Disciplines. To fulfil your pledge you must complete the quest first undertaken by Sun Eagle over one thousand years ago and find the Lorestones of Nyxator. By doing so, you, too, will acquire the power and wisdom of the Magnakai, which is held within the Lorestones&apos; crystal forms.</p>
    <p>Already your quest has taken you far from your northern homeland. Following in the footsteps of the first Kai Grand Master, you journeyed to Dessi and sought the help of the Elder Magi, the magicians who aided Sun Eagle on his quest long ago. There you learned that one of the seven Lorestones was still present in their land, hidden deep within the island stronghold known as Kazan-Oud&emdash;Castle Death. In the years since Sun Eagle first came to Dessi, the fortress of Kazan-Oud had become the abode of a great but evil sorcerer called Zahda. The Elder Magi, realizing the danger of Zahda&apos;s increasing power, attempted to destroy Kazan-Oud, but they failed. In desperation they constructed a prison of energy around the fortress to prevent Zahda from ever escaping. Steadily, however, his power grew and the people of Dessi lived in fear of the day when he would break free and wreak his vengeance upon them. When you resolved to enter Kazan-Oud to retrieve the Lorestone, the Elder Magi rejoiced, for the success of your quest would bring about the destruction of Zahda and put an end to the bane that had haunted Dessi for hundreds of years.</p>
    <p>You survived the perils of Castle Death and emerged triumphant, achieving that which the Elder Magi had believed to be impossible. During the victory celebrations held in your honour you learned that for centuries the Elder Magi had been expecting your coming. An ancient Dessi legend tells of the birth and rise to greatness of two <foreign xml:lang="x-dessi">koura-tas-kai</foreign>&emdash;<quote>sons of the sun</quote>. One was named <foreign xml:lang="x-dessi">Ikar</foreign>, which means <quote>eagle</quote>; the other was called <foreign xml:lang="x-dessi">Skarn</foreign>, which means <quote>wolf</quote>. A prophecy foretold that the <foreign xml:lang="x-dessi">koura-tas-kai</foreign> would come from the north to seek the council of the Elder Magi in order that they might fulfil a great quest. Although separated by several centuries, they would share one spirit, one purpose and one destiny&emdash;to triumph over the champions of darkness in an age of great peril.</p>
    <p>At the Temple of Truth in Elzian, the magnificent capital city of Dessi, the Elder Magi prepared you for the next stage of the Magnakai quest. Lord Rimoah, the speaker of the High Council, tutored you in the ancient histories of Magnamund, and you received lessons in lore that you would have learned from the Kai Masters if only they had survived the attack by the murderous Darklords of Helgedad.</p>
    <p>The Lorestone you must find now lies hidden in a temple in the centre of a jungle-swamp known as the Danarg. In ancient times this huge area, once the crater of a massive volcano, was controlled by a powerful lord of evil called Agarash the Damned. The Elder Magi defeated him in a war that lasted one thousand years and, in the wake of his destruction, they turned the Danarg crater into a rich and fertile paradise, the perfect setting for their most sacred place of worship&emdash;the Temple of Ohrido. The Danarg flourished until a great plague befell the Elder Magi and decimated their race. They were forced to abandon the Danarg and seek refuge in Dessi. Slowly the Danarg was consumed by a creeping mire, which swallowed or poisoned all healthy forms of life. The crater became a sanctuary for a host of evil creatures who thrived in the fetid waters and fought for control of the treacherous shifting mud flats. Many came from the barren hills of Ogia, but many more awoke from lairs deep beneath the crater where they had lain dormant since the defeat of their master, Agarash the Damned, eight thousand years ago.</p>
    <p>Now the time for study has passed and the time for swift action has arrived. Grim news from the west prompts the Elder Magi to cease their counselling and arrange for your immediate passage to the Danarg. In the Darklord city of Helgedad a civil war has raged for five years following your defeat of Haakon, Archlord of the Black City. Now, a new lord sits upon the throne of Helgedad&emdash;Darklord Gnaag of Mozg&ocirc;ar.</p>
    <p><quote>The Darklords are united behind their new leader,</quote> reports Lord Rimoah solemnly to his fellow elders of the High Council. <quote>And they are hungry for conquest and revenge. Their strength grows with each passing day. We dare delay no longer.</quote></p>
    <p>Silently the members of the High Council rise from their seats and turn to face you. No sounds reach your ears, yet the words of their blessing fill your mind.</p>
    <p><quote>May the gods Ishir and Kai protect you on your journey into darkness, <foreign xml:lang="x-dessi">Kor-Skarn</foreign>,</quote> they intone.</p>

    <p>You keep a record of your adventure on the <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
    <p>During your training as a Kai Master you have developed fighting prowess&emdash;<typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ>&emdash;and physical stamina&emdash;<typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ>. Before you set off on your adventure you need to measure how effective your training has been. To do this take a pencil and, with your eyes closed, point with the blunt end of it on to the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a>. If you pick 0 it counts as zero.</p>
    <p>The first number that you pick from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> in this way represents your <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ>. Add 10 to the number you picked and write the total in the <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> section of your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>. (I.e. if your pencil fell on the number 4 in the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> you would write in a <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> of 14.) When you fight, your <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> will be pitted against that of your enemy. A high score in this section is therefore very desirable.</p>
    <p>The second number that you pick from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> represents your powers of <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ>. Add 20 to this number and write the total in the <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> section of your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>. (I.e. if your pencil fell on the number 6 on the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> you would have 26 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points.)</p>
    <p>If you are wounded in combat you will lose <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points. If at any time your <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points fall to zero, you are dead and the adventure is over. Lost <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points can be regained during the course of the adventure, but your number of <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points can never rise above the number you started with.</p>
    <p><strong>If you have successfully completed any of the previous adventures in the Lone Wolf Series</strong>, you can carry your current scores of <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> and <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points over to Book 8. You may also carry over any Weapons and Special Items you have in your possession at the end of your last adventure, and these should be entered on your new <a idref="action">Action Chart</a> (you are still limited to two Weapons and eight Backpack Items).</p>
    <p>You may choose one bonus <a idref="discplnz">Magnakai Discipline</a> to add to your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a> for every Lone Wolf Magnakai adventure you successfully complete (books 6&endash;12).</p>

      <p>During your training as a Kai Lord, and in the course of the adventures that led to the discovery of <cite>The Book of the Magnakai</cite>, you have mastered all ten of the basic warrior skills known as the Kai Disciplines.</p>
      <p>After studying <cite>The Book of the Magnakai</cite>, you have also reached the rank of Kai Master Superior, which means that you have learnt <em>three</em> of the Magnakai Disciplines listed below. It is up to you to choose which three skills these are. As all of the Magnakai Disciplines will be of use to you at some point on your adventure, pick your three with care. The correct use of a Magnakai Discipline at the right time can save your life.</p>
      <p>The Magnakai skills are divided into groups, each of which is governed by a separate school of training. These groups are called <quote>Lore-circles</quote>. By mastering all of the Magnakai Disciplines in a particular Lore-circle, you can gain an increase in your <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> and <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points score. (See <quote><a idref="lorecrcl">Lore-circles of the Magnakai</a></quote> for details of these bonuses.)</p>
      <p>When you have chosen your three Magnakai Disciplines, enter them in the Magnakai Disciplines section of your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>.</p>

        <p>This Magnakai Discipline enables a Kai Master to become proficient in the use of all types of weapon. When you enter combat with a weapon you have mastered, you add 3 points to your <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ>. The rank of Kai Master Superior, with which you begin the Magnakai series, means you are skilled in <em>three</em> of the weapons in the list below.</p>

        <p>The fact that you are skilled with three weapons does not mean that you begin the adventure carrying any of them.

        <p>If you choose this skill, write <quote>Weaponmastery: +3 <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> points</quote> on your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>, and tick your chosen weapons on the weapons list that appears on your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>.

        <p>It is a powerful Discipline, but it is also a costly one. For every round of combat in which you use Psi-surge, you must deduct 2 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points. A weaker form of Psi-surge called Mindblast can be used against an enemy without losing any <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points, but it will add only 2 extra points to your <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ>. Psi-surge cannot be used if your <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> falls to 6 points or below, and not all of the creatures encountered on your adventure will be affected by it; you will be told if a creature is immune.</p>

      <p>Before leaving Dessi on your journey to the Danarg, the Elder Magi give you a <a idref="map">map of the jungle-swamp</a> and its surrounding lands, and a pouch of gold. To find out how much gold is in the pouch, pick a number from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a>. Add 10 to the number you have picked. The total equals the number of Gold Crowns inside the pouch, and you should now enter this number in the <quote>Gold Crowns</quote> section of your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>. If you have successfully completed books 1&endash;7 of the Lone Wolf adventures, you may add this sum to the total sum of Crowns you already possess. You can carry a maximum of only fifty Crowns, but additional Crowns can be left in safekeeping at your Kai monastery.</p>
      <p>The Elder Magi offer you a choice of equipment to aid you on your perilous mission. You can take five items from the list below, again adding to these, if necessary, any you may already possess. However, remember that you can carry a maximum of two Weapons and eight Backpack Items.</p>

      <p>There will be occasions during your adventure when you have to fight an enemy. The enemy&apos;s <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> and <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points are given in the text. Lone Wolf&apos;s aim in the combat is to kill the enemy by reducing his <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points to zero while losing as few <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points as possible himself.</p>
      <p>At the start of a combat, enter Lone Wolf&apos;s and the enemy&apos;s <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points in the appropriate boxes on the Combat Record section of your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
      <p>The sequence for combat is as follows:</p>
      <ol class="paragraphed">
       <li><p>Add any extra points gained through your Magnakai Disciplines and Special Items to your current <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> total.</p></li>
       <li>
        <p>Subtract the <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> of your enemy from this total. The result is your Combat Ratio. Enter it on the <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
        <p>Example</p>
        <p>Lone Wolf (<typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> 15) is attacked by a Nightstalker (<typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> 22). He is not given the opportunity to evade combat but must stand and fight as the creature leaps on him. Lone Wolf has the Magnakai Discipline of Psi-surge to which the Nightstalker is not immune, so Lone Wolf adds 4 points to his <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ>, giving a total <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> of 19.</p>
        <p>He subtracts the Nightstalker&apos;s <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> from his own, giving a Combat Ratio of &minus;3. (19 &minus; 22 = &minus;3). &minus;3 is noted on the <a idref="action">Action Chart</a> as the Combat Ratio.</p>
       </li>
       <li><p><a id="stage3">When you have your Combat Ratio</a>, pick a number from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a>.</p></li>
       <li>
        <p>Turn to the <a idref="crtable">Combat Results Table</a>. Along the top of the chart are shown the Combat Ratio numbers. Find the number that is the same as your Combat Ratio and cross-reference it with the random number that you have picked (the random numbers appear on the side of the chart). You now have the number of <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points lost by both Lone Wolf and his enemy in this round of combat. (E represents points lost by the enemy; LW represents points lost by Lone Wolf.)</p>
        <p>Example</p>
        <p>The Combat Ratio between Lone Wolf and the Nightstalker has been established as &minus;3. If the number taken from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> is a 6, then the result of the first round of combat is:</p>
        <ul>
         <li>Lone Wolf loses 3 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points (plus an additional 2 points for using Psi-surge)</li>
         <li>Nightstalker loses 6 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points</li>
        </ul>
       </li>
       <li><p>On the <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>, mark the changes in <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points to the participants in the combat.</p></li>
       <li><p>Unless otherwise instructed, or unless you have an option to evade, the next round of combat now starts.</p></li>
       <li><p>Repeat the sequence from <a idref="stage3">Stage 3</a>.</p></li>
      </ol>
      <p>This process of combat continues until the <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points of either the enemy or Lone Wolf are reduced to zero, at which point the one with the zero score is declared dead. If Lone Wolf is dead, the adventure is over. If the enemy is dead, Lone Wolf proceeds but with his <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points reduced.</p>

        <p>During your adventure you may be given the chance to evade combat. If you have already engaged in a round of combat and decide to evade, calculate the combat for that round in the usual manner.

Only Lone Wolf may lose <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points during that round, but then that is the risk of running away!

      <p>In the years before their massacre, the Kai Masters of Sommerlund devoted themselves to the study of the Magnakai. These skills were divided into four schools of training called <quote>Lore-circles</quote>. By mastering all of the Magnakai Disciplines of a Lore-circle, the Kai Masters developed their fighting prowess (<typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ>), and their physical and mental stamina (<typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ>) to a level far higher than any mortal warrior could otherwise attain.</p>
      <p>Listed below are the four Lore-circles of the Magnakai and the skills that must be mastered in order to complete them.</p>

         <dt>Curing</dt>
          <dd>Primates with this skill will have the ability to delay the effect of poisons, including venoms, that they may come into contact with.

          <dd>Primates with the Magnakai Discipline of Psi-surge will, by concentrating their psychic powers upon an object, be able to set up vibrations that may lead to the disruption or destruction of the object.</dd>

    <p>The quest for the Lorestone of Ohrido will be fraught with danger, for the temple in which it lies is situated deep within the Danarg. Make notes as you progress through the story&emdash;they will be of great help in this and future adventures.</p>
    <p>Many things that you find will help you during your adventure. Some Special Items will be of use in future Lone Wolf adventures and others may be red herrings of no real use at all, so be selective in what you decide to keep.</p>
    <p>Choose your three Magnakai Disciplines with care, for a wise choice enables any player to complete the quest, no matter how weak his initial <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> and <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points scores. Successful completion of previous Lone Wolf adventures, although an advantage, is not essential for the completion of this Magnakai adventure.</p>
    <p>May the spirit of your ancestors guide you on the path of the Magnakai.</p>
    <p>Good luck!</p>

      <p>You leave Elzian under cover of darkness on a trading ship bound for Garthen. It is a trim vessel, lean-prowed and simple in design&emdash;one of a thousand such ships that sail the chain of land-locked seas and lakes dividing the northern and southern continents of Magnamund. Its passage along this great waterway called the Tentarias is unlikely to invite undue attention, and it is for this reason that the Elder Magi have placed you aboard. The nature of your voyage is secret, but you are not alone, for a guide has been chosen to accompany you on your dangerous mission. His name is Paido, a tall, ebony-skinned Vakeros, who is a master of the art of battle-magic. Among his fellow warriors he is a high-ranking lord, respected and honoured for his bravery and skill on the field of battle. Now, for the mission that lies ahead, he has exchanged his gold and scarlet robes for the clothes of a commoner, a roving adventurer with a sword for hire. It is a disguise you too have adopted to veil your true identity on the long voyage to the land of Talestria, where a rendezvous with royalty awaits you.</p>
      <p>You sail westwards, a benevolent wind filling the triangular sail and skimming the ship across the still, blue waters. The hull seems to slide over the surface of the water rather than cut its way through, and you cannot help but wonder if Paido has conjured some magic to speed your passage. Your first port of call is the city of Talon, where food stocks and fresh water are replenished. Then the voyage continues along the Tentarias to the port of Orello, the last stopping place before your ship-bound journey ends at Garthen&emdash;crown capital of Talestria.</p>
      <p>It is an hour past midnight when you dock at Varnos harbour in Garthen, a sprawling network of quays and cracked stone jetties that shelter great fleets of merchants, traders and dhows. Silently like a shadow, you disembark and follow Paido through the twisting harbour streets, slowly climbing the steep stairs that connect one level of Garthen to the next. Rusty lanterns cast pools of yellow light beneath the timbered balconies, illuminating the stalls of merchants and vendors who will haggle, brag and barter in the crowded streets till dawn. Paido halts at an iron-shod door and raps the grille with the hilt of his blue-steel sword. A man&apos;s face appears, stern and handsome, with smooth dark hair and keen, intelligent eyes. A smile of recognition softens his lordly features when he sees Paido. In an instant the door swings open and you are ushered inside.</p>
      <p>The man&apos;s name is Adamas, Lord Constable of the Royal Citadel, protector and cousin of Queen Evaine of Talestria. For centuries a strong bond of friendship has existed between the royal household and the magicians of Dessi, and when called upon by the Elder Magi to help you in your quest, Queen Evaine pledged her support without hesitation. She has volunteered the services of Lord Adamas, who is to ensure your safe and unhindered passage through Talestria to the borders of the Danarg. At dawn, after snatching a few hours&apos; sleep, you are taken by coach to the east city wharf, where an empty corn barge is waiting to ferry you up-river. Haulage is provided by eight large ghorkas&emdash;hairy, ox-like creatures from the plains of Slovia&emdash;which are harnessed to the barge by chains. They lumber along the cobbled towpath, continually kept in line by the stinging lash of the barge owner&apos;s zull-hide whip. The next day the barge arrives at a small river village called Lona, where a detachment of Lord Adamas&apos; cavalry, resplendent in surcoats of scarlet and grey, provide you with horses for the cross-country journey to the fortified city of Phoena.</p>
      <p>Ill news greets you in Phoena, the city of triple towers. Zegron, warlord of Xanar, ruler of the barren highlands of Ogia, has amassed an army of Drakkarim warriors. Three days ago they attacked the border town of Luukos to the north. The Talestrian garrison put up a brave and spirited defence, but they were hopelessly outnumbered by the bloodthirsty Ogian horde that drove through the perimeter walls with battering rams and engines of war. The Drakkarim razed Luukos to the ground, and only a handful of survivors escaped to tell of the dreadful battle.</p>

      <p><quote>The situation is grave,</quote> reports Lord Adamas, on returning from an emergency conclave of his fellow Talestrian knights. <quote>For decades Zegron and his minions have raided our northern territories, but never before with such determination and strength. We must mobilize our army for war, for it is war that Ogia has invited by its unforgivable attack on Luukos. I must return to Garthen to muster my retainers in preparation for battle and inform the Queen of the evil that threatens her realm. I can no longer escort you to the Danarg, though your quest must proceed in spite of all that conspires against it.</quote></p>

      <p>Early next morning Lord Adamas accompanies you and Paido to the main square of Phoena; it is from here that your quest begins. The first leg of your journey to the Danarg will take you north to the town of Tharro which nestles in the fertile uplands of Talestria.

        <p>The original text reads <quote>If the combat lasts more than five rounds&ellips;</quote> This would leave you no option if the fight lasts exactly five rounds. We reasoned that the most likely interpretation is that the author intended the second choice to be taken if the combat last five rounds or more. However, it is also possible that he intended for it to read "If you win the combat in five rounds or less&ellips; If the combat lasts more than five rounds," in which case would you get one more round to fight before going to <a idref="sect158">Section 158</a>.</p>
       <p>This section is very problematic for a player just starting their adventures from this book. It is actually impossible to kill both Vordaks in time if your <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> is too low. According to a strict interpretation of the text, this combat must be won in four rounds or less. To find the probability of success in this combat, we counted the number of four digit combinations of numbers picked from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> that kill both Vordaks, divided by 10,000 (the total number of four digit possibilities). For example, a 0.03&percent; chance of success for an initial <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> of 14, reflects that only 3 combinations of random number picks (in this case, 0-0-0-0, 0-0-0-9, and 0-0-9-0) out of a possible 10,000 are capable of defeating both Vordaks in time. <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points are a non-issue in this case since no combination which destroys both creatures in time will also deduct 20 or more <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points from Lone Wolf. All of the probabilities given assume that Lone Wolf has chosen Disciplines most advantageous to his <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> for this battle&emdash;Weaponmastery with an appropriate Weapon in his possession, Psi-surge, and Psi-screen&emdash;as well as saved the one potion of Alether found in this adventure for this battle, for a total of 9 points above the initial <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> score.</p>

      <p>Along the track a great procession of men, women children come towards you, some on horseback, some in carts, and some with bundles of possessions clutched to their soot-blackened chests. They stumble forward in silence, their eyes filled with terror and despair.</p>

      <p>Tadia raises her arms and points towards the sky. Floating in the air between her parted hands appears a spinning globe of white fire.

      <p>You leap from the saddle, narrowly avoiding being pulled off the tree-bridge. Your horse and the hideous creature both disappear from view, quickly swallowed up by the spray from the waterfall. As you land on the slippery wet wood, Paido&apos;s horse rears up on its hind legs, its forelegs kicking the air and its eyes rolling madly. He fights to control the animal but it is wild with fear and, with a crack of splintering wood, its hind hoof shears through a rotten branch; it totters on the brink. Paido swings his legs clear and abandons his doomed horse barely seconds before it falls into the watery abyss.</p>

      <p>Unhurriedly, you leave your seat and walk to the tap-room stairs. When you are in position your companions rise and advance towards the stranger who remains motionless, seemingly engrossed in his black book. Trost draws his sword and challenges the man, demanding that he state his name and the purpose of his journey. It is a fatal mistake. The man looks up from his book, his grey eyes suddenly aglow with a terrible red fire. Trost screams. His face has become a mass of horrible, erupting boils. As he falls to the floor, Paido strikes, his sword a shimmering lance of blue steel forged by the Elder Magi. His attack is lightning fast, but the necromancer counters his blow on the edge of his blade. Sparks explode, showering the tap-room with glowing fragments. The crowd begins to cheer, but their cheers turn to screams of terror when the necromancer summons a new defence.</p>

Paido wakes and takes over the watch, but the lingering feeling that you are being observed makes you uneasy and disturbs your rest (lose 2 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points). Four hours later, you wake to the gloomy grey of dawn and prepare to set off once more.</p>

      <p>You take cover behind the pulpit and focus your skill on a corner at the far end of the hall. Two hunting dogs run through the curtained archway and stop in the middle of the aisle, as if waiting for their handlers to catch up. Seconds later a group of monks appear, each armed with a sword. They approach the far corner and search it thoroughly, certain that the pews harbour you and your companion. When they discover them empty, they quickly leave the hall and descend the stairs, their baying hounds in tow.</p>

You are both exhausted after the day&apos;s events and agree to stop here to rest. Paido takes a Gold Crown from his pocket and tosses it in the air to decide who should take the first watch. <quote>Heads or tails?</quote> he asks, the Crown clenched in his fist.</p>

      <p><quote>Approach the crystal dais, Lone Wolf,</quote> instructs Paido, pointing to a radiant circular plateau of pure quartz.</p>
      <p>But even as his words leave his lips you are already walking towards the plinth, drawn by a strange compulsion. You mount the dais and a flood of golden light pours down from above, bathing you in its warm, cleansing rays. You raise your cupped hands, as if offering up an invisible gift, and a tingling sensation runs the length of your arms and spreads through your body, giving you an incredible sense of well being. A ball of sparkling light is taking shape in your hands. It condenses into a radiant crystal filled with golden fire: it is the Lorestone of Ohrido.</p>

      <p>A bead of sweat on Paido&apos;s forehead is the first sign of his recovery. Slowly he stirs to consciousness, waking from a sleep that was so nearly his last.

      <p><quote>The servants of Darklord Gnaag have infiltrated this monastery,</quote> you reply. <quote>They have kept themselves hidden, but I fear the day is fast approaching when they will rise up and wreak their havoc.

If Talestria falls to Darklord Gnaag before we reach the Danarg, then the quest is lost.</quote> You nod in agreement, and as you cast your eyes along the gloomy passageway, you cannot help but wonder if the quest is already lost. With a shake of your head you dismiss the thought and help Paido to his feet.</p>
      <p>The passage follows a tortuous path that leads eventually to a panelled door. A raised button activates the lock, and the door slides into the wall to reveal a strange room. Domed and hexagonal, its walls are hung with tapestries depicting strange and grotesque creatures. Numerous plinths stand upon the richly carpeted floor, each supporting a large bowl filled to the brim with a silvery liquid. Cautiously you step through the secret portal and into this sumptuous chamber.</p>

      <p>The archery range is a long and narrow room lit by torches set into the walls at regular intervals. At the far end are three targets bound with wire to bales of hay. Each target is the same size as the one you saw earlier, hanging behind the counter, but instead of rings, they each display the silhouette of a different creature: the left target shows a man; the centre one shows a wolf; and the right target shows a bear. You hand the owner your silver bow and he chooses three arrows from a rack on the wall. He praises the balance and fine workmanship of the bow as he draws the bowstring and takes aim at the centre target.</p>
      <p><quote>Head!</quote> he says, and releases the shaft. The arrow whistles to the target and sinks into the head of the wolf silhouette. <quote>Rump!</quote> he calls on the second shot, shooting the arrow exactly in the target&apos;s hind quarters. <quote>And now for the last,</quote> he says, taking care to load the bow correctly; <quote>the heart of the wolf.</quote></p>
      <p>Suddenly he turns and fires. The arrow comes screaming towards your chest.</p>

      <p>Your sense of time slips away as you trek through the seemingly endless expanse of bleak grey trees. Slowly you become aware that you are on an incline, and as your passage becomes steeper, you notice large outcrops of pitted volcanic rock.</p>
      <p><quote>We&apos;re approaching the Danarg crater,</quote> says Paido, his quietly spoken words echoing loudly through the eerie forest. Suddenly you recall the words of Lord Rimoah during your period of preparation in Elzian: <quote>The Danarg occupies the crater of an ancient and massive volcano. Once it was a lush jungle of fertile vegetation, but now it is a cancerous wound that poisons all who dwell there&ellips;</quote></p>
      <p>By noon you have climbed to the lip of the crater and begun your descent. Gradually the tall, straight trees of the Mordril Forest thin out giving way to twisted trunks and stunted saplings as the land sinks deeper and deeper. Imperceptibly the forest ends and the swamp begins. The ground is softer, and tall, black rushes appear in clumps around misty pools of stagnant water. From tortured husks of trees hang thorny vines, as tough and as cruel as sharpened steel wire. So thickly are they entwined around some trees that they have strangled them, leaving empty coils where the trunks have rotted away. The stench of decay fills your nostrils in the humid yet cold air.</p>

      <p>You are welcomed by an attractive young woman with long, jet-black hair, woven into a single plait that reaches almost to her waist. She is dressed in a green suede-cloth tunic, similar to your own, and wears soft, calf-skin gloves. In addition to the maps, which she researches and draws herself, she also sells all manner of hunting and scouting equipment. She takes an obvious delight in her work and shows you samples of her maps, which are excellent for their accuracy and attention to detail. You ask her if she has ever prepared a map of the Danarg and she turns strangely silent. Tears begin to fill her dark eyes as she recalls how she and her father once explored beyond the fringes of that fearsome domain. They had planned to map its internal waterways and, if luck was with them, discover the lost temple of the Elder Magi. With sadness she tells of her father&apos;s death in the jaws of a monster that had stalked them from the moment they had entered the jungle-swamp. She escaped but not unscathed. As she fought to free her father from the mouth of the beast she was badly burned by its caustic saliva. Carefully she removes one of her calf-skin gloves and reveals an injured hand. The sight of the angry red scar tissue fills you with compassion for this brave young woman.</p>

      <p>The building turns out to be a bowyery, stocked with some of the finest archery equipment you have ever seen. Myriad types of arrows, quivers, bracers, wrist and finger guards, bowstrings and bow cases fill the racks from floor to ceiling. A colourful ringed target hangs on the wall behind the counter, and on it are painted the prices of the goods for sale. You read:</p>

      <p>You may purchase any of the above equipment, using Gold Crowns to pay for the items if you wish (1 Gold Crown = 4 Lune). A quiver holds a maximum of six arrows, and to carry more than six arrows you will need to purchase an extra quiver. Bow cases, finger and wrist guards, and bowstrings are all Backpack Items.</p>

The arrow flies true, but a hapless passenger runs across its path. He screams as the arrow clips his shoulder. It is only a flesh wound, but your shot has been deflected; it sinks harmlessly into the tap-room wall. You curse your bad luck and shoulder your bow in favour of a hand weapon. The necromancer senses the threat you pose and turns to face you, his hands weaving a pattern in the air. Suddenly you are literally frozen in your tracks.

You stop here to rest and dislodge the tiny leeches that are feasting on your legs.</p>
      <p>Paido climbs the tree to scan the horizon. He carries with him a starguider, a homing device invented by the Elder Magi to enable their flying ships to navigate in the dark. It is sensitive to the vibrations of korlinium crystals. The spire of the Temple of Ohrido is solid korlinium, and the Elder Magi have set Paido&apos;s starguider to home in on the vibrations emitted by the spire. By following the direction of these vibrations, you should find the lost temple.</p>
      <p>While Paido is busy adjusting the starguider, you decide to take a closer look at your surroundings.</p>

      <p>The Helghast vents a cry of rage and despair as you strike the blow that seals its doom. It crumples and falls, its flesh transforming into a vile green gas. All that remains is the torn and shredded robe that once concealed its identity.</p>
      <p>Your mind reels at what has just occurred, but you dare not dwell on the fearful implications, for you can make out the sound of feet running down the stairs beyond the locked refectory door. You rush to Paido&apos;s side and shake him, trying desperately to revive him. He groans, his head lolling from side to side as you drag him to his feet. There is now only one escape route from the refectory&emdash;the hatch in the wall that leads to the kitchens. You lift Paido across your shoulder and bundle him through the narrow opening. But, before you can pull yourself through, the door slams open and a rush of monks pour into the refectory.</p>

      <p>One of the bowls begins to emit a faint humming sound. The surface of its silvery liquid swirls and glows brighter, casting a phosphorescent light on to the domed ceiling. The sparkling mist slowly clears and a strange image takes shape, condensing and forming into something wholly alien, something that resembles the head of a monstrous fly. Its great multi-faceted eyes stare down at you, gleaming darkly with black fire, like two huge clusters of evil jewels.</p>

Also, set into the back of the chair, is a lever. It activates a portal in the opposite wall. The tapestry that conceals it is drawn aside, and you can see a stairway, flanked by torches, descending to a passage far below.</p>

      <p>Your ears are filled with a loathsome hissing as the bodies of your slain enemies dissolve into the mud. You stare at their smouldering remains, and a cold chill grips your heart as you speculate on why these foul servants of the Darklords came to this sleepy Talestrian hamlet.</p>
      <p>Inside the abbey you discover the grisly answer. Scattered throughout the chambers and corridors are the bodies of dead monks, their lifeless faces frozen in masks of horror. Several have been stripped of their robes, presumably to provide a disguise for their killers.</p>
      <p><quote>Why would the Darklords want to take control of this abbey?</quote> asks Paido, horrified at the sight of such slaughter.</p>
      <p><quote>I fear it is part of their plan to conquer Talestria,</quote> you reply. <quote>It is always their strategy to infiltrate a land with agents before invading. When invasion is launched, these agents rise up and attack from within.</quote></p>
      <p><quote>So you think that the Darklords plan to invade Talestria,</quote> says Paido, aghast at the possibility of such an event.</p>
      <p><quote>I suspect that their plan is already under way,</quote> you say thoughtfully. <quote>Perhaps the destruction of Luukos was masterminded not in Xanar, but in Helgedad.</quote></p>
      <p>Paido helps you to bury the monks in the graves already dug by their killers. As you cover the last of the bodies with soil you notice a small, pear-shaped stone lying on the pathway. Its speckled blue surface is mirror-smooth and, despite its size, it feels remarkably heavy. You suspect it is very valuable and decide to keep it.

Awkwardly it shuffles upright, on two large hairy paws. At first glance it looks as if two totally separate creatures have been joined together at the waist: the lower half is covered with a coarse, spiky fur, and the upper body is pale and hairless, heavily veined, with long sinewy forearms. It raises its snout to savour the smell of your frightened horse and opens its fanged jaws.</p>

Paido raises his tankard and takes a great mouthful of the ale of his choice&emdash;Ferina Nog. Immediately he spits it out, wiping away its insipid taste on the back of his hand. <quote>Bilge juice!</quote> he splutters, slamming down his mug.</p>
      <p><quote>You should be a sight more careful where you empty your mouth, stranger,</quote> growls a man to your right. He bends down and picks up his polished steel helmet. With a slow and deliberate twist of his wrist he empties it of ale, pouring the contents all over Paido&apos;s feet. Your companion curses and reaches instinctively for his sword.</p>

      <p>The sword whistles past your head and gouges a chunk of stone from the courtyard arch. You hear the monks shouting and you dig in your heels, steering your horse through the archway and along a narrow street that leads to the quadrangle. At this early hour there are few obstacles to slow your escape as you gallop headlong through the twisting streets of Tharro. It is not until you reach the town&apos;s north gate that you finally rein in your horse to a halt.</p>

      <p>It is late afternoon when you see the Temple of Ohrido, rising majestically out of the swamp mists and tangled vegetation. The sight of this towering ziggurat is so breathtaking that you are both stunned into silence as you feast your eyes on its untarnished splendour. Tier upon tier of gleaming white stone, shaped and formed into perfect symmetry, confront you. Huge foundation slabs support a level carved of golden rock, inlaid and decorated with gemstones. Above that sit strata of precious metals and then levels made up of crystal slabs, whose facets refract the colours of the rainbow. Upward climb tiers of ruby, sapphire and emerald, that offer up a wedge-shaped spire of pure korlinium crystal to the sky.</p>
      <p>At its base the swamp has shrunk back as if repelled by the radiant goodness of the temple. A perimeter of lush grass leads to a staircase of solid amber. You follow Paido as he ascends towards a pair of huge triangular doors set into the second level. Everywhere the glitter of gemstones and the gleam of precious metals radiate a purity unspoiled by the Danarg. Paido completes the complex procedures that open the great doors, taught to him by the Elder Magi in preparation for this mission. They part and you enter, stepping on a floor of glistening gold, a floor that has lain undisturbed for seven thousand years.</p>

      <p>You spend a cold, wet, and thoroughly miserable night on the plain south of Tharro. A fresh storm rolls in from the west making it impossible to light a fire or dry your already damp clothing.

You must now eat a Meal or lose an additional 3 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points.</p>
      <p>The garrison of Tharro still refuses to allow you into the town, so you are forced to set off towards a line of distant hills that fill the northern horizon. Grey-brown grasses brush your shins as you cross this wild, uncultivated plain, encroaching on the deserted track that leads to the frontier town of Syada. An eerie, unnatural silence accompanies your ride, broken only by the rare cawing of ravens, circling high overhead.</p>
      <p>By midday you are deep among the hills. The terrain becomes increasingly rocky, undulating like a storm-tossed ocean. The tall plains grass has given way to sad little plants, scraggy and deformed, stunted by the winds that sweep down from the barren wastes of Ogia. The track passes through a narrow valley, where a small stone cabin stands beside the entrance to a disused mine. As you approach you see a face at the cabin window.</p>

It is solid korlinium. At the centre of the chamber, its hull resting on a cradle of steel, is a Levitron&emdash;an ancient skyship. Like everything else that you have seen in this wondrous temple, the craft is untarnished by time. Paido ushers you aboard and prepares to power the craft. A shudder runs through the hull as the engines rise in pitch and slowly it lifts from its bed of steel. The chamber is built in the spire of the temple and the roof now slides open to allow the Levitron to rise into the darkening sky above the Danarg.</p>

      <p>The track winds through the centre of the valley, following the course of a stream that meanders towards the River Phoen. It flows alongside a white-brick house, turning its waterwheel with a comforting, regular sound. As you ride past the house and over a tiny, hump-backed bridge, a cluster of cottages and an abbey come into view. In the grounds of the abbey a burial is taking place. A circle of monks dressed in hooded brown robes are lowering a coffin into one of several freshly dug graves.</p>

      <p>The heavy rain and the burial have delayed the journey. The bargees try to make up lost time by whipping the ghorkas, but to no avail. The muddy towpath and their waterlogged fur prevent them from pulling any faster. It is mid-afternoon by the time the barge arrives at the next stopping place&emdash;Ferry House. A ramshackle building is perched precariously on the edge of the river bank, and an old wooden jetty juts out from the side, its empty platform almost submerged by the swollen river. Two plains farmers disembark here. You hear them talking excitedly about the events they have witnessed, their voices gradually fading as the barge moves forward again.</p>

      <p>The stairs lead down to a vast network of catacombs that stretch in every direction. It would be easy to lose yourself in this maze of tunnels, but your Kai tracking skills, heightened by the pressing need to escape from the monastery, help you avoid the hazards and dead ends of these sprawling burial vaults. Following the sound of dripping water, you discover a circular stone trapdoor in the ceiling. Paido cups his hands around your foot and lifts you nearer the tunnel roof, enabling you to open the trapdoor. Early morning daylight streams into the passage as you lift the slab of wet stone and slide it aside.</p>
      <p>You have emerged at the courtyard on the north side of the monastery. Two monks stand guard at the double doors of a low, timber-framed building on the other side of the paved enclosure. Fortunately a line of bushy fruit trees that encircles the courtyard provide all the cover you need to avoid their watchful eyes. You crouch in the shadows and watch as the monks leave their posts to enter the building. Minutes later the doors swing open and they reappear, both on horseback, and ride off through an archway to the right. The courtyard is now empty but you curse their departure, for the horses they are riding belong to you and Paido.</p>

Its surface is a gossamer-thin membrane, and it hides the egg-like Korkuna which has burrowed beneath it. As you touch the surface, the edges of the membrane roll inwards and smother your hand, holding you fast in a steel grip. A snaky tendril lashes out from a hole in the shell and wraps itself around your throat, its sharp tip piercing your neck. You are paralysed; you cannot move. Horror fills your senses as you watch helplessly as the creature gorges on your blood, its shell pulsating and swelling.</p>

      <p>Paido screams for your help. A swooping Kraan-rider has cast a large net, smothering his body. The net is sewn with hundreds of tiny barbed hooks which have worked their way into his skin and clothes, and he cannot free himself without the hooks inflicting fearful wounds. Only one Vordak remains to confront him, all the others having perished on his blade, but he is now unable to defend himself against this creature. He is at the mercy of a merciless foe.</p>
      <p>You scramble to your feet and rush to save him as the Vordak creeps closer. Suddenly the Kraan-rider reappears, gliding low across the deck before hovering over the bow. A length of thin black rope dangles from its saddle and hurriedly the Vordak threads it through the corners of the net. You race up the steps, shouting <quote>For Sommerlund</quote> and launch your attack. The Vordak turns to face you, its skeletal features frozen in a mask of terror. An instant later your weapon shears its bony neck and sends its skull-like head spinning down into the Danarg. A ghastly cry pierces your ears, but it is not a shriek of pain or despair: it is a malicious caw of triumph. The Kraan beats its massive wings, and the down-draught forces you to your knees as the creature climbs higher into the darkening sky. You stare aghast as the rope closes the net around Paido and lifts him off the deck. Instinctively you leap upwards, your hands outstretched to grab the barbed net, but it is too late. The Kraan turns in mid-air and flies off to the north with Paido, wounded and helpless, swinging like a netted fish below its leathery black belly.</p>

They stop and sniff the air, whining like hungry pups, frustrated and confused by their conflicting senses. You change your command and will them to attack their masters.

The leading monks throw up their hands in horror and fall against those behind as the dogs leap on them, biting and clawing at their throats. This unexpected attack throws the monks into a panic.

      <p>You empty the tankard in one go and wipe the froth from your lips. Seconds later the floor of the hold begins to rock from side to side, gently at first, but gathering momentum until you are forced to cling to the table to prevent yourself from falling over. The other passengers seem unaffected by the violent pitching and rolling, as if their feet were nailed to the deck. You shout a warning that the barge is about to sink, that they should try to save themselves before it is too late. They cackle and sneer at your concern for their safety, their faces growing larger and more grotesque and the sound of their laughter building to a deafening crescendo. A man in a red coat looms before you, his face twisted and deformed. He grabs your shoulders and you feel his fingers sink painlessly into your flesh. Recoiling in horror, you draw a hand weapon to defend yourself from this frightening apparition. As you step forward to strike a blow, a wave of giddiness robs you of all balance and you crash headlong to the floor.</p>

      <p>The whistle of your arrow can be heard above the rumbling hoofbeats of the approaching cavalry. It flies straight and true, tearing through the chainmail links that protect the leader&apos;s throat. The sudden pain makes him snatch at his reins, and his horse falters, stumbles, then falls. The wounded leader is flung forward over the horse&apos;s head, and he crashes into the ground with a sickening crunch. With their leader slain, the morale of the other men is badly shaken. They break off their ambush, wheeling their horses about and galloping away in disorder.</p>

Expertly, you manage to steer them down a steep bank of loose shale, and then on at a brisk pace along a dried-out gully.

Books and charts, stacked high on shelves and scattered about the floor, fill the room which is illuminated by daylight streaming through a domed portal in the ceiling. A massive bronze telescope is fixed to the portal and below it rests a circular table of carved bone set with gems. Seated at the table is a beautiful young woman. Her hair is silken gold, and around her high, pale forehead she wears a circlet of jet inlaid with runes and mystic symbols.</p>

It follows a tortuous route through the tall plants, around mossy mounds full of crawling insects, past the dark entrances to underground warrens, and skirts the fringe of a thicket of trees. Paido halts and crouches down, ignoring the bloated spiders that scuttle around his knees, and points through a gap in the trees to a settlement of crudely made huts.

You watch with horror as both horses fall headlong into the watery abyss. Paido leaps from his mount as it falls, grabbing hold of the edge of the splintered wood, but it is wet and you can see his fingers slipping.

      <p>You take a bottle from the rack, crack it open against the wall and tip the Laumspur into the remaining wine. Carefully you tilt back Paido&apos;s head and pour the mixture into his open mouth, a drop at a time: in his comatose state he is unable to cough and it would be easy to fill his lungs by accident. It is a slow and painstaking process, which takes you hours to complete.</p>
      <p>It is dawn of the following day before you know for sure if you have saved his life.</p>

      <p>Anger and frustration well up inside you as helplessly you watch the Kraan and your captured companion disappear beyond the horizon. Gradually your anger gives way to sadness as you ponder his fate and wonder if he will ever survive this cruel abduction. You pray for his safety, calling on the spirits of your ancestors to watch over and protect him and, as if in answer to your prayer, you feel a sudden calm engulf your senses. The power of the Lorestone, transfused into your being the instant it appeared in your hands, has greatly increased your intellect and awareness. With confidence you know that Paido will survive his ordeal and that one day you will meet and fight again, side by side.</p>
      <p>The return voyage to Dessi is a swift but lonely journey. The starguider ensures that the Levitron stays on course for Elzian and as you cross the canal which encircles the city, a pilot skyship arrives to escort you down. During the voyage you have discovered how to control the Levitron, and now, as slowly you approach the landing platform of the Tower of Truth, you disengage the starguider and make a faultless landing. Lord Rimoah and the High Council have gathered to greet your return, and upon hearing of your successful quest their hopes for the future are renewed in spite of the sad news of Lord Paido&apos;s capture by agents of the Darklords.</p>
      <p>The High Council listens avidly as you recall your treacherous journey through Talestria, the perilous trek across the Danarg, and the wondrous discovery of their lost temple. When finally you have completed your account they applaud and pay tribute to your courage and daring, their faces beaming with pride. But, despite their joyous greeting, you sense that something is wrong; they seem distant, as if their minds were preoccupied with the solving of a difficult and perplexing problem.</p>
      <p>You ask Lord Rimoah if all is well, and he replies: <quote>You have grown in perception, Lone Wolf. Many things have occurred since last we spoke, and although your quest for the Lorestone of Ohrido has succeeded, the peril of our age has grown ever more deadly. The Darklords now wage open war throughout Magnamund, and many lands have fallen before their Giak legions. Talestria has been overrun. So too have the Stornland nations. Sommerlund stands firm against the armies of Darklord Gnaag, but she has lost her southern province of Ruanon.</quote></p>
      <p>This shocking news fills you with an urge to return to your homeland, yet to do so would defeat the Magnakai quest.</p>
      <p>Lord Rimoah bids you follow him to the chamber of the High Council. Set into the floor is a circular well, brimming with a silvery liquid metal. Rimoah kneels and touches the surface and slowly a vision takes form within the shimmering depths of the pool: it is a fortified city surrounded by rolling hills. <quote>You look upon the city of Tahou in the land of Anari,</quote> says Rimoah, his voice now solemn and composed. <quote>The Lorestone you must find next lies deep below its streets, in an ancient city that was built during the dawn of Magnamund.</quote></p>
      <p>The vision of Tahou heralds the start of a new and perilous episode in your quest for the Magnakai. If you possess the bravery and courage of a true Kai Master, the challenge of Tahou awaits you in Book 9 of the Lone Wolf series entitled:</p>

    <p>(<a idref="sect1">Section 1</a>) Many sections in the book assume that you haven&apos;t discarded the Pass. It is advisable that you don't discard it during this adventure.</p>
    <p>(<a idref="sect13">Section 13</a>) Note that in this combat, you are meant to go to <a idref="sect158">Section 158</a> immediately when the fight reaches the specified number of rounds: do not finish the combat first.</p>
    <p>The original text reads <quote>If the combat lasts more than five rounds&ellips;</quote> This would leave you no option if the fight lasts exactly five rounds. We reasoned that the most likely interpretation is that the author intended the second choice to be taken if the combat last five rounds or more. However, it is also possible that he intended for it to read "If you win the combat in five rounds or less&ellips; If the combat lasts more than five rounds," in which case would you get one more round to fight before going to <a idref="sect158">Section 158</a>.</p>
    <p>This section is very problematic for a player just starting their adventures from this book. It is actually impossible to kill both Vordaks in time if your <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> is too low. According to a strict interpretation of the text, this combat must be won in four rounds or less. To find the probability of success in this combat, we counted the number of four digit combinations of numbers picked from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> that kill both Vordaks, divided by 10,000 (the total number of four digit possibilities). For example, a 0.03&percent; chance of success for an initial <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> of 14, reflects that only 3 combinations of random number picks (in this case, 0-0-0-0, 0-0-0-9, and 0-0-9-0) out of a possible 10,000 are capable of defeating both Vordaks in time. <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points are a non-issue in this case since no combination which destroys both creatures in time will also deduct 20 or more <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points from Lone Wolf. All of the probabilities given assume that Lone Wolf has chosen Disciplines most advantageous to his <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> for this battle&emdash;Weaponmastery with an appropriate Weapon in his possession, Psi-surge, and Psi-screen&emdash;as well as saved the one potion of Alether found in this adventure for this battle, for a total of 9 points above the initial <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> score.</p>

    <p>A player starting from this adventure with 10-13 as her or his initial <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> cannot survive this battle and thus cannot complete the adventure. New players with a higher initial <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> still have a slim chance of completing this adventure.</p>
    <p>(<a idref="sect28">Section 28</a>) The original text didn&apos;t allow for any bonuses to be added to the randomly picked number. We switched the choices to allow for this. If you&apos;d rather play without bonuses, <a idref="sect125">go to 125</a> if you pick 0&endash;4 and <a idref="sect38">go to 38</a> otherwise.</p>
    <p>(<a idref="sect30">Section 30</a>) It seems peculiar that you are instructed to reduce <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> at the beginning of every round if you do not have Psi-screen. This loss would be cumulative so that during the first round you fight with 2 fewer <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> points, the second round with 4 fewer points, the third with 6 fewer, etc. This loss is certainly intended to be for the duration of this Combat only&emdash;not permanently&emdash;since Joe Dever always makes special note of instances where you permanently lose <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ>. It is possible that this penalty is an error, and that you are meant to lose 2 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points rather than <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> points at the beginning of every round.</p>
    <p>(<a idref="sect42">Section 42</a>) If you are infected with the korovax bacillus, you may now use the Tincture of Oxydine to cure yourself.</p>

    <p>(<a idref="sect76">Section 76</a>) <a idref="sect221">Section 221</a> gives you further information about these monks. It is most likely the author&apos;s mistake that you miss this information in lieu of the discovery you make by using Divination in this section. At your discretion <a idref="sect221">go to 221</a> before making your choice in this section.</p>
    <p>(<a idref="sect86">Section 86</a>) It seems unreasonable to lose zero <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points after getting hit by a sword. You may choose to interpret picking <quote>0</quote> as indicating a 10 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> point loss. Other adventures sometimes instruct you to interpret a <quote>0</quote> this way in similar situations.</p>
