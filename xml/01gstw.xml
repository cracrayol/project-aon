     <p>Ancient days they were when first the Shianti set foot upon the land that men call Magnamund. Long had they journeyed through the void, homeless wanderers in search of a place to call their own. And so it was that when the Shianti first looked upon the face of the land, their hearts were raised in wonder. They saw a world of nameless mountains, untamed forests and lands both wild and free. Here they chose to cease their wanderings and to devote themselves to the study and appreciation of this new-found land.</p>
     <p>To the delight of the Shianti, the race of man first emerged at this time and they watched his early struggle towards civilization with eager concern. Like gods the Shianti seemed to the minds of primitive men. Tall and proud, shining with a radiance that spoke of magic and arcane mystery, the Shianti moved among them and with their powers of wizardry, aided man in his development.</p>
     <p>As the centuries passed, man fell to worship of the magical Shianti and the power of these wizards grew even stronger. With hungry hearts they sought to unlock the mysteries of knowledge, sending their minds into other planes of existence and strange worlds beyond the sphere of the material plane. Their foresight was now unmatched and the power of their thought was mighty indeed. It was at this time that they created the Moonstone. Woven of the very fabric of the astral plane of Daziarn, this translucent gem was the greatest achievement of Shianti wisdom. It was the binding force of all Shianti magic, containing the combined might of all their wizardry, the sum of all their knowledge. The Golden Age of the Shianti had come and the Moonstone was the instrument of their dominion throughout all Magnamund. Man stood as little more than a shadow, blinded by the shining white light of Shianti glory. But, in creating the Moonstone, the unwritten laws of nature had been transgressed. For the Moonstone, like the Shianti themselves, was something outside of man&apos;s own world; it defied the natural order laid down by the creators of the Magnamund and disrupted the balance that the gods had designed.</p>
     <p>The Goddess Ishir, High Priestess of the Moon and mother of all men, showed herself to the Shianti and spoke to them of the destiny of man: <quote>The children of this world must claim their inheritance. Their time has come and they must learn to stand alone. They are lost in their worship of you and the day draws ever nearer when they will covet the power of the Moonstone.</quote></p>
     <p>And the Shianti said: <quote>Forgive us, Great Goddess, for we intended no harm. We love mankind even as you do. We have sought to do good and protect your children from harm.</quote></p>
     <p>But Ishir replied, <quote>Of this there can be no doubt, but this world is not your realm. Man must be free to pursue his destiny alone, and you must leave, for you trespass on his domain.</quote></p>
     <p>The Shianti were filled with sorrow. They feared a return to the void and to their lonely wandering, and pleaded with Ishir that she might allow them to remain. Ishir was filled with pity for them. She spoke again, saying, <quote>If you are to remain, you must obey my command. You must take a vow never to interfere with mankind&apos;s fate. As a token of good faith you must lay aside the Moonstone, and return it to the plane where it belongs.</quote></p>
     <p>Solemnly, the Shianti agreed. The vow was sworn before Ishir, and the Moonstone was returned to the Daziarn. The Shianti then moved south to the Isle of Lorn. They encircled their new home with a web of enchantments, magical mists and mage winds to prevent man from ever finding their place of refuge in the Sea of Dreams. Knowledge of the Shianti faded with time, save in southern Magnamund where it became enshrined in legend, and the worship of them endured. Priests of the Shianti religion preserved their teachings and patiently awaited the day when the <quote>ancient ones</quote> would return, bringing with them lasting peace and the blessing of a new golden age.</p>
     <p>Two thousand years strode by and man advanced as Ishir had foretold. He built great cities and cultivated the land; his kingdoms rose and fell; he made war and loved and laughed and became master of his fate. But a new power was emerging in the province of Shadaki. There Shasarak the evil Wytch-king ruled. The black necromancer commanded an army of brutal soldiers and had a devoted following of men who upheld his religion of demonic worship and sacrificial rites. Devotees of the Shianti and other religious cults were persecuted in a merciless purge. Ruthlessly, the Wytch-king destroyed all his opponents and began a terrible war with the peoples of the neighbouring provinces. From the ruins of war Shasarak shaped the Shadakine Empire, subjugating whole nations to his evil rule. As the provinces fell to his might, the Shianti looked on helplessly, bound by their vow to the Goddess Ishir never to interfere in the affairs of man.</p>
     <p>On the night of the crowning of Shasarak as Overlord of the Shadakine Empire, a great storm broke upon the Sea of Dreams, a storm that raged with unnatural intensity. Lashed by wind and rain, illuminated by wild lightning, the waters heaved and danced in fury to the thundering music of the storm, unchecked by even the enchantments of the Shianti. When finally the tempest died, the Shianti looked out in amazement on the shattered hull of a ship drifting towards their shore. Never before had this occurred, for the enchantments and mage winds had kept them secure from the curiosity of man by forcing him to sail close to his own land.</p>
     <p>The Shianti went quickly to the ruined ship where they found only one survivor&emdash;a baby. They perceived the sudden arrival of this human child as a sign of great portent, and they conceived a plan by which they might lawfully aid mankind. They named the orphan child Grey Star, because a star is the symbol of hope in the Shianti faith, and because of the silver streak in the child&apos;s jet-black hair. In the shadow of the wrath of the Goddess Ishir, they raised the child as one of their own and taught him their secrets. Diligently they set about their instruction, for their aim was to provide a saviour for mankind. Armed with the might of Shianti wizardry and wisdom, their hope was to create an adversary equal in power to the evil Wytch-king of Shadaki, for they realized that only with the death of Shasarak would man once more be free to determine his destiny.</p>

     <p>You are Grey Star, trained in the secret arts of a Shianti wizard. Sixteen years have passed since you arrived on the Isle of Lorn, the hidden realm of the Shianti race, when you are called to a meeting of your Shianti masters.</p>
     <p><quote>Grey Star,</quote> says Acarya, High Wizard of the Shianti, <quote>you have been summoned to this meeting so that we may lay before you a quest of great importance. Your people, the race of man, are slaves of an evil tyrant, Shasarak the Wytch-king of Shadaki. He has made pacts with demons and has captured the spirits of the dead who do his bidding as undead slaves. He has the power to control the minds of men; none can resist him and the land of your birth cries out in fear of the cruel hand that crushes its heart. No power remains intact to challenge the might of the Wytch-king. Our ancient vow to the Goddess Ishir forbids us from intervening in the fate of man, and the Moonstone now lies hidden on another plane. We have taught you the ways of Shianti magic in the hope that one day you would take up this quest&emdash;to recover the Moonstone and use its power to destroy the Wytch-king. You are human. No vow prohibits you from leaving the Isle of Lorn, nor are you forbidden to aid mankind in any way you choose. No charge is laid upon you to accept the quest, yet if you refuse, your people will be doomed to a choice between slavery and destruction at the hands of the Wytch-king of Shadaki.</quote></p>
     <p>Bravely and without hesitation, you give Acarya your decision, but your voice trembles as you speak: <quote>I accept the quest of the Moonstone. What must I do?</quote></p>
     <p>There are sighs of relief all round. <quote>You have made us proud this day, son of man,</quote> says Acarya, smiling. <quote>The Moonstone lies hidden in the Daziarn plane, which can only be entered by locating its portal. We know this can be found in the lands of men: it is called the <quote>Shadow Gate</quote>. However, it rarely remains in any one location for more than a day and is invisible to human sight. For this reason you must seek out the Lost Tribe of Lara, a race of primitive but magical creatures we call the Kundi. They possess the gift of astral vision, which enables them to see the Shadow Gate. Once, long ago, the Kundi inhabited the forests and mountains of Lara. Before the Shadakine army invaded the free provinces of the south, they passed through the mountains of Lara, using the Morn Pass. There the Shadakine army were frequently ambushed and delayed by the Kundi, who always disappeared into the safety of the forests before the Shadakine could retaliate. Finally, in desperation, the Wytch-king burnt the forests, and the Kundi were forced to flee. To this day, no one is sure where the Kundi went, and consequently men refer to them as the Lost Tribe of Lara. Your first task is to find the lost tribe and persuade them to guide you to the Shadow Gate. Your training is incomplete but you must begin without delay. The Shadakine Empire now stretches to the very shores of the Sea of Dreams, and the power of the Wytch-king grows with each passing day. Our presence is known to him and his attention is often turned towards us, probing our defences and testing the measure of our powers. He is hungry for new conquest, and though he fears us, the day is sure to come when he will cross the Sea of Dreams to challenge the Shianti.</quote></p>
     <p>Acarya places his hands upon your shoulders and looks deeply into your eyes. <quote>The fate of humanity and of the Shianti depends on the success of your quest. Find the Moonstone, Grey Star.&ellips; You are our only hope; if you fail then all is lost.</quote></p>

     <p>Before you set off on your adventure, you must discover how well your Shianti masters have prepared you for your quest by determining your fighting prowess&emdash;<typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ>&emdash;your state of mind&emdash;<typ class="attribute">WILLPOWER</typ>&emdash;and your physical stamina&emdash;<typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ>. To do this take a pencil and, with eyes closed, point with the blunt end of it on to the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a>. If you pick 0 it counts as zero.</p>
     <p>The first number that you pick from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> in this way represents your <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ>.

(e.g., if your pencil fell on the number 4 in the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> you would write in a <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> of 14.) When you fight, your <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> will be pitted against that of your enemy. A high score in this section is therefore very desirable.</p>
     <p>The second number that you pick from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> represents your <typ class="attribute">WILLPOWER</typ>. Add 20 to this number and write the total in the <typ class="attribute">WILLPOWER</typ> section of your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a> (e.g., if your pencil fell on the number 6 in the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> you would have a <typ class="attribute">WILLPOWER</typ> of 26). If you decide to use a spell or utilize the power of your Wizard&apos;s Staff, then you will lose <typ class="attribute">WILLPOWER</typ> points. If at any time your <typ class="attribute">WILLPOWER</typ> falls to zero, you may not use any of your spells or your Wizard&apos;s Staff.<a id="gamerulz-1" idref="gamerulz-1-foot" class="footnote"/> Lost <typ class="attribute">WILLPOWER</typ> points can be regained during the course of the adventure, and it is possible for your <typ class="attribute">WILLPOWER</typ> points to rise above the total with which you start your adventure.</p>
     <p>The third number that you pick from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> represents your powers of <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ>. Add 20 to this number and write the total in the <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> section of your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a> (e.g., if your pencil fell on the number 6 on the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> you would have 26 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points).

Lost <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points can be regained during the course of the adventure but can never rise above the number with which you start your adventure.</p>

         <p><a idref="enchant-ill" class="accent-illustration" />The <!--ERRTAG-RA-25228-->Power<!--/ERRTAG-RA-25228--> of Enchantment enables a wizard to charm or beguile other creatures, and create illusions in the minds of others. He will be able to extract information from others, place thoughts and compulsions into another&apos;s mind or cause them to believe that imaginary events are actually taking place. Some magical or highly intelligent beings may be immune to the powers of Enchantment.</p>

         <p><a idref="elementl-ill" class="accent-illustration" />The Power of elemental magic allows a wizard some control over the natural elements of Air, Fire, Earth and Water. By entering a trance and chanting incantations, you may summon aid from the spirits of the Elemental Plane. Elementals have very little understanding of man, and for this reason a wizard can never be sure of the nature of the aid the Elementals may send.</p>

A wizard wishing to speak with the dead, or to call up a form from the spirit world, must draw a magic pentacle and enter a trance, when the use of the correct spell-chant will reach out to the Spiritual Plane. Standing within the protection of a magic pentacle, a wizard may consider himself to be relatively safe from harm. If he wishes to speak with a corpse, especially one whose former life was good and righteous, then a wizard can expect help and advice. However, contact with those whose former lives were evil or selfish can be a perilous, and often fatal, experience. Evil spirits are reluctant to return to the realm of the dead and may try to trick a wizard into freeing them into the world of the living. All spirits, good and evil, will require some service of the wizard in return for their aid. Any failure to perform this task, however difficult may result in the wizard losing his life.</p>

         <p><a idref="staff-ill" class="accent-illustration" />Your Staff is your most valuable possession. It looks and feels like an ordinary quarterstaff, yet it is stronger than any known metal. This is your main combat weapon, for you are untrained in the use of any other form of armed combat. It contains a potent force that is unleashed at will by the power of your mind, and causes a beam of destructive power to hurtle from its tip. Every time you unleash this power you must deduct 1 <typ class="attribute">WILLPOWER</typ> point.</p>
         <p>In the event that your enemy survives such an attack or should you fall victim to a surprise attack, you will be forced to engage in close combat and must attempt to strike your enemy with the Staff. If your attack is successful, a bolt of energy will be released from the Staff that is capable of inflicting great physical harm. If you wish to increase the amount of damage that you inflict in this way, you must use more <typ class="attribute">WILLPOWER</typ> points and multiply the number of <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points lost by the enemy, accordingly. For example, if you chose to expend 3 <typ class="attribute">WILLPOWER</typ> points on your attack, all enemy <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> point losses would be multiplied by three.</p>
         <p>If you enter combat without your Staff, deduct 6 points from your <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> If you have no weapon at all, you must deduct 8 points from your <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ>.</p>

       <p>There will be occasions during your adventure when you have to fight an enemy. The enemy&apos;s <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> and <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points are given in the text. Grey Star&apos;s aim during the combat is to kill the enemy by reducing his <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points to zero while at the same time losing as few <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points as possible himself.</p>
       <p>At the start of a combat, enter Grey Star&apos;s <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> and <typ class="attribute">WILLPOWER</typ> points and the enemy&apos;s <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points in the appropriate boxes on the Combat Record section of your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
       <p>The sequence for combat is as follows:</p>
       <ol class="paragraphed">
        <li>
         <p>Calculate your current <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> total, based on the weapon you are using. (Remember, if you enter combat without your Staff, you must deduct 6 points from your <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ>. If you have no weapon at all, you must deduct 8 points.)</p></li>
        <li>
         <p>Subtract the <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> of your enemy from this total. The result is your Combat Ratio. Enter it on the <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>.</p></li>
        <li>
         <p><a id="stage3">If you are using your Wizard&apos;s Staff</a>, decide how many <typ class="attribute">WILLPOWER</typ> points you wish to use. (Remember, you must expend at least 1 point.) Enter this number on your Combat Record in the box marked <typ class="attribute">WILLPOWER</typ>.</p>
         <p>Example</p>
          <p>Grey Star (<typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> 15, <typ class="attribute">WILLPOWER</typ> 23) is ambushed by a Deathgaunt (<typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> 20). He is not given the opportunity to evade combat, but he can use his Wizard&apos;s Staff against the creature as it swoops down on him. He subtracts the Deathgaunt&apos;s <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> from his own, giving a Combat Ratio of &minus;5. (15 &minus; 20 = &minus;5). &minus;5 is noted on the <a idref="action">Action Chart</a> as the Combat Ratio. Grey Star decides to use 2 <typ class="attribute">WILLPOWER</typ> points, which is noted on the <typ class="attribute">WILLPOWER</typ> box of the Combat Record.</p></li>

        <li><p>When you have decided upon the number of <typ class="attribute">WILLPOWER</typ> points you wish to use, and have determined your Combat Ratio, pick a number from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a>.</p></li>
        <li>
         <p>Turn to the <a idref="crtable">Combat Results Table</a> on the inside back cover of the book. Along the top of the chart are shown the Combat Ratio numbers. Find the number that is the same as your Combat Ratio and cross-reference it with the random number that you have picked. (The random numbers appear on the side of the chart.) You now have the number of <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points lost by Grey Star. To calculate the number lost by the enemy, multiply this by the number of <typ class="attribute">WILLPOWER</typ> points that Grey Star elected to use. Now you have the final number of <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points lost by both Grey Star and his enemy in this round of combat. (E represents points lost by the enemy; GS represents points lost by Grey Star.)</p>
         <p>Example</p>
         <p>The Combat Ratio between Grey Star and the Deathgaunt has been established as &minus;5, and Grey Star&apos;s <typ class="attribute">WILLPOWER</typ> points used as 2. If the number taken from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> is a 6, then the result of the first round of combat is:</p>
         <ul>
          <li>Grey Star loses 4 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points.</li>
          <li>Deathgaunt loses 5 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points, multiplied by 2 <typ class="attribute">WILLPOWER</typ> points, giving a total of 10 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points lost in all.</li>
         </ul>
        </li>
        <li><p>On the <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>, mark the changes in <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points to the participants in the combat, and Grey Star&apos;s amended <typ class="attribute">WILLPOWER</typ> points total.</p></li>
        <li><p>Unless otherwise instructed, or unless you have an option to evade, the next round of combat now starts.</p></li>
        <li><p>Repeat the sequence from <a idref="stage3">Stage 3</a>.</p></li>
       </ol>

       <p>This process of combat continues until the <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points of either the enemy or Grey Star are reduced to zero, at which point the one with the zero score is declared dead. If Grey Star is dead, the adventure is over. If the enemy is dead, Grey Star proceeds but with his <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> and <typ class="attribute">WILLPOWER</typ> points reduced.</p>

     <p>You are about to embark on a quest of great peril, for your journey will take you to an unknown land that is dominated by evil. Refer to the <a idref="map">map</a> and make notes as you progress through the story: they are sure to be of great help to you in future adventures.</p>
     <p>You will discover items that could be of help to you on your quest. Some Special Items may aid you in future Grey Star adventures, others may be red herrings of no real use at all, so be selective in what you decide to keep.</p>
     <p>Be cautious in your use of <typ class="attribute">WILLPOWER</typ> points, as your <typ class="attribute">WILLPOWER</typ> is the energy source for your Magical Powers and your Wizard&apos;s Staff. A score of zero <typ class="attribute">WILLPOWER</typ> points will leave you weak and vulnerable to attack, unable to offer effective resistance.</p>
     <p>Follow the path of wisdom, Wizard Grey Star. The way of fools is the road to destruction.</p>
     <p>Good luck!</p>

       <p>It is a grim, chill morning, your last on the Isle of Lorn. With quaking heart, you enter the sacred temple of Amida to receive the silent blessing of your Shianti masters. They stand around you, heads bowed in meditation. At length, the ceremony ends and Maiteya, your old friend and teacher, steps forward, and grasps you firmly by the shoulders. You look into his glittering eyes and see yourself reflected there, for the eyes of the Shianti race are not coloured like man&apos;s but have pupils that cast reflections like mirrored glass.</p>

       <p><quote>Grey Star,</quote> he says, a warm smile lighting his serene face, <quote>the time has come for you to leave. Far will you travel and perilous is your course. Be not afraid, yet do not fear caution. Though you go with the teaching and blessing of the Shianti and carry the might of the Wizard&apos;s Staff, stealth and secrecy will be your allies. Let not courage defeat wisdom. Go now and seek the Kundi race that are called the Lost Tribe of Lara. You are the instrument of our will, bearer of our hope. Ever will your quest be in our minds and hearts.</quote></p>
       <p>Without a word, you turn and leave the temple, not looking back until you reach the shore, where a sail boat awaits you. With a gentle sigh, you bid farewell to the island of your youth and push the little craft into the cold waters of the Sea of Dreams. You jump into the boat and set sail, making a westward course for the distant mainland of the Shadakine Empire.</p>

       <p>The way leads south through the farms and paddy fields of the region. The path keeps firmly to the line of the Azan River as it curves towards the great Azagad Gorge, a great pitted canyon of weathered limestone columns. In order to maintain the secrecy of your presence, you avoid the homesteads that nestle by the river.</p>
       <p>You walk for two long days and must consume 2 Meals or lose 6 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points. The regulated squares of the rice fields become fewer and fewer, and finally give way to a flat expanse of unyielding plains called the Wilderwastes, which are devoid of human habitation.

Your chest contracts with pain every time you draw breath and the humid, fetid air clings to the sides of your throat. Slowly and painfully, you climb the tall tree while the columns of insects march relentlessly towards you, their pincers gnashing and clacking in crazed fury.</p>
       <p>Grimly you ignore the savage pain of your wounded leg. Looking up you gasp with dismay, for a line of Cave Mantiz has somehow gained the branch above your head.

       <p>As the river begins to narrow, the once clear waters of the Azan River become a murky brown. Close to the banks, there are many shallow inlets where stagnant pools and swamps are overgrown with clumps of rope-like tendrils. These tendrils form the branches of a large plant called the Yaku. The tendrils are sensitized vines that snake across the ground towards a pool or into the main river, for the rest of the limestone canyon is arid. At the heart of the Yaku plant is a cluster of sharp points, and Shan warns you to keep well clear of these poisoned barbs.</p>

       <p><quote>Ah now,</quote> begins the drunken merchant with some relish, <quote>the legend, eh? Well, there are many stories, and in my travels I have heard most of them. No word of the Laranese have I ever heard in the far north, the free kingdoms of the Lastlands, nor here in the Shadakine Empire. No indeed, the only story I ever heard that seemed authentic came to me in the city of Elzian where I was trading with the Magicians of Dessi. There I heard a story of the exile of the Lost Tribe to the cloud forests of the far south, that perilous place named the Azanam. Others, though, speak of the forested Shuri Mountains.</quote></p>
       <p>In a very loud voice, the merchant begins relating one of the many stories he has heard about the Laranese. You notice that many people are fuming to stare, muttering and whispering. Before you can attempt to quieten him, a hand grabs your shoulder. You and the merchant have been arrested by four burly Shadakine guards.</p>

       <p>The hours of your ordeal pass slowly. Mother Magri chants and intones every charm and spell in every language that she knows, but she cannot penetrate the curtain that enfolds your memory, shrouding that part of your mind that bears your quest. It must be Shianti enchantment bestowed, without your knowing, by the masters of the Isle of Lorn. However, Mother Magri does not relent, and you lose 4 <typ class="attribute">WILLPOWER</typ> points and 2 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points.

       <p><quote>Let me down. Let me down!</quote> an old woman croaks angrily. The approaching warriors and those who carry you on their shoulders stare at you in disbelief. You have transformed yourself into an old woman carrying a walking stick, or at least that is what the others see.</p>
       <p><quote>Torment a poor old woman would you?</quote> you screech, thumping those nearby on the back, slapping a few heads and tweaking an ear or two before prodding a Shadakine warrior with your Staff. <quote>And as for you,</quote> you cry indignantly, <quote>have you no shame? Order this rabble to let me down and show some respect for a woman of my years.</quote> With this, you begin another shower of slaps and thumps to the great amusement of the Shadakine.</p>
       <p>Slowly, you are lowered to the ground. Grumbling, you hobble away while puzzled and suspicious eyes look on. However, the Shadakine Warriors are completely fooled, slapping their thighs and roaring with laughter as the stunned crowd disperses in angry silence. A sense of unrest emanates from those who remain behind, and you know that you must leave the harbour area quickly, before your illusion is challenged. An illusion is easily dispelled by one who disbelieves in the image or picture that Enchantment places in the mind, and a visual illusion is hard to maintain for long periods, as details tend to fade and waver after a time, losing their consistency and revealing flaws to the cynical observer.</p>

        <p>There are numerous unanswered questions with this combat. The addition of <typ class="attribute">WILLPOWER</typ> and <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> is straightforward, but which attribute do you lower when wounded in this mental combat? A mental combat would suggest that you will lose <typ class="attribute">WILLPOWER</typ> as this is the measure of you mental strength. It is possible to have a negative <typ class="attribute">WILLPOWER</typ> score which would mean that the combat would only come to an end when the Darkling Room&apos;s <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> was lowered to 0. Using you true <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> score is the less paradoxical route.</p>
        <p>In either case, if your <typ class="attribute">WILLPOWER</typ> or <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> score is lowered during a round of combat, do you then adjust your combined <typ class="attribute">WILLPOWER</typ> and <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> score which is serving as your <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> for this combat.</p>
        <p>There are no easy answers to these questions. It is up to the reader to decide which solution is most appropriate.</p>
        <p>Also, you cannot use your Wizard&apos;s Staff in this combat; since the combat is mental in nature, it would be inappropriate to us it, which means that you should not be able to use <typ class="attribute">WILLPOWER</typ> to multiply your opponents loss of <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ>.</p>

       <p>Inexplicably, the brooding fear that lurks within you is rising uncontrollably. Shan is shaking, his face panic-stricken. Gingerly, you step through the soft mud of the quagmire. The air smells pungently sweet&emdash;a cloying odour that is hard to identify. You cannot escape the feeling that there is someone or something else in the cavern, but it is difficult to see in the eerie darkness. The sucking ooze pulls at your feet, and in the distance you see a faint light from another passage on the far side of the cavern.</p>
       <p><quote>Grey Star!</quote> shrieks Shan, looking down, his eyes wide with terror. For the muddy cavern floor is comprised of hundreds upon hundreds of corpses, piled high upon each other to form a ghastly mire. Shan is screaming hysterically, but before you can calm him the aura and spirit of this awful place overwhelms your mind, filling it with nightmarish visions.</p>
       <p>You are in the Darkling Room of Mother Magri, and you must combat its fear if you are ever to leave.

       <p>Your sleep proves both rewarding and refreshing. You have a strange dream in which Acarya, High Wizard of the Shianti, appears before you. He raises his hands in blessing and chants gently in the tongue of his people. Briefly, you catch a glimpse of the Temple of Amida and a circle of Shianti wizards standing with their hands raised to the sky.</p>
       <p>They have sent the power of their thoughts to aid you. Their blessing strengthens your <typ class="attribute">WILLPOWER</typ>, increasing it by 10 points.</p>

Your Backpack and Staff are taken from you, and your hands are tied.<a id="sect311-1" idref="sect311-1-foot" class="footnote"/> For more than an hour you are marched through the streets of Suhn, coming at last to a large, black stone citadel built on a broad hill overlooking Suhn. This is the Hall of Correction, an instrument of Shadakine law more concerned with punishment than order.</p>
       <p>A burly Shadakine guard grabs you by the shoulders, pressing on your wound where the crossbow bolt&apos;s shaft still protrudes; pain shoots through your body. He drags you through the heavy iron doors and throws you to the floor of a sparse, stony entrance hall. The wound has opened again, and warm blood runs down your arm. <quote>I&apos;m bleeding,</quote> you say to the brutish Shadakine guard. <quote>I need a Healer. This quarrel must be removed and the wound dressed.</quote></p>
       <p>The Shadakine guard looks at you contemptuously. <quote>Wound?&ellips; Dressed?&ellips;</quote> He snorts with disgust. <quote>That&apos;s just a scratch. I&apos;ve had far worse fighting in the Old Wars of the Empire. No <quote>Healers</quote> on the field then. Where&apos;s your grit, boy?</quote> He steps towards you and grabs at the bolt shaft.</p>
       <p><quote>NO!</quote> you shout, horrified. But before you can stop him, he has torn the bolt from your shoulder, complete with barbed head. You feel that you must faint with pain.</p>
       <p><quote>Healers&ellips; dress the wound&ellips; hmph!</quote> the Shadakine mutters to himself. He produces a flask and pulls out the stopper. <quote>This&apos;ll stop the greenrot,</quote> he says, pouring a clear liquid over the wound in liberal quantities, washing away the blood. The liquid burns like acid, but it quickly staunches the bleeding. The Shadakine laughs and thumps you on the back, making you flinch.</p>
       <p>The crude battlefield remedy has cost you 1 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> point, but the treatment is effective, and the injury heals without complications, although you will have a livid scar on your shoulder for the rest of your life.</p>

It flaps its wings desperately, climbing at an acute angle and only just gaining enough height to clear the wall. Shan gives a shout of delight. <quote>Quick thinking,</quote> he says, laughing through his fear. <quote>Maybe these bird-brained frogs are a bit stupid, eh?</quote></p>
       <p>You smile and give him a reassuring nod. Privately, you are not so sure that they are.</p>

Some forty apelike men with long tails swing bundles of smoking leaves at the end of lengths of vine. The smoke gives off a choking stench that throws the huge insects into confusion.

       <p>Through watering eyes, you watch the strange, stunted men using their tails to swing from tree limb to branch with astonishing agility, flushing out the insect invaders with practised ease. These are the Kundi. You have found the Lost Tribe of Lara.</p>
       <p>As you watch the one-sided battle draw to a close, two sets of hairy arms grab you and lift you bodily into the air. Your ape-like abductors carry you through the giddy heights, leaping and swinging from tree to tree, tossing you like a bale of hay. You are being carried through a fine mist of cloud, from which the Azawood tree draws much of its moisture. Up here, in the highest levels of the forest, is a complex of wooden houses and platforms. You are dumped unceremoniously outside the largest of these tree houses: the house of the Kundi king.</p>
       <p>The old king regards you with undisguised displeasure. <quote>I am Okosa, Kundi king&emdash;why you come and who are you?</quote></p>
       <p>Quietly you tell the king of your quest for the Moonstone of the Shianti, your search for the Shadow Gate and your need of the magical Kundi vision to guide you there.</p>
       <p><quote>You no Shianti&ellips; You bring creeping death from below&ellips; Kundi guide you nowhere,</quote> he says, eyeing you suspiciously. No matter how you try, you cannot convince him that you are a Shianti wizard and that you were trying to escape from the terrible Mantiz attack, not leading it. He turns his back on you with a derisive snort.</p>
       <p><quote>I can make great magic,</quote> you say hopefully, <quote>ancient magic, <cite><!--ERRTAG-RE-377024-->The Way of the Shianti<!--/ERRTAG-RE-377024--></cite>.</quote></p>
       <p><quote>Wytch-king make magic, Shadakine make magic. This prove nothing,</quote> the king replies with a dismissive wave of the hand.</p>
       <p><quote>How then, can I prove the truth of my words to you?</quote> you ask, helplessly.</p>
       <p>The Kundi King gives you a sly look over his shoulder, eyebrows raised. <quote>Prove?</quote> he says. <quote>Yes, you prove many things, I think, when Urik, wise elder of the Kundi Tribe, has words with you. Then you see some <em>Kundi</em> magic! Not Shadakine spells and whispers.</quote></p>
       <p>Patiently, you wait. Faintly, you can hear the jingling of tiny bells and a hoarse voice chanting a monotonous rhythm, tunelessly. At length, a wizened old Kundi is led into the room. He is covered in bird feathers and numerous small bells, and his mad, bulging eyes roll around their sockets. The Kundi king and the old Kundi&apos;s escorts look to him with reverence, for he is their Shaman and a respected figure in their society. To your eyes, however, he looks faintly ridiculous, shambling around you in a comic, bowlegged dance, waving and rattling a strange, fur-covered talisman in your face and repeating his dissonant litany in an endless monotone. Your own instinctive powers tell you that no magic is being performed here, and you look with interest, curious to see what happens next. Suddenly the mad old Kundi falls silent. He is short of breath, his bony chest wheezing. He bares the blackened stumps of his rotten teeth, and pressing his face close to yours, so close that you can smell the stink of his fetid breath, he speaks to you.</p>

       <p>The fate of your quest hangs upon the words of a child&apos;s nursery rhyme, it seems. Okosa, the Kundi king, agrees to grant you a guide to the Shadow Gate, only if you can answer the old Shaman&apos;s rhyme. Anxiously, you listen to his words, burning them into your mind.</p>

    <data>
     <p>(<a idref="gamerulz">The Game Rules</a>) It is possible for your <typ class="attribute">WILLPOWER</typ> to fall below zero. For example, if you are the victim of an attack that drains your <typ class="attribute">WILLPOWER</typ>, your score may be forced below zero. If your <typ class="attribute">WILLPOWER</typ> falls to zero or below, you will not be able to cast spells or use your Wizard&apos;s Staff until your score is again above zero.</p>
     <p>(<a idref="equipmnt">Equipment</a>) This Special Item can be used in combat as if it were a normal Weapon. The Jewelled Dagger&apos;s bonus to your <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> should only be applied when the Jewelled Dagger is used in combat. You should not use your Wizard&apos;s Staff at the same time. This would incur the normal &minus;6 penalty to your <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> for not using your Wizard&apos;s Staff.</p>
     <p>Alternatively, you may decide that the Jewelled Dagger may be wielded together with your Wizard&apos;s Staff, and thus confers its bonus in all close combats. This makes the Jewelled Dagger a much more useful item.</p>
     <p>(<a idref="equipmnt">Equipment</a>) The bonus to your <typ class="attribute">WILLPOWER</typ> score provided by the Magic Talisman is added to your <typ class="attribute">WILLPOWER</typ> score only once and does not prevent your score from falling to zero.</p>
     <p>(<a idref="equipmnt">Equipment</a>) If you have mastered the Lesser Magick of Alchemy and therefore have a Herb Pouch, you may choose to keep potions, vials, or ingredients in either the Herb Pouch or your Backpack. All other Backpack Items must be kept in your Backpack.</p>
     <p>(<a idref="sect15">Section 15</a>) The exact nature of this restoration of <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> and <typ class="attribute">WILLPOWER</typ> is unclear. There is a general consensus that you should multiply your current <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> and <typ class="attribute">WILLPOWER</typ> scores by 1.5. I.e. you may add one half of your current <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points value to your score, remembering that you may not exceed your starting value; and you may add one half of your current <typ class="attribute">WILLPOWER</typ> value to your score, irrespective of whether this exceeds your starting value.</p>
     <p>(<a idref="sect43">Section 43</a>) You cannot keep Shan&apos;s Backpack. Any items you decide to keep must be transferred to your own Backpack, or perhaps to your Herb Pouch if you have one and want to keep the Small Vial of Laumspur.</p>
     <p>(<a idref="sect101">Section 101</a>) It seems odd that Shan would not return your weapon. You may choose to assume that you get it back once the battle is over.</p>
     <p>(<a idref="sect110">Section 110</a>) This is the correct solution to the riddle in <a idref="sect264">Section 264</a>.</p>
     <p>(<a idref="sect183">Section 183</a>) Tarama Seeds may be recorded as Special Items since they don&apos;t take up space in your Herb Pouch or Backpack. Each Tarama Seed can be used to cast exactly one spell or to use your Wizard&apos;s Staff outside of close combat (e.g. to fire a bolt of energy at a distant enemy) without using the normally required <typ class="attribute">WILLPOWER</typ> points. Tarama Seeds cannot be used to maintain the effect of a spell or in place of other drains on your <typ class="attribute">WILLPOWER</typ>, like mental attacks. It also seems inappropriate to use a Tarama Seed in close combat where you could then decide to expend an infinite amount of <typ class="attribute">WILLPOWER</typ> to automatically win a fight.</p>
     <p>(<a idref="sect193">Section 193</a>) The Yabari Ointment can be applied at any time and is effective until it is washed off or until this adventure is over. If you choose to apply the ointment, delete this item from your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a> but make a note that you instead are now wearing the ointment.</p>
     <p>(<a idref="sect193">Section 193</a>) Tarama Seeds may be recorded as Special Items since they don&apos;t take up space in your Herb Pouch or Backpack. Each Tarama Seed can be used to cast exactly one spell or to use your Wizard&apos;s Staff outside of close combat (e.g. to fire a bolt of energy at a distant enemy) without using the normally required <typ class="attribute">WILLPOWER</typ> points. Tarama Seeds cannot be used to maintain the effect of a spell or in place of other drains on your <typ class="attribute">WILLPOWER</typ>, like mental attacks. It also seems inappropriate to use a Tarama Seed in close combat where you could then decide to expend an infinite amount of <typ class="attribute">WILLPOWER</typ> to automatically win a fight.</p>
     <p>(<a idref="sect211">Section 211</a>) You must have the Power of Evocation in order to attempt to raise the dead priest.</p>
     <p>(<a idref="sect215">Section 215</a>) If you have arrived here from <a idref="sect156">Section 156</a>, there is no description of how the Shadakine officer is killed. This appears to be an oversight by the author.</p>
     <p>(<a idref="sect215">Section 215</a>) Tarama Seeds may be recorded as Special Items since they don&apos;t take up space in your Herb Pouch or Backpack. Each Tarama Seed can be used to cast exactly one spell or to use your Wizard&apos;s Staff outside of close combat (e.g. to fire a bolt of energy at a distant enemy) without using the normally required <typ class="attribute">WILLPOWER</typ> points. Tarama Seeds cannot be used to maintain the effect of a spell or in place of other drains on your <typ class="attribute">WILLPOWER</typ>, like mental attacks. It also seems inappropriate to use a Tarama Seed in close combat where you could then decide to expend an infinite amount of <typ class="attribute">WILLPOWER</typ> to automatically win a fight.</p>
     <p>(<a idref="sect245">Section 245</a>) Make sure to restore your Wizard&apos;s Staff, Backpack and Backpack Items to your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
     <p>(<a idref="sect259">Section 259</a>) There are numerous unanswered questions with this combat. The addition of <typ class="attribute">WILLPOWER</typ> and <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> is straightforward, but which attribute do you lower when wounded in this mental combat? A mental combat would suggest that you will lose <typ class="attribute">WILLPOWER</typ> as this is the measure of you mental strength. It is possible to have a negative <typ class="attribute">WILLPOWER</typ> score which would mean that the combat would only come to an end when the Darkling Room&apos;s <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> was lowered to 0. Using you true <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> score is the less paradoxical route.</p>
     <p>In either case, if your <typ class="attribute">WILLPOWER</typ> or <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> score is lowered during a round of combat, do you then adjust your combined <typ class="attribute">WILLPOWER</typ> and <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> score which is serving as your <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> for this combat.</p>
     <p>There are no easy answers to these questions. It is up to the reader to decide which solution is most appropriate.</p>
     <p>Also, you cannot use your Wizard&apos;s Staff in this combat; since the combat is mental in nature, it would be inappropriate to us it, which means that you should not be able to use <typ class="attribute">WILLPOWER</typ> to multiply your opponents loss of <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ>.</p>
     <p>(<a idref="sect264">Section 264</a>) The section corresponding to the correct answer will have a footnote confirming that it is indeed correct.</p>
     <p>(<a idref="sect297">Section 297</a>) These empty Vials may be used later to contain potions. Some Vials are useless once contaminated.</p>
     <p>(<a idref="sect300">Section 300</a>) Keep note of your Backpack Items in case you should find your Backpack again later.</p>
     <p>(<a idref="sect311">Section 311</a>) Keep note of your Backpack Items in case you should find your Backpack again later.</p>
     <p>(<a idref="sect320">Section 320</a>) These losses are in addition to any you may have already sustained in your duel with the Kazim Stone.</p>
     <p>(<a idref="sect342">Section 342</a>) There is no choice that leads to this section of the book. This appears to be an oversight which is not easily correctable.</p>
