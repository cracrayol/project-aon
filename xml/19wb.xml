Wolf's Bane

THE STORY SO FAR...

You are Grand Master Lone Wolf, the sole survivor 
of a massacre that wiped out the First Order of the
Kai - the warrior elite of Sommerlund.

It is the year MS 5080, thirty years since your brave 
kinsmen perished at the hands of the Darklords of 
Helgedad. These champions of evil, who were sent 
forth by Naar - the King of the darkness - to 
destroy the fertile world of Magnamund, have them-
selves since been destroyed. You vowed to avenge 
the murder of the Kai and you kept your pledge, 
for it was you who brought about their downfall 
when alone you infiltrated their foul domain - the 
Darklands -  and caused the destruction of their 
leader and the base of his power that was the 
infernal city of Helgedad.

In the wake of their destruction, chaos befell the 
Darkland armies who had been poised to conquer 
all of Magnamund. This disorder escalated into a 
mutinous civil war, which allowed the freestate 
armies of Magnamund time in which to recover 
and launch a counter-offensive. Against
the odds, a swift and total victory was secured over
the feuding Darklands armies.

For ten unbroken years peace has reigned in Som-
merlund. Under your direction, the once-ruined 
monastery of the Kai has been rebuilt and restored 
to its former glory, and the task of teaching a New 
Order of Kai warriors the skills and proud traditions 
of your ancestors is also well established. The new 
generation of Kai recruits, all of whom were born 
during the era of war against the Darklords, possess 
strong latent Kai skills and all show exceptional 
promise. These skills will be nurtured and honed 
to perfection during their time at the monastery so 
that they may teach and inspire future generations, 
thereby ensuring the continued security of your 
homeland in future years.

Your attainment of the rank of Kai Grand Master 
brought with it great rewards. Some, such as the 
restoration of the Kai and the undying gratitude of
your fellow Somrnlending, could have been antici-
pated. Yet there have also been rewards which you
could not possibly have foreseen. The discovery 
that within you lay the potential to develop Kai 
Disciplines beyond those of the Magnakai (which
were thought to be the ultimate that a Kai Master 
could aspire to) was truly a revelation. Your dis- 
covery, has inspired you to search for the wisdom
and power that no Kai lord before you has ever 
possessed. In the name of your creator, the God 
Kai, and for the greater glory of Sommerlund and 
the Goddess Ishir, you have vowed to reach the 
very pinnacle of Kai perfection - to attain all of the 
Grand Master Disciplines and become the first Kai 
Supreme Master.

With diligence and determination you set about the 
restoration of the Kai monastery and the training 
of the New Order recruits. Your efforts were soon 
rewarded and, within the space of two short years, 
the first raw recruits had graduated to become a 
cadre of gifted Kai Masters who, in turn, were able 
to commence the teaching of their skills to sub-
sequent intakes of Kai novices. Readily the Kai Masters 
rose readily to their new-found responsibilities, 
leaving you free to devote more of your time to 
the pursuit and perfection of the Grand Master 
Disciplines. During this period you also received 
expert tutelage in the ways of magic from two of 
your most trusted friends and advisors: Guildmaster 
Banedon, leader of the Brotherhood of the Crystal 
Star, and Lord Rimoah, speaker for the High Coun-
cil of the Elder Magi.

In the deepest subterranean level of the monastery,
one hundred feet below the Tower of the Sun, you
ordered the excavation and construction of a special 
vault. In this magnificent chamber wrought of granite
and gold, you placed the seven Lorestones of 
Nyxator - gems of Kai power which you 
had recovered during your quest for Kai 
knowledge. In this vault, bathed in the golden light 
of those radiant gems, you spent countless hours in 
pursuit of perfection. Sometimes alone, sometimes 
in the company of your two able advisors - Bane-
don and Rimoah - you worked hard to develop 
your innate Grand Master disciplines, and grasp 
the fundamental secrets of Brotherhood and Old 
Kingdom Magic. During this time you noticed many 
remarkable changes taking place within your body; 
you became physically and mentally stronger, your 
five primary senses sharpened beyond all that 
you had experienced before, and, perhaps most 
remarkably, your body began to age at a much 
slower rate. Now for every five years that elapse 
you age but one year.

In the years since your victory over the Darklords,
peace has reigned victorious and the peoples of
the Free Kingdoms have rejoiced in the knowledge
that the evil which once threatened to destroy them 
has been banished from the face of Magnamund. 
Men have readily exchanged their swords for hoes 
and their shields for ploughs, and now the only 
marching they do is along the ruts of their freshly 
furrowed fields. Few are the watchful eyes that scan 
the distant horizon in fear of what may appear, 
although there are still some who maintain their 
vigilance, for the agents of the Dark God Naar 
come in many guises and there are those upon 
Magnamund who wait quietly in the shadows for 
the chance to do his evil bidding.

Already your new-found skills have been tested 
against Naar's agents and you have, on each 
occasion, acquitted yourself admirably. Yet your 
continuing victories have enraged the Dark God 
and inflamed his lust for vengeance. Three years 
earlier, you and your new Kai kinsmen achieved a 
glorious victory over a host of deadly Lavas. These 
dragon-like horrors were sent by Naar to destroy 
the Kai Monastery and lay waste to Sommerlund, 
and yet, despite their supernatural strength, they 
were defeated in battle by the sheer courage and 
skill of the New Order Kai who fought magnifi-
cently under your leadership.

After the ignominious defeat of his minions, Naar 
retreated to the Plane of Darkness to plot and 
scheme anew. Victory at the monastery had won 
for you a respite in the Dark God's war against 
Sommerlund and the Kai. The following three 
years were peaceful for your homeland, yet else-
where on Magnamund the agents of Naar con-
tinued their insidious work. On several occasions 
your special skills were sought by envoys from
foreign realms whose leaders were desperate to rid 
themselves of Naar's minions. Courageously you
undertook many of these dangerous missions and,
by succeeding where no other mortal could, you
brought fresh glories upon yourself and your fellow
Kai.

In the summer of MS 5080, during a return voyage 
by sea from a successful quest to distant Dessi, an
act of sabotage very nearly wrecked the sailing ship 
that was transporting you home. Only fair weather
and skilful repairs by the Sommlending crew saved 
the ship from being lost in the Gulf of Durenor.
When the damaged craft limped into its home port 
of Anskaven, more than two weeks late, the recep-
tion you received was far from welcoming. The 
normally cheerful seafaring folk of this busy port
were in a strangely sullen mood. Clearly they all 
recognized you, yet none cheered as you disem-
barked on Anskaven quay. The crowd were quietly 
hostile. Before you could determine their reasons, 
the uneasy silence was shattered by a troop of 
heavily-armoured cavalrymen who came galloping 
along the quayside, their gleaming swords drawn. 
The crowd scattered as the horsemen drew up in 
a circle around you. Their leader, a nervous young 
lieutenant whose coat bore the black eagle and 
three hearts motif of Avan Caldar, Baron of Ans-
kaven, curtly ordered you to lay down your 
weapons. Not wishing to provoke these city troop-
ers, you obeyed the command and allowed them 
to escort you to Baron Caldar's castle where you 
felt sure their inglorious mistake would be swiftly 
punished.

Baron Caldar formally received you in the Great
Hall of his castle. You had met previously on many 
state occasions at King Ulnar's court in Holmgard 
and had always held each other in high esteem. 
Yet Caldar, flanked by more than a dozen armed 
bodyguards, could barely bring himself to conceal 
his contempt. He spoke to you as if you were a 
hated criminal. You asked why you were being 
treated in such a manner, but your pleas fell on 
deaf ears. Without further explanation, he ordered 
that you be taken immediately to the dungeons 
and placed in irons.

Later that evening, using your mental Kai Disci­
plines to help loosen the tight-lipped resolve of a 
dungeon guard, you learned the reasons for your 
apparent fall from grace.

'You first arrived in Anskaven by ship eighteen days 
ago, as expected,' said the gaoler, in response to 
your psychic commands. 'Baron Caldar met you 
personally at the quayside and gave you a horse 
and six of his best troopers to escort you to Toran. 
During your ride to that city, they say you mur-
dered his men and burnt their bodies. On arriving 
at Toran, you tried to assassinate Banedon - the 
Guildmaster of the Brotherhood of the Crystal Star. 
He survived, yet much of the Guildmaster's Hall 
was destroyed by your doing. To cover your 
escape from the city, you poisoned the wells caus-
ing hundreds of deaths. At first it was said that a 
Helghast had adopted your likeness to gain entry 
to the Guildhall, but Guildmaster Banedon refuted 
these claims. He is convinced that you are pos-
sessed by the spirit of Naar. The Guildmaster dis-
patched the Toran militia to spread this message 
across Somrnerlund. A few days later at the forest
village of Dumf allow, near Tyso, the Fryearl of 
Durnfallow was murdered and his manor house 
was torched to the ground. The villagers say they 
saw you riding away from the blazing ruins, howl­
ing like a crazed wolf. The people are terrified by 
the thought that Naar has corrupted you - their 
greatest hero - and turned you against your own. 
They are scared and they are demanding swift jus-
tice. King Ulnar has bowed to their will; he has 
sent all of his Border Rangers to Tyso with orders 
to find and kill you on sight.'

The news of your alleged crimes comes as a bitter 
blow. You are sure that it is all the handiwork of 
an agent of Naar, and you resolve to find and 
vanquish this impostor at the first opportunity. 
However, as you cast your eyes around the damp 
walls of the castle dungeon, you can only pray to 
Ishir and Kai that the Baron and his guards will 
believe your story and allow you a chance to 
reclaim your honour.
Wolf's Bane

THE GAME RULES

You keep a record of your adventure on the Action
Chart that you will find in the front of this book. 
For ease of use, and for further adventuring, it is 
recommended that you photocopy these pages.

For more than ten years, ever since the demise 
of the Darklords of Helgedad, you have devoted 
yourself to developing further your fighting prow-
ess - COMBAT SKILL -  and physical stamina -  ENDUR-
ANCE. Before you begin this Grand Master adven-
ture you need to measure how effective your 
training has been. To do this take a pencil and, 
with your eyes closed, point with the blunt end of it on 
to the Random Number Table on the last page of 
the book. If you pick a 0 it counts as zero.

The first number that you pick from the Random 
Number Table in this way represents your COMBAT 
SKILL. Add 25 to the number you picked and write 
the total in the COMBAT SKILL section of your Action 
Chart (ie if your pencil fell on the number 6 in 
the Random Number Table you would write in a 
COMBAT SKILL of 31). When you fight, your COMBAT 
SKILL will be pitted against that of your enemy. A 
high score in this section is therefore very desirable.

The second number that you pick from the 
Random Number Table represents your powers of 
ENDURANCE. Add 30 to this number and write the 
total in the ENDURANCE section of your Action Chart 
(ie if your pencil fell on the number 7 on the 
Random Number Table you would have 37 ENDUR-
ANCE points).

If you are wounded in combat you will lose ENDUR-
ANCE  points. If at any time your ENDURANCE points 
fall to zero, you are dead and the adventure is over. 
Lost ENDURANCE points can be regained during the 
course of the adventure, but your number of 
ENDURANCE points can not rise above the number
you have when you start an adventure.

Playing Tip: You may use a 10-sided die instead
of the Random Number Table if you find it easier.

If you have successfully completed any of the 
previous adventures In the Lone Wolf series
(Books 1-18), you can carry your current 
scores of SKILL and ENDURANCE points 
over to Book 19. These scores may include 
Weaponmastery, Curing and Psi-surge 
bonuses obtained upon completion of Lone 
Wolf Kai (Books 1-5) or Magnakai (Books 
6-12) adventures. Only if you have completed 
these previous adventures will you benefit 
from the appropriate bonuses in the course 
of the Grand Master series. You may also 
carry over any Weapons and Backpack Items 
you had in your possession at the end of your 
last adventure, and these should be entered 
on your new Grand Master Action Chart (you 
are still limited to two Weapons, but you may 
now carry up to ten Backpack Items). How-
ever, only the following Special Items may be 
carried over from the Lone Wolf Kai (Books
1-5) and Magnakai (Books 6-12) series, to 
the Lone Wolf Grand Master series (13
onwards):

Crystal Star pendant	Jewelled Mace
Sommerswerd	        Silver Bow of Duadon
Silver Helm	        Silver bracers
Kagonite Chainmail      Korlinium scabbard

Wolf's Bane

GRAND MASTER DISCIPLINES

Now, through the pursuit of new skills and the 
further development of your inate Kai abilities, 
you have set out upon a path of discovery that no 
other Kai Grand Master has ever attempted with 
success. Your determination to become the first Kai 
Supreme Master, by acquiring total proficiency in 
all twelve of the Grand Master disciplines, is an 
awe-inspiring challenge. You will be venturing into 
the unknown, pushing back the boundaries of 
human limitation in the pursuit of greatness and 
the cause of Good. May the blessings of the gods 
Kai and lshir go with you on your brave and noble 
quest.

In the years following the demise of the Darklords 
you have reached the rank of Kai Grand Defender, 
which means that you have mastered four of the 
Grand Master Disciplines listed below. It is up to 
you to choose which four disciplines these are. As 
all of the Grand Master Disciplines will be of use 
to you at some point during your adventure, pick 
your four skills with care. The correct use of a 
Grand Master Discipline at the right time could 
save your life. When you have chosen your four 
Disciplines, enter them in the Grand Master Disci-
plines section of your Action Chart.


Grand Weaponmastery
This discipline enables a Grand Master to become
supremely efficient in the use of all weapons. When
you enter combat with one of your Grand Master
weapons, you add 5 points to your COMBAT SKILL. 
The rank of Kai Grand Defender, with which you 
begin the Grand Master series, means you are skil-
led in two of the weapons listed opposite and over-
leaf.

Spear
Dagger
Mace
Short Sword
Warhammer
Bow
Quarterstaff
Broadsword
Axe
Sword

Animal Mastery
Grand Masters have considerable control over hos-
tile, non-sentient creatures. Also, they have the 
ability to converse with birds and fishes, and use 
them as guides.

Deliverance (Aduanced Curing)
Grand Masters are able to use their healing power 
to repair serious battle wounds. If, whilst in combat, 
their ENDURANCE is reduced to 8 points or less, 
they can draw upon their mastery to restore 20 
ENDURANCE points. This ability can only be used 
once every 20 days.

Assimilance (Aduanced Invisibility) 
Grand Masters are able to effect striking changes 
to their physical appearance, and maintain these 
changes over a period of a few days. They have
also mastered advanced camouflage techniques 
that make them virtually undetectable in an open 
landscape.

Grand Huntmastery
Grand Masters are able to see in total darkness, 
and have greatly heightened senses of touch and 
taste.

Grand Pathsmanship 
Grand Masters are able to resist entrapment by 
hostile plants, and have a super-awareness of 
ambush, or the threat of ambush, in woods and 
dense forests.

Kai-surge
When using their psychic ability to attack an 
enemy, Grand Masters may add 8 points to their 
COMBAT SKILL. For every round in which Kai-surge 
is used, they need only deduct 1 ENDURANCE point. 
Grand Masters have the option of using a weaker 
form of psychic attack called Mindblast. When 
using this lesser attack, they may add 4 points to
their Combat Skill without loss of ENDURANCE 
points. (Kai-surge, Psi-surge, and Mindblast cannot 
be used simultaneously.)

Grand Masters cannot use Kai-surge if their ENDUR-
ANCE score falls to 6 points or below.

Kai-screen
In psychic combat, Grand Masters are able to con-
struct mind fortresses capable of protecting them-
selves and others. The  strength and capacity of 
these fortresses increases as a Grand Master 
advances in rank.

Grand Nexus
Grand masters are able to withstand contact with 
harmful elements such as flames and acids, for 
upwards of an hour in duration. This ability 
increases as a Grand Master advances in rank.

Telegnosis  (Advanced Divination)
This discipline enables a Grand Master to spirit-
walk for far greater lengths of time, and with far 
fewer ill effects. Duration, and the protection of 
his inanimate body, increases as a Grand Master 
advances in rank.

Magi-Magic
Under the tutelage of Lord Rimoah, you have been
able to master the rudimentary skills of battle 
magic, as taught to  the Vakeros - the native war-
riors of Dessi. These skills include the use of basic
magi-magic spells such as Shield, Power Word, and
Invisible Fist. As you advance in rank, so will your 
knowledge and mastery of Old Kingdom Magic 
increase.

Kai-alchemy
Under the tutelage of Guildmaster Banedon, you 
have mastered the elementary spells of Left-
handed Magic, as practised by the Brotherhood 
of the Crystal Star. These spells iclude Lightning 
Hand, Levitation, and Mind Charm. As you 
advance in rank, so will your Knowledge and mas-
tery of Left-Handed Magic increase, enabling you 
to craft new Kai weapons and artefacts

If you successfully complete the mission as set in 
Book 19 of the Lone Wolf Grand Master series, 
you may add a further Grand Master Discipline of 
your choice to your Action Chart in Book 20.
For every Grand Master Discipline you possess, in
excess of the original four Disciplines you begin 
with, you may add 1 point to your basic COMBAT 
SKILL score and 2 points to your basic ENDURANCE 
points score. These bonus points, together with 
your extra Grand Master Discipline(s), your original 
four Grand Master Disciplines, and any Special 
Items that you have found and been able to keep 
during your adventures, may then be carried over 
and used in the next Grand Master adventure, 
which is called: THe Curse of Naar









Wolf's Bane

GRAND MASTER'S WISDOM

You are about to face an adversary who possesses
skills and abilities commensurate with your own. 
Even though you have returned to Sommerlund,
the land of your birth, you should remain wary and 
on guard at all times. Your enemy is cunning
and ruthless; you can expect no quarter from him
whatsoever.

Some of the things you will encounter during
your adventure will be of use to you in this and
future Lone Wolf books, while others may be red
herrings of no real value at all. If you discover
items, be selective in what you choose to keep.

Pick your four Grand Master Disciplines with care 
for a wise choice will enable any player to complete 
the quest, no matter how weak their initial COMBAT
SKILL and ENDURANCE scores may be. Successful
completion of previous Lone Wolf adventures,
although an advantage, is not essential for the com-
pletion of this Grand Master adventure.

May the light of Kai and Ishir be your guide as you
strive to defeat the agents of Naar.

For Sommerlund and the Kai!Wolf's Bane

EQUIPMENT

Before you set off on your long journey home to 
Sommerlund, you took with you a map of Northern 
Magnamund (see the inside front cover of this 
book) and a pouch of gold. To find out how much 
gold is in the pouch, pick a number from the 
Random Number Table and add 20 to the number 
you have picked. The total equals the number of 
Gold Crowns inside the pouch, and you should 
now enter this number in the 'Gold Crowns' sec-
tion of your Action Chart.

If you have successfully completed any of the 
previous Lone Wolf adventures (Books 1-18), 
you may add this sum to the total sum of 
Crowns you already possess. Fifty Crown is 
the maximum you can carry, but additional 
Crowns can be left in safe-keeping at your 
monastery.

You can take four items from the list below, 
again adding to these, if necessary, any you 
may already possess from previous adven-
tures (remember, you are still limited to two 
Weapons, but you may now carry a maximum 
of ten Backpack items).

BROADSWORD (Weapons)
BOW (Weapons)
QUIVER (Special Items) This contains six arrows; 
record them on your Weapons List.
DAGGER (Weapons)
SWORD (Weapons)
2 MEALS (Meals) Each Meal takes up one space in 
your Backpack.
ROPE (Backpack Item)
POTION OF LAUMSPUR (Backpack Item) This potion restores 
4 ENDURANCE points to your total when 
swallowed after combat. There is enough for only 
one dose.
AXE (Weapons)

List the four items that you choose on your Action
Chart, under the appropriate headings, and make
a note of any effect that may have on your ENDUR-
ANCE points or COMBAT SKILL.

Equipment - How to use it

Weapons
The maximum number of weapons that you can 
carry is two. Weapons aid you in combat. If you 
have the Grand Master Discipline of Grand Wea­
ponmastery and a correct weapon, it adds 5 points 
to your COMBAT SKILL. If you find a weapon during 
your adventure, you may pick it up and use it.

Bows and Arrows
During your adventure there will be opportunities
to use a bow and arrow. If you equip yourself with
this weapon, and you possess at least one arrow, 
you may use it when the text of a particular section 
allows you to do so. The bow is a useful weapon
for it enables you to hit an enemy at a distance. 
However, a bow cannot be used in hand-to-hand 
combat, therefore it is recommended that you also 
equip yourself with a close combat weapon, such 
as a sword or an axe.

In order to use a bow you must possess a quiver 
and at least one arrow. Each time the bow is used, 
erase an arrow from your Action Chart. A bow 
cannot, of course, be used if you exhaust your 
supply of arrows, but the opportunity may arise 
during your adventure for you to replenish your 
stock of arrows.

If you have the Discipline of Grand Weaponmas- 
tery with a bow, you may add 3 points to any
number you choose from the Random Number 
Table, when using the bow.

Backpack Items

These must be stored in your Backpack. Because 
space is limited, you may keep a maximum of ten 
articles, including Meals, in your Backpack at any
one time. You may only carry one Backpack at a 
time. During your travels you will discover various 
items which you may decide to keep. You 
may exchange or discard them at any point when 
you are not involved in combat.

Any item that may be of use, and which can be 
picked up on your adventure and entered on your
Action Chart is given either initial capitals (eg Gold 
Dagger, Magic Pendant), or is clearly identified as
a backpack item. Unless you are told that it is a 
Special Item, carry it in your Backpack.

Special Items
Special Items are not carried in the Backpack. 
When you discover a Special Item, you will be told 
how or where to carry it. The maximum number 
of Special Items that can be carried on any adven­
ture is twelve.


Food
Food is carried in your Backpack. Each Meal 
counts as one item. You will need to eat regularly 
during your adventure. If you do not have any food 
when you are instructed to eat a Meal, you will 
lose 3 ENDURANCE points. However, if you have 
chosen the Discipline of Grand Huntmastery, you 
will not need to tick off a Meal when instructed to 
eat.

Potion of Laumspur
This is a healing potion that can restore 4 ENDUR­
ANCE points to your total when swallowed after 
combat. There is enough for one dose only. If you 
discover any other potion during the adventure, 
you will be informed of its effect. All potions are 
Backpack Items.


Wolf's Bane

RULES FOR COMBAT

There will be occasions during your adventure 
when you have to fight an enemy. The enemy's 
COMBAT SKILL and ENDURANCE points are given in 
the text. Lone Wolf's aim in the combat is to kill 
the enemy by reducing his ENDURANCE points to 
zero while losing as few ENDURANCE points as possi-
ble himself

At the start of a combat, enter Lone Wolf's and 
the enemy's ENDURANCE points in the appropriate 
boxes on the 'Combat Record' section of your 
Action Chart.

The sequence for combat is as follows:

1.    Add any extra points gained through your 
      Grand Master Disciplines and Special Items to 
      your current COMBAT SKILL total.

2.    Subtract the COMBAT SKILL of your enemy from
      this total. The result is your Combat Ratio. 
      Enter it on the Action Chart.

      Example
      Lone Wolf (COMBAT SKILL 32) is attacked by a 
      pack of Doomwolves (COMBAT SKILL 30). He is 
      taken by surprise and is not given the oppor-
      tunity of evading their attack. Lone Wolf has the 
      Grand Master Discipline of Kai-surge to which 
      the Doomwolves are not immune, so Lone Wolf 
      adds 8 points to his COMBAT SKILL, giving him a 
      total COMBAT SKILL of 40.

      He subtracts the Doomwolf pack's COMBAT SKILL 
      from his own, giving a Combat Ratio of +10.
      (40 - 30 = + 10). +10 is noted on the Action Chart 
      as the Combat Ratio.

3.    When you have your Combat Ratio, pick a 
      number from the Random Number Table.

4.    Turn to the COMBAT RESULTS TABLE on the inside
      back cover of this book. Along the top of the 
      chart are shown the Combat Ratio numbers.
      Find the number that is the same as your 
      Combat Ratio and cross-reference it with the 
      random number that you have picked. (The 
      random numbers appear on the side of the 
      chart.) You now have the number of ENDURANCE  
      points lost by both Lone Wolf and his enemy 
      in this round of combat. (E represents points 
      lost by the enemy; LW represents points lost by 
      Lone Wolf.)

      Example
      The Combat Ratio between Lone Wolf and the 
      Doomwolf Pack has been established as +10. If 
      the number taken from the Random Number Table
      is a 2, then the result of the first round of combat 
      is:

      Lone Wolf loses 3 ENDURANCE points (plus an
      additional 1 point for using Kai-surge. This loss
      is in addition to the loss suffered as a result of
      combat.)
      Doomwolf Pack loses 9 ENDURANCE points.

5.    On the Action Chart, mark the changes in
      ENDURANCE points to the participants in the
      combat.

6.    Unless otherwise instructed, or unless you have 
      an option to evade, the next round of combat now
      starts.

7.    Repeat the sequence from Stage 3.

This process of combat continues until ENDURANCE 
points of either the enemy or Lone Wolf are 
reduced to zero, at which point the one with the 
zero score is declared dead. If Lone Wolf is dead, 
the adventure is over. If the enemy is dead, Lone 
Wolf proceeds but with his ENDURANCE points 
reduced.

A summary of Combat Rules appears on the 
page after the Random Number Table.

Evasion of combat
During your adventure you may be given the 
chance to evade combat. If you have already 
engaged in a round of combat and decide to evade, 
calculate the combat for that round in the usual 
manner. All points lost by the enemy as a result of 
that round are ignored, and you make your escape. 
Only Lone Wolf may lose ENDURANCE points during 
that round (but then thatis the risk of running 
away!). You may only evade if the text of that par-
ticular section allows you to do so.

IMPROVED GRAND MASTER
DISCIPLINES

As you rise through the higher levels of Kai Grand 
Mastery you will find that your Disciplines will 
steadily improve. For example, if you possess the 
Discipline of Grand Nexus when you reach the 
Grand Master rank of Grand Thane, you will be 
able to pass freely through Shadow Gates and 
explore the nether realms of Aon and the Daziarn 
Plane.

If you are a Grand Master who has reached the 
rank of Grand Crown, you will now benefit from 
improvements to the following Grand Master Disci­
plines: 

Grand Weaponmastery
Kai Grand Crowns with this discipline are consum-
mate masters of unarmed combat. When fighting
bare-handed ie, without any weapons, they may
add 3 points to their COMBAT SKILL.

Animal Mastery
Grand Crowns with this ability are able to plant in 
the mind of any animal the image of their most­
feared predator or adversary. Under the influence
of this illusion the animal will believe, with all of 
its senses, that it is being confronted by such a 
creature instead of a Kai Grand Crown.

Grand Pathsmanship
Grand Crowns with this skill are able to create 
a clear passageway through dense undergrowth,
forest, or jungle. Once having passed through this
passageway, the plant material will revert to its 
normal state. This skill can also be employed by a 
Kai Grand Crown against magical foliage, or to 
counter any plant material ranged against him by 
an enemy.

Kai-screen
Grand Crowns who possess mastery of this Disci 
pline are able to mask the goodly aura which radi­
ates naturally from their minds and bodies. 
Additionally, Grand Crowns can deliberately alter 
these auras to give a false impression of themselves 
to creatures who are sensitive to such psychic 
auras.

Grand Nexus
Grand Crowns who possess this Discipline are able
to speak a Kai Power Word - a holy utterance 
which will cause physical and psychic damage to 
any single creature within a radius of thirty feet. 
The degree of damage so caused, and the resultant 
drain upon a Grand Crown's reserves of ENDUR­
ANCE, are dependent upon individual circum­
stances. The power and range of this skill increases 
as a Grand Master rises in rank.

Kai-alchemy
Grand Masters who have reached the rank of
Grand Crown are able to use the following
Brotherhood spells:

Teleport - By casting this spell, Kai Grand Crowns 
can transport themselves physically to any place 
which they can see with their own eyes. The spell 
will carry the caster, his equipment and clothing
to his chosen sighted destination. It cannot be used 
on any other living creature and it will not transport 
any other living creature along with the caster. Use 
of this spell will cost the caster between 1 and 5 
ENDURANCE points every time it is used. This cost 
reduces as a Kai Grand Master increases in rank.

See Illusion - Using this spell, a Kai Grand Crown 
is able to detect an illusion and know immediately 
its true identity or purpose.

The nature of any additional improvements and
how they affect your Grand Master Disciplines will
be noted in the 'Improved Grand Master Disci­
plines' section of future Lone Wolf books.

      <p>The jangle of keys and the metallic squeal of a rusty iron drawbolt makes your pulse quicken. Moments later, the heavy dungeon door creaks open and two imperious figures step with caution into the dingy cell.

      <p>'Well met, old friend!' you call out, but Banedon does not return your greeting. His countenance is one of fearful suspicion. Clearly he and the Baron suspect you are the evil impostor who has wrought havoc across Sommerlund.</p>
      <p>'Come now, Banedon. Truly, it is I - Lone Wolf. Won't you release me from these shackles?'</p>
      <p>Banedon takes hold of a crystal pendant that hangs from a chain around his neck and a wave of strong psychic energy washes over you. The sensation is. deeply unpleasant, but you resist the urge to use repel it. Instead, you allow this mental probe to access the recesses of your mind and gradually Banedon's grim expression is replaced by a smile. He nods approv­ ingly and, in an instant, the magical barrier which protects the two men blinks out of existence.</p>

The warrior follows your swift movement and looses a second beam from his spear which slams into the iron chest with stunning force. You gasp with horror as you see the side of the chest bulging towards your face. Its thick rivets tremble and its age-blackened skin smoulders with a sullen heat.

      <p>Guided by a circle of blazing beacons, Javano the pilot lands the skyship expertly in the middle of a paved training park located within the castle's expansive grounds. In Tyso a curfew is in force, and the only figures lawfully abroad this night are Baron Medar's guardsmen whose numbers have been doubled by a regiment of Border Rangers recently arrived from Holmgard. Banedon suggests that you stay on board until he has informed Baron Medar of the true situation.</p>
      <p>'The guards of Tyso are under orders to kill you on sight,' he says, as he gets ready to disembark. 'It would not be wise to show yourself, Grand Master, until I have explained all to the Baron.'</p>

      <p>'You will always be welcome here, Lone Wolf,' he says clasping your hand in friendship. 'I knew in my heart that you were innocent of these crimes which have so shocked our people. You may rely on me to help you find this impostor who has sought to harm us and bring dishonour upon your good name.'</p>
      <p>You thank the Baron for his support and his pledge of loyalty, and you tell him how pleased you are to be in Tyso after the months you have spent abroad.</p>

      <p>The tunnel passes under a street and then surfaces in front of a grand two-storey building, once a busy warehouse that stored braided coils of fine copper cable. You avoid the main entrance in case your adversary is lying in ambush there, and enter instead by way of a flight of iron steps that lead to a second floor window. The moment you set foot inside the building you sense that Wolf's Bane is here. Warily you explore, your nerves stretched to breaking point as your eyes seek out detail in the darkness. You are approaching the west wing of this building when you suddenly catch sight of your opponent through a hole in the floor. He is sitting on his haunches behind a mound of wooden crates, busily eating a green-skinned fruit, and he is unaware that you are watching him.</p>

      <p>You raise your weapon and lash out at the crea- ture's ugly maw. You wound the beast but it only serves to make him more angry. With a jerk of his head, he spits a gout of venom which splashes the front of your tunic and rapidly melts through the cloth to attack your skin.</p>
      <p>Pick a number from the <a idref='random'>Random Number Table</a> (0=10). If you possess the Discipline of Grand Nexus, deduct 2 from the number you have chosen. The resultant score is equal to the number of <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points you lose due to the harmful effects of this creature's highly corrosive saliva.</p>
      <p>Before the beast can spit at you again, you strike a blow which crushes its windpipe and sends it sinking fast to the bottom of the flooded cellar. Free now to continue your pursuit, you climb the steps to emerge amongst the ruins of the city. There is no sign of Wolf's Bane, but when you hurry to where you saw him last, you discover a flight of steps leading down into a wide underground pas- sage. His tracks can be seen clearly imbedded in the muddy floor of this tunnel.</p>
      <p>The tunnel passes under a broad avenue and then surfaces in front of a grand two-storey building. This was once a busy warehouse that stored braided coils of fine copper cable. You avoid the main entrance in case your adversary is lying in ambush there, and enter instead by way of a flight of iron steps that lead to a second floor window. The moment you set foot inside the building you sense that Wolf's Bane is here. Warily you explore, your nerves stretched to breaking point as your eyes seek out detail in the darkness. You are approaching the west wing of this building when you suddenly catch sight of your opponent through a hole in the floor. He is sitting on his haunches behind a mound of wooden crates, busily eating a green-skinned fruit, and he is unaware that you are watching him.</p>

      <p>To the left of the tunnel arch you discover two squares of opaque crimson gemstone separated by a small slot. The squares are similar in size and design to those you encountered at the entrance to the temple of Avaros. These, too, comprise a locking mechanism that controls this portal. By tap- ping upon each square a correct number of times you will cause the lock to disengage and the portal to rise.</p>
      <p>You place your fingers lightly upon the squares and feel the tell-tale vibrations that are the key to deciphering the secret code. After only seconds you are able to determine that the first code is equal to the number of islands south of the Kirlun­ din island of Hemd.</p>
      <p>The second code is equal to the number of villages that lie on the highway between the cities of Toran and Anskaven.</p>

      <p>Suddenly the Bangrol shrieks in agony as a steel- tipped arrow skewers its skull. The force of the impact sends it cartwheeling through the air to crash limply against the chamber wall. You glance to your left and see a grinning Blazer calmly shouldering his bow.</p>
      <p>'Well done, Blazer,' you say, as you sheathe your weapon. 'Your bowmanship's as keen as ever. Those many hours you've spent in the Monastery butts were not in vain, eh!' The young Kai Master smiles his gratitude for your welcome words of praise.</p>
      <p>'Now, my lords, we must press on. We've a trail to find,' you say, and motion your companions to follow as you leave this chamber by a tunnel in its south wall.</p>

      <p>Cautiously you approach the slain warriors. You are eager to examine their strange armour and you are particularly curious about the light-emitting spears they wielded; weapons such as these could prove useful in your fight against Wolf's Bane. However, on examining these steely shafts you discover that they are now useless. The source of their power was contained in the canisters strapped to the warriors' backs, a power that is now depleted.</p>
      <p>When you pose open a helmet and breastplate, you discover a thin, pale-skinned humanoid within. His bone structure and muscularity is surprisingly weak for a warrior, prompting you to suspect that he must have relied heavily on his power-fed armour for strength and protection. This sallow­ faced soldier has a lean and brutal appearance, a look which resembles that of an emaciated Drak- karim.</p>
      <p>After having satisfied yourself that there is nothing worth salvaging from the bodies of these two slain enemies, you make a cursory check of your own equipment. You are hungry, and unless you pos- sess the Discipline of Grand Huntmastery, you must now eat a Meal or lose 3 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points. Having satisfied your curiosity and your appetite, you hurry out of this derelict warehouse by a rear door and continue your hunt for Wolf's Bane's trail.</p>

      <p>The creature's sharp proboscis misses you by inches. Before it can strike again, you prise yourself out of the cluster and retreat back along the stamen until you are out of harm's way. Blindly the giant insect stabs and slashes, splintering stamen tips and drenching you with showers of sticky pollen. Fortu- nately, the span of its gigantic wings and the nar- rowness of the plant's corolla conspire to prevent it from reaching deeper into the plant, and you are able to escape without injury.</p>
      <p>You retreat all the way down to the bowl of the corolla, from where you began your ascent. Look- ing around you see that the hollow stem is now the only remaining chance you have of getting out of this plant alive.</p>

      <p>You approach the hut and crouch down beside its mud wall, close to its open door. Your senses detect no glyphs or other traps here, and there are no residues of magical energy that might betray the presence of illusions or shielding spells. How­ ever, your Kai senses do pick up a strong aura of evil lingering at the rear of the hut, close to the water's edge.</p>
      <p>You move around to the rear of this hovel and discover that the bank is deeply undercut where the soft earth has been eroded by the fast-flowing stream. Standing in a line in the shadow of the undercut are a dozen wooden cages, each contain- ing a fleshless skeleton. A shiver runs down your spine as your Magnakai Discipline of Divination detects the lingering agonies of these luckless victims. They suffered cruelly at the hands of the natives of this settlement before death finally ended their torment. The shock of your discovery is unnerving: lose 1 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> point.</p>
      <p>You leave the stream and return to the front of the hut. Inside the open doorway you discover several fruits stacked in mounds on a mat of woven rushes. Somewhat to your surprise, your senses tell you that they are nutritious and safe to eat. (There are sufficient fruits here for 3 Meals.)</p>
      <p>Wary of further delay, you approach the trench at the centre of the hut. Your tracking skills locate your enemy's tracks leading down the flight of steps, and quickly you follow them into an under- ground tunnel. You have gone only a few yards along this narrow passageway when suddenly you hear the terrifying roar of a large cat. With an abruptness that takes your breath away, a huge tiger-like beast comes bounding from out of the darkness ahead. So sudden and unexpected is this creature's attack, that you only just have enough time to unsheathe a hand weapon as it hurls itself upon you.</p>

      <p>You unsheathe the Sword of the Sun and a shim- mering halo of light engulfs the blade. This golden glow washes over the rubble-strewn steps and illuminates something that, until now, had gone unnoticed.</p>
      <p>Lying across the open doorway to the tomb is a slab of granite. Cautiously you move nearer to inspect a strange mark on its surface which is glint- ing in the light from your sword. You discover that it is an intricate design which has been scratched upon its surface. Someone has gone to the trouble of smearing it with dirt and a magical spell of shield- ing has been placed upon it to disguise its true purpose, yet you immediately realize what it is and you recoil from the slab, hurriedly retreating a dozen paces.

This huge chamber is par- titioned into pens which house several giant dragonflies, similar to those you encountered when first you arrived on Avaros. High above, great oblong sections of the steel roof are open to the elements and the bases of passing storm clouds are lit up by the glow from the hall's phosphorescent lighting. You scan the rainswept pens for sight of your adversary, and find him climbing upon the saddled back of a great crimson dragonfly. He urges the creature into the air and it obeys with stunning swiftness. You watch as Wolf's Bane steers his winged mount once around the roof of the hail, and then, to your horror, you see him bring the creature to hover directly over your head. He shouts at you, but his words are lost in the buzz of the dragonfly's massive wings. Then he leans from the saddle and casts down a metallic box before urging his mount skywards. The box lands close by, bouncing once before coming to rest near your feet. Your heart pounds when you sense that it is a powerful time bomb.

      <p>Nausea wells up from the pit of your stomach as the lower chamber of the tower is suddenly trans- formed into a whirling spiral of violent colours and noise. You feel yourself falling forwards into this vortex and, for a few fleeting seconds, you glimpse your adversary. He is brandishing his sword and laughing like a madman, his face twisted with maniacal glee as he rides this terrifying whirlwind. Then he is lost to the chaos of the maelstrom and he vanishes from your sight.</p>
      <p>For what seems like an eternity you spin and fall through a rainbow of colour and sound. Only gradually do you become aware that this nightmare journey is coming to an end when the noise abates and the swirling colours begin to fade. Then, with a jolt, you find yourself standing ankle-deep in stagnant green water, struggling to keep your bal- ance. You draw your weapon and scan your sur­ roundings, fearful of sudden attack, but you soon realize that you are alone.</p>
      <p>You appear to be under the ground, standing in a crude sewer-like tunnel which has been excavated by primitive means. The roots of trees protrude from its beaten earth ceiling and there is a stale and unpleasant smell of rotting vegetation. You use your psychic skills to probe for Wolf's Bane but you cannot detect his presence, and so you sheathe your weapon and relax your guard. The encounter with the manifestation of Naar has left a fear gnaw­ ing at your heart, the fear that the Dark God could at any moment he chooses lay claim to your soul. But your Kai courage swiftly overcomes the anxiety and you draw comfort from your faith in the Gods Kai and Ishir. You offer up a prayer to them to watch over you during the coming trial of strength, and vow that you will never lose hope, no matter what the dangers you may have yet to face. As if in answer to your prayer you feel a surge of energy flow through your body, revitalizing your mind and senses (restore any <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points which you may have lost during your adventure so far).</p>

      <p>Your blow has ripped a hole in the creature's sil- very wing. The wound is not fatal, but the damage is enough to render the hungry creature incapable of ascending any higher. It emits a loud buzz of frustration which fades as it slowly spirals away towards a cluster of smaller dragonflies hovering near the centre of the gorge.</p>
      <p>Several minutes elapse before your tireless mount reaches the apex of the cavern and soars into the light-filled vent. Upon entering this vast aperture you are buffeted by crosswinds which sweep you and your air-steed precariously close to its rocky lip. The shock of the unexpectedly violent wind causes your mount to circle around the lip and attempt to dive back into the cavern. Blind with fear, it no longer responds to your commands, forcing you to take drastic action to avoid being carried back into the gorge. As you swoop past a rocky outcrop, you leap from the creature's back and abandon yourself to the crosswinds. Only your Kai mastery and your lightning-swift reactions save you from being crushed to death as you are blown towards the jagged, volcanic rock.</p>
      <p>Miraculously, you survive the impact and are able to haul yourself out of the vent and climb safely onto a surface that you assume is the roof of the cavern. Seeking shelter from the raging crosswinds, you squeeze yourself into a hollow in the porous rock from where you are able to take stock of your new surroundings. The sight makes you gasp, for it is a view that truly rivals the fertile wonders of the cavern below.</p>

      <p>You utter the words of the Brotherhood Spell Lightning Hand and loose a power beam of your own at the back of the running warrior. It tears open the canister that is strapped between his shoulder blades and, with a sudden eruption of blue-white light, he is hurled upon the cylinders that cover his slain comrade. For a few seconds a spidery net of pulsating light enshrouds the two lifeless warriors, then it crackles and disappears, leaving behind an acrid stench of scorched metal and roasted meat.</p>

      <p>Black Hawk unsheathes his sword and rests this gleaming band of Sornmlending steel across his forearm, awaiting your signal to proceed. You cast your eyes over the surface of the wall one last time, to satisfy yourself that you can detect no lurking traps, and when you are fully confident that it is safe you nod your head affirmatively. Because you are so sure that there is no threat, what occurs in the next instant is doubly shocking.</p>
      <p>Black Hawk puts the tip of his sword to the hairline crack in the wall and presses forward with all of his weight. But, unexpectedly, he meets with no resistance. His blade disappears into the wall and the young Kai Master stumbles forwards and van- ishes through the seemingly solid granite. For a second or two there is a deathly silence. Then an explosion of white light obliterates your vision and you feel a searing wave of heat buffet your face and body.</p>

      <p>You hear the great portal closing behind the hover- wagon. It makes surprisingly little noise for such a huge expanse of iron, barely a serpent-like hiss as it seals out the stormy city wind. You stay hidden until the wagon comes to a halt and then you venture a glance over the side of its cargo bay to assess the situation.</p>
      <p>Before your eyes there stretches a cavernous plaza, crafted entirely of steel, glass, silver and iron. Towering girders arc over your head, buttressed upon each other to support the many upper levels of this stupendous edifice. The plaza is vast and alien in design, and it is virtually deserted. You count no more than six armoured warriors, some so far distant that you have to magnify your vision to be sure that they are what they seem.</p>
      <p>The arrival of the wagon attracts no attention. The driverless craft has docked of its own accord at a steel jetty that encircles an iron support pillar. The coast is clear and so you waste no time in attempt- ing to locate your adversary's trail. As expected, you find traces of his tracks close to the portal. They lead you to an archway which opens into a steel-lined chamber that has two exits: one to the left, the other to the right.

      <p>With mixed feelings of fear and fascination you force open your eyes and gaze upon your alien surroundings. At first it seems as if you have fallen into a humid, green-walled cell, illuminated by a solitary lantern at the apex of a fluted chimney-like ceiling. Then slowly your mind makes sense of sights and smells and the realization of where you are makes you shiver with dread.</p>
      <p>You have landed inside the corolla tube of some gigantic flower. Huge stamens rise up to the light from the sticky bowl-shaped floor on which you lie, and nearby there is a large, chute-like tunnel which drops away into the plant's hollow stem. For a moment you close your eyes and let your psychic senses explore this strange environment. Your greatest fear is that you have been drawn through the Shadow Gate to the Plane of Darkness, the supernatural realm of Dark God Naar, yet you can detect no abnormally high concentrations of evil. Also, you are unable to sense the presence of your adversary - Wolf's Bane. Your hopes begin to rise when suddenly you realize that you are still some­ where within the material universe of Aon. You are able to determine that this alien place is not your home world, yet you are certain that it is a planet that lies within the same galaxy as Magnamund.</p>

Your adversary's tracks pass through this opulent chamber and end at a pair of stout wooden doors, inlaid with exquisite gold marquetry. You place your ear to one of the doors and concentrate. The only sound you can hear is the crackle of a log fire, but your Kai senses detect the presence of your adversary in the room beyond. You peer through a keyhole and glimpse part of a gallery with a railed parapet. The wooden rails are lit from below by the warming yellow flicker of a fire.</p>
      <p>You reach out to open the doors and confront your enemy, but a strong sense of unease stays your hand. It feels as if a swarm of butterflies are fighting to escape from your churning stomach.

      <p>The moment you complete the code, you feel a shuddering vibration run through the great iron portal. Slowly it grinds open to reveal an ante- chamber that is lit by a dozen flaming torches set around its glassy walls. The wind has now become so fierce that it is tearing the fabric of your cloak and tunic. Rather than remain outside in the storm a moment longer, you hurry through the open portal and seek shelter within.</p>

      <p>You ask Steel Hand to give you his rope and he obeys dutifully. Then you utter the words of the Brotherhood Spell Levitation and almost immedi- ately you feel gravity losing its grip on your body. Gently you rise to the ceiling of the vault where, using the exposed stone buttresses, you are able to pull yourself along until you are directly above the centre of the fissure. Here you fix one end of the rope to an exposed stone beam and cast the other end to your companions wailing below. One by one they swing across the void and, when all have crossed safely, you untie the rope and pull yourself to the far side before intoning the words that cancel the effects of the spell.</p>
      <p>It is clear from their wide-eyed expressions that they are all impressed with your mastery of Brotherhood magic, especially Steel Hand. You gather up his rope and as you give it back to him you say: 'Don't worry. One day I'll instruct you in the ways of magic so that you, too, can walk a ceiling!'</p>
      <p>The young Kai Master smiles as he stuffs his rope into his bulging backpack.</p>
      <p>'And now, my lords, we must press on. We've a trail to find,' you say, and you motion your com­ panions to follow as you get ready to leave this chamber.</p>

The whirling flames of the fire have rapidly trans- formed into a raging vortex which is dragging into its core every loose item in the banquet hall.

Chairs, tapestries, tables and other furniture batter you as they tumble past to be sucked into the vortex (lose 4 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points). Then the rail collapses and the two of you are drawn into the raging heart of this fearsome whirlpool.</p>

      <p>Once outside, you focus your tracking skills and attempt to pick up your enemy's trail. You have a feeling that he may have doubled-back on his tracks and so you retrace your steps to the street where you first appeared in this alien city. As you are nearing this place, you suddenly hear the ringing metallic clang of an iron girder falling from a height. The noise echoes from an alleyway off to your right and immediately you go to investigate.</p>
      <p>At the end of the alley you discover a derelict warehouse. Fire has ravaged its interior and much of the roof has caved in, but amongst the debris you can see that it once stored metal cylinders and coils of wire. You stop at the entrance and listen. Your caution is rewarded when you hear footsteps at the rear of the building. You draw your weapon and enter, using the debris for cover as you inch your way towards the back of the ruined ware- house. You are moving between cover when sud­ denly you see the outline of a human form silhouet- ted against a broken window. Instantly you know that it is not Wolf's Bane: this figure is clad in grey, close-fitting armour and is holding a metallic spear. The realization makes you hesitate, and in that split second of indecision, the armoured figure sees you and raises its spear. A blinding flame ignites at its tip and a beam of white-hot light comes speeding towards your chest.</p>

      <p>The creature that is diving towards you suddenly freezes in mid-air. The morbid fear of death that had gripped your heart quickly evaporates, but you are left with a feeling of deep unease as your senses detect that something extraordinary is taking place around you. The hall has become filled with a deadly silence and everything, including the tongues of flame trailing from the creature's sword, and the blazing fire in the grate, is utterly frozen. It is as if time itself is standing still.</p>
      <p>Wolf's Bane is a frozen statue, his face fixed in the malevolent sneer he was wearing in gleeful anticipation that you were about to meet your doom. You are beginning to think that perhaps you have been killed and that this is life after death, when suddenly you glimpse a blurred movement out of the corner of your eye.</p>
      <p>From the shadows cast by the gallery there steps a young teenage girl. She is dressed in a leather jerkin and threadbare trousers which are cut short at the knees. She is barefoot and appears to be armed only with a mischievous grin.</p>
      <p>'Who&ellips; who are you? Why are you here?' you stammer, dumbly. Casually she walks towards you and reaches up to touch a finger to the frozen fiery sword clutched in the taloned hands of Wolf's Bane's winged minion. There is a gentle Pop! and the creature disappears.</p>
      <p>'I'm Alyss, and I do hate cheats,' she says, as she wanders over to where Wolf's Bane is standing immobile. Cheekily she pokes out her tongue at him and then she spins on her heel to face you.</p>
      <p>'Now, perhaps you can finish what you came here to do, Lone Wolf,' she says, and claps her hands three times. A sudden rush of noise assails your ears and your senses reel as the reality of time comes flooding back into the hall.</p>

Fire rages through the uppermost levels of the tower, and is spreading quickly to those below.</p>

It is then that you sense a faint but lingering aura of evil close to the tunnel floor.</p>
      <p>Closer inspection reveals a trapdoor set into the flagstones. You pull this heavy hatch open and discover a circular chute and a ladder descending into darkness. Your heart misses a beat when you notice fresh tracks on the ladder's iron rungs: at last you have found the impostor's trail.</p>
      <p>Cautiously you lead the descent into the chute, using your powers of infravision to scan for signs of movement in the damp darkness below. After several minutes you reach the bottom of the ladder where you discover a large vaulted chamber. Around its walls are positioned urns and grey stone caskets, each embellished with traces of gold.

      <p>The grating rumble of heavy stone on stone heralds the sudden appearance of the impostor. Like some secret door to a nightmare realm, the entire far wall of this vault is slowly sliding open. Violent tremors shake the floor and orange tongues of flaming gas shoot from the ever-widening gap. Silhouetted in the centre of this fiery portal is a warrior clad in a parody of the robes of a Kai Grand Master. His stature and his facial features bear an uncanny resemblance to your own, yet the two of you are not entirely identical. The eyes of this impostor betray his true nature for they are black and cold; they are like two tiny windows through which you can see the evil lurking deep within his heart.</p>
      <p>The portal crackles and roars like a blazing furnace yet it radiates no heat. You sense powerful magic at work here and you shout a command to your young Kai comrades to prepare themselves for combat. They react as one, their years of training suppressing their fears, and swiftly they draw arms and form up in a protective circle around you. The impostor unsheathes his black-bladed sword and gives vent to a chilling laugh that momentarily drowns the roar of the flames. His cruel laughter fills your head and suddenly the stone walls of the vault seem to writhe and buckle inwards. Your psychic Kai defences resist this illusion and the distortion ceases, yet as it does so you realize that something important has changed. You command your companions to retreat towards the chute but they do not respond. They are completely rigid, frozen immobile like four stone statues.</p>
      <p>'Ha ha ha&ellips;' cackles the impostor, 'so we meet at last, Lone Wolf.' He advances a little nearer and you feel an icy chill wash over you. The body of this bogus Kai lord radiates coldness.</p>
      <p>'How I have enjoyed myself in your guise,' he sneers. 'Let me introduce myself&ellips;I am Wolf's Bane. An apt name don't you think?'</p>
      <p>'What is your purpose?' you growl in reply, your hand poised to draw a weapon in case he should attempt to launch a sudden attack.</p>
      <p>'Why, I've come to kill you, of course,' he retorts, his voice full of contempt. 'There should be but one Grand Master and only I am worthy of such distinction.' The impostor narrows his coal-black eyes and curls back his lip in disdain.</p>
      <p>'And I intend to prove my worthiness, Lone Wolf,' he adds, with quiet menace.</p>
      <p>'How so?'</p>
      <p>'By a duel,' he replies. 'I challenge you to a duel. A fight to the finish. A fight between just you and I, Lone Wolf.'</p>
      <p>'And if I refuse your challenge?' you retort, defiantly.</p>
      <p>'Then your four frail acolytes will die.' The impos­ tor sweeps his sword in a wide arc, as if to empha- size his threat, and the fiery wall at his back begins to change. The plumes of flame twist and spin with increasing speed until the wall is transformed into a swirling vortex. Fear tightens its icy fingers around your throat as you witness the creation of a Shadow Gate - a portal to another plane of existence. At once you know his threat is real. If he were to direct the power of the vortex towards your paralysed companions, they would be helpless to resist. They would be sucked into the Shadow Gate and destroyed.</p>
      <p>'Very well,' you say, 'I accept your challenge.'</p>
      <p>Wolf's Bane gives a triumphant smile and whirls his black sword around his head. Then he dashes the blade to the floor and, in a terrifying instant, a mighty gust of wind tears the two of you off your feet and sends you both hurling into the fiery heart of the dread Shadow Gate.</p>

Unable to catch you, it emits a loud buzz of frustration which slowly fades as it spirals away. You glance down to see it satisfying its appetite in an attack upon a number of smaller dragonflies. From this great height they appear to be no larger than a cluster of colourful dots hovering above the centre of the great gorge.</p>
      <p>After several minutes you reach the apex of the cavern and soar into the light-filled vent.

      <p>The arrow soars over your shoulder and lodges itself in the tangle of vines that hang down in front of the cave mouth. You spring to your feet and swiftly your sharp eyes pinpoint the place where the arrow emerged from the jungle perimeter. When you magnify your vision you see the face of your enemy - Wolf's Bane - partially hidden by a tree. He is cursing you, his teeth showing white against the deep green of the jungle. Then he sees that you have spotted him and he turns and runs, quickly disappearing into the dense undergrowth.</p>
      <p>Determined that you are not going to allow him to escape so easily, you rush forward and give chase.</p>

      <p>Caldar removes his hand from his sword and heaves a sigh of relief. 'Thank Ishir you've returned to us, Grand Master. Perhaps now the evil that has befallen Sommerlund will be avenged.'</p>
      <p>The Baron summons his gaoler who unlocks the shackles that encase your wrists. Then, as the three of you hurriedly ascend from the castle dungeons to the Great Hall, Caldar and Banedon confirm the account of events that you extracted earlier from the gaoler. In addition to these facts you also learn that several days ago an angry mob, composed in the main of soldiers and citizens from Holmgard, marched upon the Kai Monastery. Firestone, the most senior of the New Order Kai, pleaded with the mob for calm. Fortunately they heeded his call and allowed him to send four Kal Masters to Tyso - the city where the impostor was last sighted. Firestone has ordered these four Kai to track down and slay the impostor as quickly as possible.</p>
      <p>You are in no doubt that this impostor is a formi- dable enemy, one who could easily prove more than a match for the four young Kai. Anxious for their safety, you request that you be allowed to ride to Tyso to join with them. Banedon is in agree­ ment, but he suggests a swifter and surer way that you may reach Tyso. Moored to the tower of Baron Caldar's castle is Cloud Dancer - the Guildmaster's skyship - which he places at your disposal. Grate- fully you accept his generous offer.</p>
      <p>You are keen to leave for Tyso without further delay, but before you depart, Baron Caldar offers you the chance td equip yourself with weapons and stores from his well-stocked armoury.</p>

      <p>The shockwave from the blast sends you tumbling backwards into the chamber. Moments later some­ thing heavy falls across your legs, pinning you to the ground. You reach down to pull yourself free and discover that the object that is lying across your legs is Black Hawk. Dazed and trembling, you roll his limp body over and then hurriedly check to see if he is still breathing. Thankfully you dis- cover that he is alive, although he has sustained serious injuries. His hand and sword arm are badly burnt and he is in a state of deep shock.</p>
      <p>Using your Magnakai curing skills, you are able to stabilize his condition and bring him out of shock (in doing so you expend 3 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points). As you help him to his feet you look around and see that the others have been knocked fiat by the blast. They too are now struggling to pull themselves to their feet. Fortunately their physical injuries are minor; their innate Kai skills appear to have spared them from serious injury. However, you sense that your inability to detect that the wall was an explo- sive illusion has taken its toll on their confidence.</p>
      <p>'Our prey is far more cunning than I feared,' you say, reproachfully, 'but we are Kai and we shall rise to the challenge. Our enemy possesses strong magic and he is capable of masking it well. Yet he chooses to use it to wound and weaken our party, not to kill us. Why this should be I do not know. But from now on we cannot entirely trust our senses to protect us. We must proceed with the utmost caution.'</p>
      <p>Beyond where the illusory north wall once stood, you can now see a small antechamber which is wreathed in acrid blue smoke. Gradually this smoke dissipates to reveal a shallow plinth upon which lies a bronze urn. This heavy object rests on its side and a quantity of pale grey ash has spilled from its hinged lid. Cautiously you approach the urn and see that there is an inscription engraved on its side. From this ancient script you learn that the ashes are the last remains of Baroness Garru- len, the wife of Hul - third Baron of Tyso. Glinting half-buried in the ash, you notice a ring encrusted with crimson gemstones (if you wish to keep this Ruby Ring, record it on your <a idref='action'>Action Chart</a> as a Special Item).</p>
      <p>You are righting the urn on its plinth when you hear Steel Hand calling you. He has found something among the rubble which litters the floor at the rear of the antechamber.</p>

      <p>You are eager to confront your enemy, but you are wary of walking into a trap. At first glance he appears to be alone in this circular hall, but then you notice something curious about the hail itself. At the four points of the compass there are rails attached to the walls. Small horizontal platforms are attached to these rails and they move along them in a continuous procession. At the north and the south these platforms ascend through holes in the ceiling; at the west and east the platforms descend through similar holes and continue through other holes cut in the floor. You suspect them to be elevators and your suspicions are con- firmed when suddenly an armoured warrior appears; he is standing on a descending platform and he passes through the hall and continues trav- elling downwards to a level somewhere below.</p>
      <p>Wolf's Bane is standing with his back to you and is examining a panel of glass set into the chamber wall. You magnify your vision and you see that the panel displays an illuminated view of the avenue that approaches the tower. Your adversary is watching and waiting for your approach; clearly he is unaware that you have already gained access to the tower.</p>
      <p>Suddenly, something alerts him to your presence and he spins on his heel, his dark eyes blazing with a mixture of fear and loathing. He sees you at the entrance to the hall and immediately he leaps upon a rising north platform in an attempt to escape from you. Determined not to let him get away again, you enter the hall and jump onto a rising south platform. As the platform passes through the ceiling of the hall, it carries you .up a tall open shaft. Wolf's Bane is on the far side of the shaft wall, some twenty feet above. You can see his face peering over the lip of the platform on which he is standing. He mouths something that you suspect is a curse, but then he points at you with an extended hand and a crackling arc of crimson fire leaps from his fingers and comes twisting down the shaft towards your face.</p>

      <p>You attempt to subdue the giant serpent using your Magnakai Discipline of Animal Control, but the creature is resilient to mental suggestion and it resists your psychic command.</p>

      <p>Alyss commands you to leave at once. The cocoon of light that surrounds her and the Moonstone is beginning to flicker with every blow it sustains from Kekataag's mighty axe. You sense that she cannot maintain her shield for very much longer.</p>
      <p>You heed her cry and race towards the swirling mouth of the Shadow Gate. But Naar is determined to launch one last desperate attempt to prevent you from escaping. You are within ten paces of the gate when two rubbery-limbed horrors emerge from the smoky walls and hurl themselves upon you.</p>

      <p>The fabled Moonstone was created many thousands of years ago by the god-like Shianti, whose presence upon Magnamund heralded the dawn of humanity. This wondrous artifact contains the combined might of all their magic and wisdom, the sum of all their knowledge. So significant was the creation of this artifact that all time on Magnamund is measured from the date of its creation. It had long been held that the Moonstone's location was a secret known only to the remnants of the Shianti, who dwell upon the Isle of Lorn in deepest Southern Magnamund, yet the evidence of your eyes tells you that this mystical stone of power has fallen into the hands of the Dark God.</p>
      <p>Suddenly the significance of the Moonstone becomes clear. Naar is using its legendary powers to generate Shadow Gates within the world of Magnamund, at locations and times of his own choosing. Such power has enabled him to send his loathsome champions to your home world, while the goodly forces of Kai and Ishir are held at bay, helpless to counter them. Only you and your Kai brethren have stood in the way of the onslaught of Naar's agents since the demise of his Darklords.</p>
      <p>The hideous form of the Dark God returns to the dais and settles there uneasily. Then a deep rumble fills the throne hail; it is the prelude to the voice of Naar.</p>
      <p>'You have done well, my champion,' it booms.</p>
      <p>'Now I command you to return to accursed Sommerlund and finish my work. Prepare the way for my armies of night. At last this planet is mine for the taking. My victory is complete!'</p>
      <p>It is clear from his words that Naar is convinced that you are his champion - Wolf's Bane - freshly returned from a duel in which Evil has triumphed. Suddenly you see Alyss emerge from the smoky wall less than a dozen paces behind Naar, yet the Dark God appears unaware of her presence. She appears calm and focussed, and you sense that she is waiting for an auspicious moment to approach the plinth and take the Moonstone. With bated breath you watch as she inches closer and closer to the legendary stone. Then Naar shifts his gruesome bulk and she freezes.</p>
      <p>'Your return to Sommerlund will not be alone, Wolf's Bane. Kekataag the Avenger will accompany you. He has a mission of assassination to complete in Toran, at the Brotherhood of the Crystal Star.'</p>
      <p>Then the Dark God emits a high-pitched whistle and, moments later, a fearsome warrior answers the call. He emerges from the smoky wall and the floor shudders as he strides to the centre of the throne hall.</p>

A dot of daylight appears in the distance which, as you climb towards it, becomes a cluster of bright sunbeams filtering through a curtain of vines. This fringe of emerald streamers conceals the cave mouth entrance to this tunnel. The tunnel itself becomes increasingly humid as you get nearer to the exit. Its dry earth floor has gradually transformed into a slick and treacherous surface which is alive with beetles and centipedes, some as long as daggers.</p>
      <p>Upon reaching the cave mouth, you stop to peer through the hanging vines. Outside, in the fiercely tropical heat, you can see a dense jungle sweltering beneath a blazing sun. It extends in every direction towards a jagged horizon of volcanic mountain peaks. Then your eye is caught by something small and metallic glinting in the mulch of vegetation that carpets the entrance. You pick it up and discover that it is a brass button, engraved with a sun motif. It is identical to the buttons which adorn your own tunic, none of which are missing.

      <p>You regard the distant vent with trepidation. It looks to be so high and so far away that you fear an escape from this world may truly be impossible. In your growing despair, you call upon your divine mentor - the God Kai - for inspiration and, as if in answer to your prayer, you experience a sudden moment of revelation in which a bold plan takes form in your mind's eye.</p>
      <p>Using your innate Magnakai Discipline of Animal Control, you focus on one of the smaller dragonflies that is circling above the fecund blossoms lining the lip of the gorge. Instantly it responds to your silent command and comes soaring down to land in a nearby clearing. Like a tame and obedient horse, this winged creature waits patiently for you to clamber upon its back. Then, once you are in position, it takes to the air with such speed that your stomach feels as if it has been physically torn from your body. Several minutes pass before you fully recover from the shock of the stunningly swift take-off, and are able to sit back and enjoy the spectacular aerial views of the gorge.</p>
      <p>Using your palms and your knees, you quickly discover that you are able to steer the dragonfly towards the distant vent. Unfortunately, your ascent does not go entirely unnoticed. You are close to a mile above the canyon when suddenly your insectile steed attracts the unwanted attention of a larger predatory dragonfly. This predator is bigger and faster than your encumbered mount and, as it circles around him, it is clear that it is simply biding its time, awaiting the best moment to strike.</p>
      <p>You draw your weapon and tighten your grip on your mount's scaly back as the predatory dragonfly swoops down to make its initial attack.</p>

      <p>At the end of the passage you discover another tunnel that leads off to the left. The walls and ceiling of this adjacent passageway are dripping wet, indicating that it passes directly under the stream. You stride along its narrow confines, your shoulders grazing the muddy walls as you advance up a flight of steps which lead to an archway supported by thick wooden beams. Beyond the arch lies a large subterranean chamber that is daubed and decorated with runes and evil insignia. It is a primitive temple and it radiates an aura of evil so vile and malicious that the thought of entering makes your skin crawl.</p>
      <p>On the far side of this unholy place, you see a stone altar standing before a huge boulder that has been crudely chiselled to resemble a grinning human skull. An eerie green glow pulsates from the eye sockets of this great skull-rock, and a mist swirls from its open jaw. Wolf's Bane stands before the altar, an arrogant sneer spreading slowly across his face.</p>
      <p>'I'd expected better sport from you, Lone Wolf,' he chides. 'You disappoint me&ellips; but no matter. Such easy triumph proves the worthiness of my master's cause. I bid you farewell, Lone Wolf. A final farewell.'</p>
      <p>And with these chilling words ringing in your ears, your enemy stretches out both of his hands and takes hold of two iron staves that protrude from the ground on either side of the skull-rock's jaw. He jerks them out of their settings and casts them into the centre of the temple. Then, with a patronising salute, he turns and enters the open jaw, swiftly disappearing into the swirling mist.</p>
      <p>The dull boom of an explosion somewhere in the rock above the ceiling makes your heart miss a beat. Moments later, the walls begin to shake and the floor shudders violently beneath your feet, throwing you off balance. Rock and earth cascade from the roof and fissures tear open the ground. With fear running ice cold in your veins, you begin a desperate race to reach the mouth of the skull-rock before the entire roof collapses and you are buried alive in this doomed temple.</p>

Around its banded neck there is a collar of iron which is attached to a heavy chain. The chain disappears below the surface, keeping the creature a prisoner of this cavern.

      <p>The inside of the tomb is a cold and sombre place, devoid of all life. Its featureless walls glisten with rivulets of moisture and the air is dank and evil smelling, like the breath of some cold-blooded reptile. At its centre, where one would have expected to find the remains of the nobleman who long ago was incarcerated here, there is instead a yawning shaft. An ancient bronze ladder is fixed to the shaft wall which descends to an unknown depth.</p>
      <p>Using your Kai senses, you scan the tomb and detect lingering traces of the impostor. His trail leads directly to the ladder. After satisfying yourself that your quarry has left behind no unwelcome surprises, you step onto the ladder and begin a slow descent into the shaft.</p>

      <p>The moment you pass into the mouth of the skull-rock you are engulfed by a dense fog that is icy-cold and impenetrable to your sight and senses. You strain your Kai skills to aid your pursuit of Wolf's Bane, but all to no avail; this ivory-white fog hides everything, swamping and distorting all sense of time and direction.</p>
      <p>You keep moving, forcing yourself onwards even though the surface beneath your feet has become viscous and uncertain. After what seems like an eternity spent wandering through this cloudy limbo, you gradually feel the ground hardening and sense that the impenetrable fog is beginning to dissipate. Patches of grey appear in the creamy whiteness. Then the fog dissolves completely and you find yourself standing in the middle of a rubble-strewn street, surrounded by the bleak and derelict dwellings of a decaying, alien city.</p>
      <p>It is the dead of night and a fine drizzle falls from a storm-laden sky, dampening this dreary landscape. Everywhere you look you see the hollow shells of buildings. They are heaped with mounds of broken stone, twisted rusty iron, and shattered glass. There are no trees, no blades of grass, no animals here. Everything is cold, grey, and dead.</p>
      <p>Suddenly you sense a blur of movement beside a mountain of rubble which blocks the end of the street. You focus upon it, magnifying your vision to penetrate the damp gloom, and you are rewarded with a fleeting glimpse of Wolf's Bane. He is running away. You hurry after him and, as you crest the mound, you see him entering the shattered entrance to a three-storey dwelling close by.</p>

Runes of alien design run around the seamless glassy walls and the air is heavy with the sweet smell of decay.

Close by your feet you see the outline of your weapon and you stoop to retrieve it. (If you were holding a normal weapon when you passed through the wall, you discover it has been destroyed by the blast: delete this weapon from your Weapons List.

However, you sense that your inability to detect that the wall was an explosive illusion has severely shaken their confidence.</p>
      <p>'Our prey is far more cunning than I feared,' you say, reproachfully, 'but we are Kai and we shall rise to the challenge. Our enemy possesses strong magic and he is capable of masking it well. Yet he chooses to use it to wound and weaken our party, not to kill us. Why this should be I do not know. But from now on we cannot entirely trust our senses to protect us. We must proceed with the utmost caution.'</p>
      <p>Beyond where the illusory north wall once stood, you can now see a small antechamber which is wreathed in acrid blue smoke. Gradually this smoke dissipates to reveal a shallow plinth upon which lies a bronze urn. This heavy object rests on its side and a quantity of pale grey ash has spilled from its hinged lid. Cautiously you approach the urn and see that there is an inscription engraved on its side. From this ancient script you learn that the ashes are the last remains of Baroness Garrulen, the wife of Hul - third Baron of Tyso. Glinting half-buried in the ash, you notice a ring encrusted with crimson gemstones (if you wish to keep this Ruby Ring, record it on your <a idref='action'>Action Chart</a> as a Special Item).</p>

      <p>The passage beyond the fissure twists and turns like an angry snake. Gradually this winding tunnel bears eastwards and descends by slope and stair into deeper levels of the catacombs. During your long trek you detect not a single trace of the imposter and, when eventually the tunnel comes to a dead end, you curse your ill luck. Reluctantly you decide to retrace your steps. It is only then that you sense a faint but lingering aura of evil close to the tunnel floor.</p>
      <p>A closer inspection reveals a trapdoor set into the grimy flagstones. You pull this heavy hatch open and discover a circular chute and a ladder descending into darkness. Your heart misses a beat when you notice fresh tracks on the ladder's iron rungs; at last you have found the impostor's trail.</p>
      <p>Cautiously you lead the descent into the chute, using your powers of infravision to scan for signs of movement in the damp darkness below. After several minutes you reach the bottom of the ladder where you discover a large vaulted chamber. Around its walls are positioned urns and grey stone caskets, each embellished with traces of gold. There is an unexpected air of opulence about this vault which prompts you to guess that it is a secret burial tomb.</p>

      <p>The steps lead down to a tunnel that is dark and narrow. You sense danger ahead and, using your infravision, you detect Wolf's Bane standing at the far end of this passageway, some thirty yards distant. He is holding a long piece of rope which trails back along the tunnel towards you. You follow its course and see that it is attached to a wooden peg which holds secure the door to a cage set flush into the tunnel wall. You focus on the door and sense that the cage beyond is occupied by a large and ferocious carnivore. Wolf's Bane utters a chilling laugh as he whips the rope to dislodge the peg. But you focus on the peg and, using your Magnakai Discipline of Nexus, you cause it to jam. Your adversary curses you and casts aside the rope in frustration. Then he turns and disappears into a tunnel which meets this main passageway from the left.</p>

Brilliant sparks and flashes of colour illuminate this funnel of darkness as items of furniture from the banquet hall explode and disintegrate, unable to withstand the extraordinary pressures generated by this cosmic whirlpool.

Then, gradually, the spin of the vortex becomes less fierce and you feel the centrifugal pull on your body easing. Beams of light penetrate the darkness and you see Alyss glide into view.

She looks as if to her this whole terrifying journey is nothing more than an irritating inconvenience.</p>

      <p>Kekataag the Avenger is attired in battle armour that glimmers like slime-dulled gold. Beneath his helmet there is a hollow skull-face from which emerges a sickly stench that permeates even the foul air of this hall. The skulls and bones of humans bedeck his armoured hide and in his mighty hands he carries a great two-handed axe, its blade stained black with the blood of his countless victims.</p>
      <p>This fearsome warrior holds you with his glowing eyes and you feel waves of powerful psychic energy buffet your mind. Your advanced Kai defences repel this attack, but you are left in no doubt that he is deeply jealous of your supposed defeat of Lone Wolf.</p>

      <p>By the time the wagon reaches the windswept moat, you have concealed yourself in amongst its cargo of steel cylinders and bales of wire.

Swiftly the wagon passes across the semi-transparent bridge and glides through the tower's open portal unchallenged.</p>

You have triumphed in combat, yet the creature's death has thwarted your chances of escaping this way.

      <p>You approach the hut and crouch down beside its mud wall, close to its open door. Your senses detect no glyphs or other traps here, and there are no residues of magical energy that might betray the presence of illusions or shielding spells. However, your Kai senses do detect a strong aura of evil lingering at the rear of the hut, close to the water's edge.</p>
      <p>You move around to the rear of this hovel and discover that the bank is deeply undercut where the soft earth has been eroded by the fast-flowing stream. Standing in a line in the shadow of the undercut are a dozen wooden cages, each containing a fleshless skeleton. A shiver runs down your spine as your Magnakai Discipline of Divination detects the lingering agonies of these luckless victims. They suffered cruelly at the hands of the natives of this settlement before death finally ended their torment. The shock of your discovery is unnerving: lose 1 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> point.</p>
      <p>You leave the stream and return to the front of the hut. Inside the open doorway you discover several fruits stacked in mounds on a mat of woven rushes. Somewhat to your surprise, your senses reveal that they are nutritious and safe to eat. (There are sufficient fruits here for 3 Meals.)</p>
      <p>Wary of further delay, you approach the trench at the centre of the hut and descend a flight of steps that lead down to an underground tunnel. You can detect no traps, yet you have gone only a few yards along this narrow passageway when you hear the terrifying roar of a large cat. With an abruptness that takes your breath away, a huge tiger-like beast comes bounding from out of the darkness ahead. So sudden and unexpected is this creature's attack, that you only just have time in which to unsheathe a hand weapon as it hurls itself upon you.</p>

      <p>The sudden shock of impact nearly knocks you off the back of your flying steed. Frantically you scramble to regain your seat and, as you pull yourself upright, you notice that the enemy is now more than a hundred feet below; the momentum of its attack has carried it deeper into the cavern.</p>
      <p>Your mount seizes its slim advantage and climbs as fast as it can to get away from the larger dragonfly. The enemy circles about, as if preparing to pursue, then it emits a loud buzz and changes its course. You watch with relief as it spirals away towards a cluster of smaller dragonflies that are hovering near the centre of the gorge.</p>
      <p>Several minutes elapse before your tireless mount reaches the apex of the cavern and soars into the light-filled vent. Upon entering this vast aperture you are buffeted by crosswinds which sweep you and your air-steed precariously close to its rocky lip. The shock of the unexpectedly violent wind causes your mount to circle around the lip and attempt to dive back into the cavern. Blind with fear, it no longer responds to your commands, forcing you to take drastic action to avoid being carried back into the gorge. As you swoop past a rocky outcrop, you leap from the creature's back and abandon yourself to the mercy of the crosswinds. Only your Kai mastery and your lightning-swift reactions save you from being crushed to death as you are blown towards the jagged, volcanic edge.</p>
      <p>Miraculously, you survive the impact and are able to haul yourself out of the vent and climb safely onto a surface that, you assume, is the roof of the cavern. Seeking shelter from the raging crosswinds, you squeeze yourself into a hollow in the porous rock from where you are able to take stock of your new surroundings. The sight makes you gasp, for it is a view to rival the fertile wonders of the cavern below.</p>

He is clutching at his injured leg as he weaves and swerves to avoid the debris which litters his escape route.

      <p>You pocket the disc and give chase. Despite his wounded leg, your adversary is more familiar with this treacherous cityscape and he widens the gap between you. Soon you have lost sight of him completely. However, he cannot shake you off his trail, and you have no difficulty following his tracks as they leave the building and wend their way across a desolate wasteland beyond. You follow his footprints to a gutted building, several storeys high, which is adorned with strangely angular gargoyles. The inside of this crumbling edifice is completely empty and your adversary's trail passes through it to a rear exit. As you emerge on the far side, you catch your first breathtaking glimpse of this grim city's tallest structure.</p>
      <p>It is a great tower of gleaming black stone which rises from the depths of a fathomless moat and soars to within a hundred feet of the stormy grey clouds. Its pitted surface bristles with metal discs and antennae, streaked with rust, yet there are few windows and you can see but one portal. Wolf's Bane is limping towards it. He approaches the deep trench that rings the tower's base and, as he halts at the edge, a semi-transparent drawbridge extends from beneath the portal. It resembles a flattened beam of solid, green-grey light. This beam bridges the moat and provides your enemy with a means to reach the open tower door.</p>
      <p>Powerless to stop him, you can only stand and watch as he crosses the moat and disappears into the tower. At first glance this stronghold looks to be impregnable, but you have gained access to far tougher fortresses in the past and you do not allow your spirits to be dampened by the difficult task of finding a way into this one.</p>

Then, finally, the energy that is contained within the canister is expended. Released from his torment, he loses his balance and falls heavily to the floor.</p>
      <p>You shoulder your bow and move to descend from the top of the storage tank, but you freeze when you see a second warrior running to where the first has fallen. As he passes beneath the tank, you leap onto his back and bring him crashing to the ground. To your shocked surprise you discover that he is an exceptionally strong opponent. He draws power from the armour he wears and he uses it to break your grip. In desperation you utter the words of the Old Kingdom spell Energy Grasp and use it to discharge a powerful pulse of energy into the fabric of his armour. The effect is devastating. His armour disintegrates, crushing him to death as it crumples and compresses his body.</p>

      <p>The rasping growl of the metal wolf is steadily getting louder. The sinister sound makes your palms slick with cold sweat as you feverishly examine the door and the locking mechanism set into the wall nearby.</p>

You place your fingers lightly upon the squares and feel the telltale vibrations that are the key to deciphering their secret code. Aided by your Kai skills, you are able to determine that the first code is equal to the number of named Kirlundin islands north of Egen.

      <p>The moment the rock passes over the glyph there is a blinding flash of white light, followed almost instantly by the deafening crackle of exploding electrical energies. Splinters of stone ricochet from the gravestone behind which you and your fellow Kai have wisely taken cover, and the stench of scorched earth and ozone assails your nostrils.</p>
      <p>Then, abruptly, the noise and light cease and the burial ground is shrouded once more in gloomy silence. You peer over the gravestone to see that the doorway is now clear of rubble, save for the slab upon which the glyph is inscribed.

      <p>You lower yourself through the hole in the floor and quickly give chase. Wolf's Bane sprints through the ruined building, leaping obstacles with a catlike grace that rivals your own legendary agility. He is more familiar with this treacherous cityscape and, despite your best efforts, he soon widens the gap between you until you lose sight of him completely. Yet he cannot shake you off his trail, and you have no difficulty following his tracks as they leave the building and wend their way across the desolate wasteland beyond. You follow his footprints to a gutted building, several storeys high, which is adorned with strangely angular gargoyles. The inside of this crumbling edifice is completely empty and your adversary's trail passes through it to a rear exit. As you emerge on the far side, you catch your first breathtaking glimpse of this grim city's tallest structure.</p>
      <p>It is a great tower of gleaming black stone which rises from the depths of a fathomless moat and soars to within a hundred feet of the stormy grey clouds. Its pitted surface bristles with metal discs and antennae, streaked with rust, yet there are few windows and you can see but one portal. Wolf's Bane is running towards it. He approaches the deep trench that rings the tower's base and, as he halts at the edge, a semi-transparent drawbridge extends from beneath the portal. It resembles a flattened beam of solid, green-grey light. This beam bridges the moat and provides your enemy with a means to reach the open tower door.</p>
      <p>Powerless to stop him, you can only stand and watch as he crosses the moat and disappears into the tower. At first glance this stronghold looks to be impregnable, but you have gained access to far tougher fortresses in the past and you do not allow your spirits to be dampened by the difficult task of finding a way into this one.</p>

      <p>The Baron escorts you and Banedon through the echoing corridors of his castle, past watchful ranks of court guards and Border Rangers, to a hall which is lavishly furnished with Durenese oak and rare silken tapestries. Awaiting you there are a group of young men attired in hooded grey cloaks and close-fitting tunics. You recognize them immediately for they are four of your most promising students - Kai Masters Black Hawk, Star Lynx, Blazer and Steel Hand.</p>
      <p>'Praise Ishir you've returned to us, Grand Master!' says Black Hawk, laying his right hand across his chest in a formal Kai salute. His companions breathe an audible sigh of relief as they, too, salute you and bow in deference to your rank.</p>
      <p>'Stand easy, my lords,' you say, smiling as you motion them to relax. 'It warms my heart and gives me strength to be with you again.'</p>
      <p>'We have heard the Guildmaster's account,' says red-haired Blazer, 'and we await your orders, my lord. Upon your command we will find the impostor and avenge the honour of the Kai.'</p>
      <p>You are about to give your answer when a court herald announces the unexpected arrival of Lord Foilan, Reeve-lieutenant of Tyso, the man charged with keeping law and order in the city. Upon entering the hall he is momentarily taken aback by the sight of you standing at the Baron's side.</p>
      <p>'Calm yourself, Foilan,' says Baron Medar, 'this is the true Lone Wolf, not the impostor who stalks our land. What news have you?'</p>
      <p>'Sire&ellips; the Kai impostor has been sighted within the hour by rangers in the city's North Quarter. They tried to take him captive but he slew two and wounded three of their number before escaping into the old necropolis. The city watch now have both entrances to the necropolis secure - he will not be permitted to escape.'</p>
      <p>'Very good, my lord,' retorts the Baron, 'so we have him cornered.'</p>
      <p>'If he's gone to ground in the old necropolis,' says Banedon, 'he'll be hard to track down. The catacombs of that ancient burial field are vast. It could take months to search them all.'</p>
      <p>'Never fear,' you say confidently. 'With the help of my able young Kai Masters I shall track and trap this impostor before dawn.'</p>
      <p>'Aye, my lord,' pipes Star Lynx, elated by the thought of the hunt, 'we'll flush this cur from his hole before sunrise and bring him to justice.'</p>
      <p>Guided by Lord Foilan, you take your leave of Banedon and Baron Medar and depart from the castle on horseback, accompanied by your eager Kai. During your ride through the twisting, lantern­lit streets of Tyso, you learn from Foilan that there are only two ways in and out of the city's old necropolis: by its South Gate or by its Western Arch.</p>
      <p>'The impostor fled into the burial ground by the South Gate, my lord,' says Foilan, 'but that was more'n an hour ago. He'll be deep un'erground by now.'</p>

      <p>Before your disbelieving eyes there spreads a vast volcanic landscape, punctuated by mountainous dunes of blue-grey sand and columns of towering rock. The amber sky is mottled and banded, like the eye of an angry tiger, and within its fathomless reaches you count twelve multi-coloured moons. These glowing spheres cast their light upon the burnt and crusty soil, lending it a ghostly aspect. Thick clouds, black and turgid, swollen with humid vapours, rear up like shadowy castles upon the far horizon. You can feel coarse grains of sand in the stinging crosswinds and your senses warn that a storm is fast approaching.</p>
      <p>Seeking safer shelter from the coming storm, you get to your feet and cast your eyes across this warm yet unwelcoming land. Away to your right, lying less than a mile distant within a shallow basin of age-worn rock, you see a monstrous temple crafted from opaque black glass. Spikes of crystal embellish its many tiers and atop its highest level there stands a tower, tall and sleek.</p>
      <p>A square of yellow light marks an open portal at the tower's base. You glimpse something standing in the doorway and, when you magnify your vision, you see that it is a cloaked warrior silhouetted against the portal's fiery glow. Your pulse quickens the instant you recognize the warrior. It is your accursed adversary - Wolf's Bane.</p>
      <p>The compelling urge to move northwards, that you felt shortly after you broke free from the plant stem, returns to haunt your senses. You feel drawn towards the temple as if you are being summoned by a force beyond this world. Your sixth senses scream danger, and every fibre of your being knows it should resist, but you suppress these natural instincts and set off towards the temple. This towering edifice holds many dangers, of that you are in no doubt, yet bravely you resolve to confront and overcome them. Only by doing so can you hope to triumph over your enemy and find a way back to your home world of Magnamund.</p>
      <p>During your difficult trek to the temple, unless you possess the Discipline of Grand Huntmastery you must eat a Meal or lose 3 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points.</p>

      <p>The doors swing open onto a gallery which encircles three sides of a large banquet hall. Below, through the wooden spindles of the gallery's parapet rail, you can see the hall itself. Tapestries drape the walls and a blazing fire crackles in a great stone fireplace that occupies much of the north wall. Your adversary is sitting alone in a throne-like chair at the head of a long banqueting table. A plain, oblong-shaped wooden case lies closed on the table before him.</p>
      <p>'Welcome, Lone Wolf - so glad you could join me,' he says, his voice oozing sarcasm as he gets to his feet and tilts his head condescendingly towards the gallery. You see his right hand move below the edge of the table and, moments later, you hear the double doors swing shut and lock behind you. Anxiously you cast your eyes around the hall, searching out his hidden accomplices.</p>
      <p>'We're alone,' snaps Wolf's Bane. He raises a hand and beckons you to descend the gallery stairs to the hall below. 'The time has come, Lone Wolf. Our jaunt across Avaros has been leading to this moment of truth.'</p>
      <p>Wolf's Bane reaches out to the slim case that is laid on the table before him and he flips open its lid. Inside you see two thin-bladed duelling rapiers couched on a velvet liner.</p>
      <p>'We two are as equally matched as these fine blades,' he says, in a voice as syrupy as rancid molasses. 'Come, Lone Wolf. I challenge you to duel honourably. Come and choose your weapon and let fate decide who of us will triumph this day.'</p>
      <p>You magnify your vision and scrutinize the open case. Your senses confirm that these swords are finely crafted blades. They are not booby-trapped, nor are they magically cursed in any way.</p>

      <p>This lock looks similar to that which operates the door to the temple of Avaros, yet there is one important difference. The mechanism of this lock is genuinely protected by a powerful spell, shielded also by magic to prevent its detection. Your unsuccessful attempt to open the portal triggers this spell and causes a massive bolt of electrical energy to be discharged through your fingers, along your outstretched arm, and deep into your body.</p>
      <p>A blinding flash of light obliterates your vision and an agonising pain explodes in your chest. The pain quickly fades, but it is replaced by a terrifying numbness. You feel weightless, as if you are falling through deep space. Briefly you try to resist this sensation but it is no use. You are falling into a sleep from which you will never awaken.</p>

      <p>The huge dragonfly swoops down like a hunting hawk and attempts to skewer you upon the sharp tip of its spear-like proboscis. You wait until the very last moment before twisting aside to avoid its lunge and, as it streaks past, you deal it a backhanded blow which tears a hole in its silvery wing. The wound is not fatal, but the damage to its wing is enough to render the hungry creature incapable of ascending any higher. It emits a loud buzz of frustration which fades as it slowly spirals away towards a cluster of smaller dragonflies hovering near the centre of the gorge.</p>
      <p>At length you reach the apex of the cavern and soar into the light-filled vent. Upon entering this vast aperture you are buffeted by crosswinds which sweep you precariously towards its rocky lip. Only your Kai mastery and your lightning-swift reactions save you from being crushed to death as you are blown towards its jagged, volcanic edge.</p>
      <p>You survive the impact and are able to haul yourself out of the vent and climb safely onto a surface that you assume to be the roof of the cavern. Seeking shelter from the raging crosswinds, you squeeze yourself into a hollow in the porous rock from where you are able to take stock of your new surroundings. The sight makes you gasp, for it is a view that truly rivals the fertile wonders of the cavern below.</p>

      <p>Before you stands a great tower of gleaming black stone which rises from the depths of a fathomless moat and soars to within a hundred feet of the stormy grey clouds. Its pitted surface bristles with metal discs and antennae, streaked with rust, yet there are few windows and you can see but one portal.</p>
      <p>You magnify your vision and note that your adversary's tracks lead to a traffic-worn area on this side of the moat, directly opposite the portal. You watch this area for several minutes, and then you see two armour-clad warriors emerge from the ruins and approach it. Suddenly a semi-transparent drawbridge extends from beneath the portal. It resembles a flattened beam of solid, green-grey light, and this beam bridges the moat and provides the two warriors with the means to reach the open tower door.</p>
      <p>You scan the great tower with your senses and you feel sure that your opponent is lurking somewhere within. Powerless to reach him, you can only stand and watch the two warriors as they cross the moat and disappear into the portal, which slides shut behind them. At first glance this stronghold looks to be impregnable, but you have gained access to far tougher fortresses in the past and you refuse to allow your spirits to be dampened by the daunting task of finding a way into this one.</p>

      <p>By the time you reach the base of the temple, the storm is howling like a vengeful demon in your ears. Stinging blasts of hot, sand-laden wind whip your face mercilessly and you are forced to lean almost horizontally into the storm to maintain your balance. The storm is increasing in ferocity by the minute. You are sorely aware that you must find cover within an hour at most or you will perish in this hellish blizzard.</p>
      <p>An empty parapeted stairway ascends from the temple's lowermost tier to the portal of its crowning tower. The parapet offers you protection from the wind and you climb the many steps bent over, almost on your hands and knees, in order to stay out of the abrasive storm. Before you ascend the last tier, you check to make sure that your adversary is not lying in ambush. The portal is now closed and you can sense no living creature nearby, yet you unsheathe your weapon from your belt and hold it ready in case danger should come from an unsuspected quarter.</p>
      <p>When you reach the portal, you discover that it comprises a seamless sheet of lead-lined iron, many inches thick. You detect a lingering aura of magic around its threshold which makes you wary that a trap may have been set. Yet when you summon your psychic skills to probe deeper, you sense otherwise. You detect that Wolf's Bane has deliberately cast an illusion of magic around this portal, no doubt in the hope that it will delay or deter you long enough for the storm to do its work. Confident that the door is not lethal, you examine it more closely. Set flush into the glassy surface of its surrounding arch, you discover an inscription above two squares of dull crimson gemstone. Your sixth senses reveal that by tapping upon each square a correct number of times you will cause the door to open. Cautiously you place your fingers lightly upon the squares and feel the gentle vibration of the door's locking mechanism. By concentrating on these vibrations you hope to be able to decipher its locking codes.</p>

Aching with fatigue (lose 4 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points), you lie on the solid flagstones for several minutes until you regain sufficient strength to be able to continue your hunt for Wolf's Bane.</p>
      <p>You can feel a warm breeze wafting along this hall and you sense that it comes from a stairwell at the far end. When you investigate it, you rediscover Wolf's Bane's footprints on the stone steps. You cast your hands over them and detect that this is not a false trail: your enemy passed this way sometime within the last hour.</p>
      <p>Slowly you ascend the stairs and arrive at the arched entrance to a large, vaulted stone chamber. Gathered around a fountain set into its north wall are a group of six grey-skinned humanoids. They are busy drinking a clear, oily fluid that pours from the fountain's spout into a semi-circular trough. All are barefoot and clad in rags, and they are each armed with a spear and a bow. The only exit from this chamber appears to be an archway set high in the north wall. There is a balcony in front of it that can only be reached by two flights of stairs which rise up on either side of the fountain.</p>
      <p>Quietly you observe the creatures slaking their thirsts, and you try to formulate a way in which you can get past them and reach the balconied exit in the north wall.</p>

      <p>Baron Caldar escorts you and Banedon to the roof of his castle's main tower where, hovering above, you see the great gleaming hull of the Guildmaster's skyship - Cloud Dancer. At Banedon's signal a cage is lowered from the stern of this magical vessel and, after bidding farewell to the Baron, you are both hoisted aboard. The crew, some of whom are survivors from his previous skyship - Skyrider - are clearly agitated by your unexpected appearance; the sibilant hiss of their fearful whispers echoes softly along the deck. But immediately Banedon vouches that you are not the impostor who has terrorized Sommerlund these past few weeks and this swiftly allays his crew's suspicions. As you accompany the Guildmaster to his quarters, the mood of the men and dwarves of the ship's complement changes. Respectfully they salute you and welcome you with pride aboard their wondrous craft.</p>
      <p>The Cloud Dancer sets sail and follows a south­westerly bearing for the city of Tyso, over one hundred miles distant. The night sky is clear and Javano, the ship's pilot, is confident that you will arrive within the hour. During the brief voyage, Banedon communicates magically with the elders of his Brotherhood in Toran. He informs them of your safe return and tells them of your plans to track down the impostor. In response they assure him that word of your return will be conveyed at once to the King in Holmgard, and to your beleaguered kinsmen at the Kai Monastery. This glad news does much to lift your bruised spirits.</p>
      <p>It seems as if you have been aboard the Cloud Dancer for no more than a few minutes when a message arrives from the forward lookout: 'Tyso lights due south'. You leave Banedon's comfortable quarters below deck and accompany him to the prow rail from where you catch your first aerial glimpse of the distant city-port. The warm lantern light of hovels and taverns shimmers like a captive cluster of stars within the city's protective wall. At the Guildmaster's command, Javano begins the skyship's descent and, as the twinkling lights loom larger, you are able to make out the silhouette of a grand castle that is perched on a headland overlooking the harbour.</p>
      <p>'There's our destination, Lone Wolf,' says Banedon, cheerfully, 'the castle of Baron Tor Medar - the Seneschal of Tyso.'</p>

      <p>The creature that is diving towards you suddenly freezes in mid-air. The morbid fear of death that had gripped your heart quickly evaporates, but you are left with a feeling of deep unease as your Kai senses detect that something extraordinary is taking place around you. The hall has become filled with a deadly silence and everything, including the tongues of flame trailing from the creature's sword, and the blazing fire in the grate, is utterly frozen. It is as if time itself is standing still.</p>
      <p>Wolf's Bane is a frozen statue, his face fixed in the malevolent sneer he was wearing in gleeful anticipation that you were about to meet your doom. You are beginning to think that perhaps you have been killed and that this is life after death, when suddenly you glimpse a blurred movement at the corner of your eye.</p>
      <p>From out of the shadows cast by the gallery steps a young teenage girl, dressed in a leather jerkin and threadbare trousers. You recognize her at once - it is Alyss, the strange enigmatic creature who helped you once before, during your confrontation with the Demoness Shamath.</p>
      <p>'Wh&ellips; what are you doing here?' you stammer. Casually she walks towards you and reaches up to touch a finger to the frozen fiery sword clutched in the taloned hands of Wolf's Bane's winged minion.</p>
      <p>'Why, doing what I like doing best,' she replies, airily, 'minding other people's business.'</p>
      <p>She prods the frozen sword with the tip of her finger and there is a gentle Pop! Instantly the creature disappears.</p>
      <p>'I do hate cheats,' she says, as she wanders over to where Wolf's Bane is standing immobile. Cheekily she pokes out her tongue at him and then she spins on her heel to face you.</p>
      <p>'Now, perhaps you can finish what you came here to do, Lone Wolf,' she says, and claps her hands three times. A sudden rush of noise assails your ears and your senses reel as the reality of time comes flooding back into the hall.</p>

      <p>The thick, trunk-like stamen is covered with fine hairs which help you to make the long climb towards the amber-coloured light far above. However, as you get nearer to the light, the stamen hairs become coated with lumps of sticky, sweet­smelling yellow pollen. These pollen clusters hamper your progress as you have to struggle to unglue yourself from them every time you shift your position.</p>
      <p>You are nearing the stamen's bud-like top when you become aware of a distant buzzing sound. Rapidly the noise gets louder until you are suddenly plunged into semi-darkness. A huge winged insect is hovering directly above you, its multi­coloured body blotting out most of the pale amber sky. It lunges back and forth with its great head as it sucks away clumps of pollen from surrounding stamens with its long, spear-like proboscis. Then the creature detects your presence and the deafening noise of its wings changes pitch. It rises several feet above the stamen and hovers there for a few moments while it studies you with massive composite eyes. Unfortunately it takes only a few seconds for the creature to decide that it wants to vary its diet of pollen. With a sinister nod of its head, it extends its proboscis and then stabs its sticky point towards your unprotected back.</p>

      <p>She then takes a piece of limestone from her pocket and proceeds to draw a pentagram on the floor of the hall. She has half-completed the complicated design when suddenly she becomes agitated.</p>
      <p>'Must hurry,' she mumbles, 'must, must hurry.'</p>
      <p>Suddenly the fire in the hearth flares brightly. The flames begin to grow and whirl and slowly change colour.</p>
      <p>'It's no good!' cries Alyss, tearful with frustration. Angrily she casts her chunk of crumbling limestone at the roaring flames and then leaps to her feet and comes rushing to your side. 'It's too late!' she screams, her voice now barely audible above the unnatural crackling of the fire, 'Naar is summoning his champion!'</p>

      <p>From the uppermost reaches of the tower there descends an icy fog which radiates an intensely powerful aura of evil. This menacing mist darkens as it swirls around the lower levels, like some huge vaporous snake seeking out its prey. Then, slowly, it gathers in towards the centre of the chamber where it hangs above the plinth like an angry thunderhead, roiling and seething with colossal malevolence.</p>
      <p>You gaze into this black cloud and are gripped by an abject terror the instant you fathom its nature and purpose. This cloud is not of this world and it has not fully taken on substance and being within the material plane of Aon, yet even in its malformed state you recognize it to be a materialization of ultimate evil.

The freezing air seethes with tension as the presence of Naar triggers explosive chemical imbalances within it. Then, above the crackling cacophony of noise, you hear a chilling voice speaking to you in your native tongue.</p>
      <p>'Disciple of Kai - you know my name. Will you not deign to speak it?'</p>

      <p>'You may be one of Kai's favourite minions,' retorts the voice, 'but you will always be mortal. You would do well to remember that in my presence.' Thunder booms and the floor shakes beneath your feet, causing you to fall involuntarily to your knees.</p>
      <p>'Now that you bow before me, Lone Wolf, I shall impart to you your fate, for I am the true master of Aon. This is Avaros, a small and insignificant satellite of Duron, a world that has long been devoted to my cause. And you have been lured here for one purpose - to be destroyed. During the speck of time that you have existed, you have become an impertinent obstacle to my conquest of Magnamund. For this you will forfeit your soul. Yet, before I claim your worthless soul, I shall make sport of your demise so that Kai and Ishir shall see the worthlessness of their creations and know the futility of their cause.'</p>
      <p>Once more the thunder booms and you are blinded momentarily by a flash of white fire. Slowly your sight returns, and now you can see your adversary - Wolf's Bane - standing upon the plinth, directly under the menacing black cloud.</p>
      <p>'Here is my champion,' speaks the voice of Naar, 'you and he are well-matched for the contest that is about to commence.'</p>
      <p>Wolf's Bane unsheathes his sword and levels it your chest. His facial features twist into a grotesque parody of your own as he spits out a venomous threat:</p>
      <p>'Victory will be mine, Lone Wolf. Evil shall ultimately triumph!'</p>
      <p>You shout a defiant riposte, but the voice of Naar booms once more, drowning your worthy cry:</p>

      <p>Slowly you descend the stairs and approach the banqueting table. Wolf's Bane slides the open case towards you and motions for you to take a weapon. You reach for the box and remove the uppermost rapier, then you slide the case back across the table to your opponent.</p>

      <p>The Duel: Lone Wolf vs. Wolf's Bane</p>
      <p>The combat ratio for the duel is -4. This ratio takes account of all bonuses which may apply (eg Grand Weaponmastery with Sword, psychic attacks, and Special Items). Wolf's Bane's <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> score is identical to your current <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> score, unless you possess a Bronze Disc.

      <choice idref="sect151">Conduct the combat using the normal combat procedure. However, should Wolf's Bane's <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> be reduced to 10 or less, do not continue any further with the fight. Instead, <link-text>turn immediately to 151</link-text>.</choice>

      <p>You approach the hut and crouch down beside its mud wall, close to its open door. Your senses detect no glyphs or other traps here, and there are no residues of magical energy that might betray the presence of illusions or shielding spells. Wary of further delay, you approach the trench at the centre of the hut and descend a flight of steps that leads down to an underground tunnel. You still cannot detect any traps, yet you have gone only a few yards along this narrow passageway when you hear the terrifying roar of a large cat. With an abruptness that takes your breath away, a huge tiger-like beast comes bounding from out of the darkness ahead. So sudden and unexpected is this creature's attack, that you only just have time in which to unsheathe a hand-weapon as it hurls itself upon you.</p>

      <p>For two hours you observe the tower. During this time you sense that an invisible field of energy surrounds the wall, a defence that augments the terrifyingly deep moat. This force field disappears only when the portal opens and the drawbridge extends to allow for the arrival or departure of armoured warriors, or strange horseless wagons that hover a few feet from the ground, but in the main the great door remains firmly closed.</p>
      <p>You notice that the sparse traffic of warriors and wagons passes along one avenue. It is the only thoroughfare approaching the tower which has been cleared of debris. It is an uncomfortable vigil, but the time you spend observing the tower is rewarded when a bold plan gradually takes form in your mind.</p>
      <p>You assess that an entry to the tower could be effected by two means: if you were able to ambush a warrior and use his armour as a disguise, or, if you were able to stow away aboard one of the wagons approaching the moat.</p>

      <p>The moment you pass through the storm clouds, you enter a stratosphere that is bathed with magnificent light. Above the city's perpetual cloud layer lies a wondrous vista, an aerial realm that is calm and clear. The golden rays from two suns and the reflected light from twelve satellite moons, combine to bathe the thunderheads with a panoply of colour. You scan these heavens and see high above the dragonfly which is carrying Wolf's Bane. It is climbing towards a castle-like fortress that seems to rest upon a base of wispy cloud, defying gravity. Your enemy's flying mount enters the castle from below, passing through a gap in the underside of its cloudy base. Upon seeing his destination you urge your own winged mount to follow in his wake.</p>
      <p>You enter the clouds and pass through an open portal, like some massive trapdoor located in the belly of this mystical stronghold. Beyond the portal is a cavern of stone, vaulted and substantial like the dungeons of a great castle. There is no sign of your enemy, save for his mount which is tethered to a wooden pier. You bring your dragonfly in to land upon this pier and then leap down from its back and examine the ground for tracks. You find what you are seeking and they lead you to an archway that opens upon a landing where three tunnels lead off in different directions.

You bite your lip to stifle a scream of pain as you hit the warehouse floor, then you scramble for the nearest cover - a heavy iron chest, banded and riveted with steel - to avoid leaving yourself exposed to another blast from this deadly weapon. The warrior follows your swift move and discharges a second beam from his spear which slams into the iron chest with stunning force. You gasp with horror as you see the side of the chest bulging towards your face. Its thick rivets tremble and its age-blackened skin smoulders with a sullen heat. Instinct takes over, making you roll away from the iron chest and seek cover elsewhere. As you move, the beam of light tears through the rear of the iron box and destroys the ground where, only moments before, your face had been.</p>

      <p>'Follow me, my lords!' shouts Foilan, as he spurs his black mare along a narrow, cobblestoned street that wends its way through Tyso's shabby northern quarter. At a junction close by the city's main stables, he turns into an avenue that leads to the West Arch of the Old Necropolis.</p>
      <p>When the Arch is less than a hundred yards distant, Foilan brings his horse to a halt and you reign in your steed beside him. Several dozen guards and rangers have gathered at the Arch and they have erected a barricade which completely blocks the entrance to the burial ground beyond. The Reeve-lieutenant tells you to wait here with your men while he goes forward to inform the guards of the situation and to tell them that you and your companions are not Kai impostors.</p>
      <p>Patiently you wait for Foilan to complete his task. Then, on seeing his signal, you move forward and join him at the Western Arch. He shouts an order and hurriedly the guards pull aside a wagon which blocks the entrance, enabling the five of you to dismount and proceed into the necropolis on foot.</p>
      <p>Aided by the moonlight, you lead your party along a gravelled path towards the centre of the burial ground, to where a tunnel-like opening has been excavated in the side of a mossy mound. On arriving at this shadowy entrance you stop to examine the surrounding area, to check for any clues that may help you track your quarry. You find no fresh prints and you sense no lingering aura of an evil that could betray his presence. Confident that it is safe to proceed, you enter the mound and lead your comrades down a wide stone ramp to an oval-shaped chamber. A dozen stone coffins, each carved with the likeness of its occupant, are laid out in a circle like the spokes of a wheel. The chamber is cold and unwelcoming, but it does not harbour any trace of evil. You are sure that the impostor has not set foot here.</p>
      <p>On the far side of the burial chamber, opposite the ramp, there is a stairwell which descends deep into the catacombs below the necropolis. You go down these stairs until you come to a landing where a passage crosses from north to south. Black Hawk suggests that the party split in two and explore both ways, but you are not in favour of this idea. Splitting the party would make it easier for the impostor if he chose to launch an ambush. You peer along both passages and draw on your Grand Mastery skills to determine the best route to follow, but with little success. Neither passage looks especially inviting.</p>

      <p>You enter the building at ground level and follow your adversary's tracks to a mouldering hall at the rear of this derelict dwelling. From the cover of a shadowy alcove you watch as Wolf's Bane meets and converses with two warriors. They are both helmeted and clad in suits of close-fitting grey armour. They have shiny steel spears slung over their shoulders which radiate a faint hum of electrical power. Their meeting is brief. Wolf's Bane issues terse commands and the two warriors leave to enact his orders. As you watch them go, you hazard a guess that their mission is to find and kill you.</p>
      <p>Wolf's Bane leaves the hall by a broken rear door. You wait for a few minutes, to reduce the risk that he may detect how near you are, and then you follow his trail. The rear of the building opens onto a wasteland of shattered rubble which is bisected by a dead stream of salty, acidic water. You follow your opponent's trail across this bleak and forbidding landscape, past sharp spires of crimson and jet that erupt through the dereliction to scratch the cloudy sky. Rust-red water encircles their bases, lending them a wholly sinister aspect. To your eyes it seems as if this blighted city has been impaled upon these cruel, towering spikes.</p>
      <p>Beyond the spires you see Wolf's Bane descending a flight of stone steps that disappear into the ground. Suddenly he stops and looks in your direction; it is as if he has sensed you are on his trail. Instinctively you dive to take cover behind a broken wall, but as you hit the ground it collapses, dumping you unceremoniously into a cellar that is flooded with black, briney water.</p>
      <p>Coughing and spluttering, you bob to the surface and reach out to grab at a stone step. It is the lowest of a flight of slime-smeared steps that rise out of the water and ascend to a trapdoor in the ceiling. Suddenly you see two fiery red eyes emerging from the darkness and your stomach churns. They belong to the hungry, rubbery-skinned creature that dwells in this dismal cellar. It reaches out to grab you with its taloned hands, but you avoid its attack by wrenching at its wrist, sending it somersaulting over your head to splash into the water. Quickly you attempt to pull yourself onto the slippery steps before this creature recovers and tries to attack again.</p>

      <p>Before you lies a smoke-filled hall that reeks of death and decay. Only the floor appears to be solid, and yet when you stare down at its glassy surface, you see that it is honeycombed with thousands of cells, each one occupied by a tortured soul writhing in perpetual torment. The walls of this evil chamber are wreathed with sulphurous smoke, lit intermittently by shafts of crimson lightning. The foul substances which pass for air seethe with the tension of ferocious, evil energies.</p>
      <p>From the centre of the floor there arises a slender domed plinth. Moments later, a wide dais rises beside it, upon which you see a visage of the Dark God, one that he favours whilst occupying his unholy throne hall. Nothing could have prepared you for the sight that now meets your gaze - it is the foulest you have ever seen.</p>
      <p>Naar's favoured form is a great globular body, like that of a bloated spider, borne by a score of stunted limbs which emerge chaotically from the underside of a sac-like abdomen. His face hangs like a parody of a wrinkled old sow's yet with an evil-smelling black hole where one could expect a snout. The upper surface of his body is covered with pouches of vile fluids that trail wisps of black smoke, and his maw is studded with hundreds of blue-stained fangs. But it is the eyes that shock you most. The Dark God has the eyes of a man.</p>
      <p>Naar shifts his bloated body from the dais and slither-shuffles towards the plinth. A misshapen limb extends to the plinth and its domed cover retracts to reveal a wondrous and mysterious artifact. A second shock stuns your senses when you recognize the nature of this artifact. It is one of the most legendary items in all the long history of Magnamund. It is the fabled Moonstone of the Shianti!</p>

      <p>You have come to the edge of a deep canyon. The verdant walls of this massive gorge are carpeted with a rainbow of colour and the air is alive with the busy noise of huge, buzzing insects. Everything is fecund and fertile and dripping with humid jungle heat. High above the gorge you glimpse for the first time the source of the light which illuminates this strangely wonderful realm. The canyon is set within a cavern, the walls of which seem to engulf the sky. At its apex there is an oval-shaped vent through which a concentrated shower of amber rays pours down, like sunbeams through a stained glass portal. You watch in awe as flights of dragonflies, each as large as a Vassagonian Itikar, circle languidly above the canyon on gossamer wings. They shimmer like streaks of liquid silver as they ride the thermal currents. The sight is one of great beauty, yet one you cannot fully enjoy. The instinct which led you to the rim of this gorge now tells you that the source of the power you seek lies several miles away and above, beyond the vent that is the source of this cavern's light. Carefully you consider your predicament and determine that in order to escape, you must reach the vent - an exit that lies more than a thousand feet above the rim of the gorge.</p>

      <p>'This way, my lords!' shouts Foilan, as he spurs his black mare along a mist-wreathed street that snakes through Tyso's shabby northern quarter. The street is deserted yet many citizens witness your passing. Their eyes glint in the moonlight as they peep through the smoky yellow panes of their windows, their curiosity and fears awakened by the clatter of your horses' hooves.</p>
      <p>At length the street opens onto a wider avenue which gently descends towards a sprawling expanse of derelict ground surrounded by a tall, moss-covered perimeter wall. Several dozen guards and rangers have gathered at a distant archway in this wall and, by magnifying your vision, you can see that they have erected a barricade which completely blocks the entrance to the burial ground beyond.</p>
      <p>The Reeve-lieutenant tells you to wait here with your men. Then he goes forward to inform the guards of the situation and to tell them that you and your companions are not Kai impostors. On seeing his signal, you move forward and join him at the archway. At his command, the guards hurriedly clear away some of the rubble which fills the entrance, enabling the five of you to dismount and proceed into the necropolis on foot.</p>
      <p>In the moonlight, the burial ground has a certain ghostly beauty. There is an aura of sad serenity surrounding its mouldering tombs as, with the passing of centuries, they crumble to dust and disappear with their secret memories of another age. But all is not what it seems. Your sixth sense detects the lingering aura of an evil entity that has invaded this place. A glance at your fellow Kai tells you that they, too, can sense its presence.</p>
      <p>You clasp the Platinum Amulet and feel a tingling vibration run through the palm of your hand. The sensation grows stronger as you move along a weed-choked path which leads to a shadowy tomb. With the passage of the years this tomb has settled lop-sidedly into the soft Tysoan earth, yet a flight of damp stone steps descends to where its door once was. As you draw nearer, you notice that all that now remains of the door is a mound of broken rubble.</p>

You cast your hands over them and detect that this is not a false trail; your enemy passed this way sometime within the last hour.</p>
      <p>Slowly you ascend the stairs and arrive at the arched entrance to a large, vaulted stone chamber. Gathered around a fountain set into its north wall are a group of six grey-skinned humanoids. They are busy drinking a clear, oily fluid that pours from the fountain's spout into a semi-circular trough. All are barefoot and clad in rags, and they are each armed with a spear and a bow. The only exit from this chamber appears to be an archway set high in the north wall. There is a balcony in front of it that can only be reached by two flights of stairs which rise up on either side of the fountain.</p>
