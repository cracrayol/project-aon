     <p>You are Grand Master Lone Wolf, the sole survivor of a massacre that wiped out the First Order of the Kai<ch.emdash/>the warrior <ch.eacute/>lite of Sommerlund. It is the year MS 5081, thirty-one years since your brave kinsmen perished at the hands of the Darklords of Helgedad. These champions of evil, who were sent forth by Naar, the King of the Darkness, to destroy the fertile world of Magnamund have themselves since been destroyed. You vowed to avenge the murder of the Kai and you kept your pledge, for it was you who brought about their downfall when alone you infiltrated their foul domain<ch.emdash/>the Darklands<ch.emdash/>and destroyed the base of their power that was the infernal city of Helgedad. In the wake of their destruction, chaos befell the Darkland armies that had been poised to conquer all of Magnamund. Their disorder escalated into a mutinous civil war which allowed the free-state armies of Magnamund time in which to recover and launch a successful counter-offensive. Against the odds, a swift and total victory was secured over the feuding enemy armies.</p>

     <p>For more than ten years now, peace has reigned in Sommerlund. Under your direction the once-ruined Monastery of the Kai has been rebuilt and restored to its former glory, and the task of teaching a New Order of Kai warriors the skills and proud traditions of your ancestors has been re-established. The new generation of Kai recruits, all of whom were born during the era of war against the Darklords, possess strong latent Kai skills and all show exceptional promise. These skills will be nurtured and honed to perfection during their time at the monastery so that they may teach and inspire future generations, thereby ensuring the continued security of your homeland in future years.</p>

     <p>Your attainment of the rank of Kai Grand Master brought with it great rewards. Some, such as the restoration of the Kai and the undying gratitude of your fellow Sommlending, could have been anticipated. Yet there have also been rewards which you could not possibly have foreseen. The discovery that within you lay the potential to develop Kai Disciplines beyond those of the Magnakai (which were once thought to be the ultimate that a Kai Master could aspire to) was truly a revelation. This discovery has inspired you to search for the wisdom and power that no Kai Lord before you has ever possessed. In the name of your creator, the God Kai, and for the greater glory of Sommerlund and the Goddess Ishir, you have vowed to scale the very pinnacle of Kai perfection<ch.emdash/>to attain all of the Grand Master Disciplines and become the first Kai Supreme Master.</p>

     <p>With diligence and determination you set about the restoration of the Kai Monastery and the training of the New Order recruits. Your efforts were swiftly rewarded for within the space of two short years the first raw recruits had graduated to become a cadre of gifted Kai Masters who, in turn, were able to commence the teaching of their skills to subsequent intakes of Kai novices. Readily the Kai Masters rose to their newfound responsibilities, leaving you free to devote more of your time to the pursuit and perfection of the Grand Master Disciplines. During this period you also received expert tutelage in the ways of magic from two of your most-trusted friends and advisors: Guildmaster Banedon, leader of the Brotherhood of the Crystal Star, and Lord Rimoah, speaker for the High Council of the Elder Magi.</p>

     <p>In the deepest subterranean level of the monastery, one hundred feet below the Tower of the Sun, you ordered the excavation and construction of a special vault. In this magnificent chamber wrought of granite and gold you placed the Lorestones of Nyxator<ch.emdash/>seven gems of Kai power which you had recovered during an earlier quest for Kai knowledge. In this vault, bathed in the golden light of the radiant gems, you spent countless hours in pursuit of perfection. Sometimes alone, sometimes in the company of your two able advisors<ch.emdash/>Banedon and Rimoah<ch.emdash/>you worked hard to develop your innate Grand Master Disciplines and grasp the fundamental secrets of Brotherhood and Old Kingdom magic. During this time you noticed many remarkable changes taking place within your body: you became physically and mentally stronger, your five primary senses sharpened far beyond all that you had experienced before, and, perhaps most remarkably, your body began to age at a much slower rate. Now, for every five years that elapse you age but one year.</p>

     <p>In the years since your victory over the Darklords, peace has reigned victorious and the peoples of the Free Kingdoms have rejoiced in the knowledge that the evil which once threatened to destroy them has been banished from the face of Magnamund. Readily men have exchanged their swords for hoes and their shields for ploughs, and now the only marching they do is along the ruts of their freshly furrowed fields. Few are the watchful eyes that scan the distant horizon in fear of what may appear; although there are still some who maintain their vigilance, for the agents of the Dark God Naar come in many guises and there are those upon Magnamund who wait quietly in the shadows for the chance to do his evil bidding.</p>

     <p>Already your newfound skills have been tested against Naar<ch.apos/>s agents and you have, on each occasion, acquitted yourself admirably. Yet your continuing victories have enraged the Dark God and inflamed his lust for vengeance. From the depths of his stronghold upon the Plane of Darkness he created and sent to Sommerlund an evil champion called <quote>Wolf<ch.apos/>s Bane</quote> who was the very image of yourself. While you were engaged upon a quest overseas, this impostor terrorized your homeland and sought to destroy your reputation and the honour of the Kai. And he would have succeeded had it not been for your courage and determination. You returned home and pursued your enemy to an ancient necropolis in the city of Tyso. Here, in a deep subterranean crypt, you and your evil alter-ego were drawn through a Shadow Gate<ch.emdash/>an astral corridor which connects your home world of Magnamund to several other planes of existence. You both emerged upon the remote planet of Avaros where a deadly duel ensued. With the unexpected help of an enigmatic elemental called Alyss you vanquished your foe, but before you could find your way back to your home world, you and Alyss were both sucked through a second Shadow Gate which led to the Plane of Darkness<ch.emdash/>the fell domain of Naar himself.</p>

     <p>In the throne hall of Naar a titanic struggle took place as you and Alyss fought desperately to escape from the Dark God and his court of powerful minions. During this battle you discovered that Naar had in his possession the fabled Moonstone of the Shianti<ch.emdash/>a wondrous artefact created many thousands of years ago by the godlike Shianti, whose presence upon Magnamund had heralded the dawn of humanity. This stone of power contains the combined might of all their magic and wisdom, the sum of all their knowledge. So significant was the creation of this stone that all time on Magnamund is measured from the date of its creation. It had long been held that the Moonstone<ch.apos/>s location was a secret known only to the remnants of the Shianti, who dwell upon the Isle of Lorn in remotest Southern Magnamund, yet the evidence of your eyes told you that this mystical artefact had somehow fallen into the hands of the Dark God.</p>

     <p>Suddenly the significance of the Moonstone became crystal clear. Naar had been using its legendary powers to generate Shadow Gates within the world of Magnamund, at locations and times of his own choosing. Such power had enabled him to send his loathsome champions to your home world, while the goodly forces of Kai and Ishir had been held at bay, helpless to counter them. Only you and your Kai brethren have stood in the way of the onslaught of Naar<ch.apos/>s agents since the demise of the Darklords.</p>

     <p>During the battle, thanks to Alyss<ch.apos/>s selfless courage, you were able to escape from Naar<ch.apos/>s throne hall by leaping into the Shadow Gate. As you entered its whirling maw, the last image that burned itself into your memory was that of Alyss slowly succumbing to the relentless attacks of Naar<ch.apos/>s minions. Successfully you had defeated Wolf<ch.apos/>s Bane and thwarted Naar<ch.apos/>s sinister plan to destroy the honour of the Kai, but as you returned through the Shadow Gate to the land of your birth, you knew that the fight against Evil was not yet won. You realized that if you were to prevent the Dark God from sending more of his dread creations into Magnamund, you would have to return to the Plane of Darkness and retrieve the fabled Moonstone. Only by doing so would Magnamund truly be safe from the ravages of Naar<ch.apos/>s armies of darkness.</p>

      <p>The Discipline bonuses mentioned do not affect your permanent scores. If you have completed previous adventures, the Disciplines that you have mastered may still be beneficial. See the Grand Master Rules section of the <a href="&link.rh;">Readers<ch.apos/> Handbook</a> for details.</p>

    <data>
     <p>You keep a record of your adventure on the <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
     <p>For more than six years, ever since the demise of the Darklords of Helgedad, you have devoted yourself to developing further your fighting prowess<ch.emdash/><typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ><ch.emdash/>and physical stamina<ch.emdash/><typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ>. Before you begin your first Grand Master adventure you need to measure how effective your training has been. To do this take a pencil and, with your eyes closed, point with the blunt end of it on to the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a>. If you pick a 0 it counts as zero.</p>
     <p>The first number that you pick from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> in this way represents your <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ>. Add 25 to the number you picked and write the total in the <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> section of your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a> (i.e., if your pencil fell on the number 6 in the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> you would write in a <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> of 31). When you fight, your <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> will be pitted against that of your enemy. A high score in this section is therefore very desirable.</p>
     <p>The second number that you pick from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> represents your powers of <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ>. Add 30 to this number and write the total in the <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> section of your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a> (i.e., if your pencil fell on the number 7 on the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> you would have 37 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points).</p>
     <p>If you are wounded in combat you will lose <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points. If at any time your <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points fall to zero or below, you are dead and the adventure is over. Lost <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points can be regained during the course of the adventure, but your number of <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points can never rise above the number you have when you start an adventure.</p>
     <p>If you have successfully completed any of the previous adventures in the <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> series (Books 1<ch.endash/>19), you can carry your current scores of <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> and <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points over to Book 20. These scores may include Weaponmastery, Curing, and Psi-surge bonuses obtained upon completion of <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> Kai (Books 1<ch.endash/>5) or Magnakai (Books 6<ch.endash/>12) adventures.<footref id="gamerulz-1" idref="gamerulz-1-foot"/> Only if you have completed these previous adventures will you benefit from the appropriate bonuses in the course of the Grand Master series. You may also carry over any Weapons and Backpack Items you had in your possession at the end of your last adventure, and these should be entered on your new Grand Master <a idref="action">Action Chart</a> (you are still limited to two Weapons, but you may now carry up to ten Backpack Items).</p>
     <p>However, only the following Special Items may be carried over from the <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> Kai (Books 1<ch.endash/>5) and Magnakai (Books 6<ch.endash/>12) series to the <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> Grand Master series (Books 13<ch.endash/>onwards):</p>

       <p>Now, through the pursuit of new skills and the further development of your innate Kai abilities, you have set out upon a path of discovery that no other Kai Grand Master has ever attempted with success. Your determination to become the first Kai Supreme Master; by acquiring total proficiency in all twelve of the Grand Master Disciplines, is an awe-inspiring challenge. You will be venturing into the unknown, pushing back the boundaries of human limitation in the pursuit of greatness and the cause of Good. May the blessings of the Gods Kai and Ishir go with you on your brave and noble quest.</p>
       <p>In the years following the demise of the Darklords you have reached the rank of Kai Grand Defender, which means that you have mastered <em>four</em> of the Grand Master Disciplines listed below. It is up to you to choose which four Disciplines these are. As all of the Grand Master Disciplines will be of use to you at some point during your quest, pick your four skills with care. The correct use of a Grand Master Discipline at the right time could save your life. When you have chosen your four Disciplines, enter them in the Grand Master Disciplines section of your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>.</p>

         <p>When using their psychic ability to attack an enemy, Grand Masters may add 8 points to their <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ>. For every round in which Kai-surge is used, they need only deduct 1 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> point.

       <p>There will be occasions during your adventure when you will have to fight an enemy. The enemy<ch.apos/>s <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> and <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points are given in the text. Lone Wolf<ch.apos/>s aim in the combat is to kill the enemy by reducing his <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points to zero while losing as few <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points as possible himself.</p>
       <p>At the start of a combat, enter Lone Wolf<ch.apos/>s and the enemy<ch.apos/>s <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points in the appropriate boxes on the Combat Record section of your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
       <p>The sequence for combat is as follows:</p>
       <ol class="paragraphed">
        <li>
         <p>Add any extra points gained through your Grand Master Disciplines and Special Items to your current <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> total.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
         <p>Subtract the <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> of your enemy from this total. The result is your Combat Ratio. Enter it on the <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
         <p>Example</p>
         <p>Lone Wolf (<typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> 32) is attacked by a pack of Doomwolves (<typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> 30). He is taken by surprise and is not given the opportunity of evading their attack. Lone Wolf has the Grand Master Discipline of Kai-surge to which the Doomwolves are not immune, so Lone Wolf adds 8 points to his <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> giving him a total <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> of 40.</p>
         <p>He subtracts the Doomwolf pack<ch.apos/>s <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> from his own, giving a Combat Ratio of +10 (40<ch.minus/>30 = +10). +10 is noted on the <a idref="action">Action Chart</a> as the Combat Ratio.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
         <p><a id="stage3">When you have your Combat Ratio</a>, pick a number from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a>.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
         <p>Turn to the <a idref="crtable">Combat Results Table</a>. Along the top of the chart are shown the Combat Ratio numbers. Find the number that is the same as your Combat Ratio and cross-reference it with the random number that you have picked (the random numbers appear on the side of the chart). You now have the number of <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points lost by both Lone Wolf and his enemy in this round of combat. (E represents points lost by the enemy; LW represents points lost by Lone Wolf.)</p>
         <p>Example</p>
         <p>The Combat Ratio between Lone Wolf and the Doomwolf Pack has been established as +10. If the number taken from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> is a 2, then the result of the first round of combat:</p>
         <ul>
          <li>Lone Wolf loses 3 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points (plus an additional 1 point for using Kai-surge. This loss is in addition to the loss suffered as a result of combat)</li>
          <li>Doomwolf Pack loses 9 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points.</li>
         </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
         <p>On the <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>, mark the changes in <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points to the participants in the combat.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
         <p>Unless otherwise instructed, or unless you have an option to evade, the next round of combat now starts.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
         <p>Repeat the sequence from <a idref="stage3">Stage 3</a>.</p>
        </li>
       </ol>

       <p>This process of combat continues until the <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points of either the enemy or Lone Wolf are reduced to zero or below, at which point that combatant is declared dead. If Lone Wolf is dead, the adventure is over. If the enemy is dead, Lone Wolf proceeds but with his <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points possibly reduced.</p>

All points lost by the enemy as a result of that round are ignored, and you make your escape. Only Lone Wolf may lose <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points during that round (but then that is the risk of running away!).

           <dd><p>Sun Lords with this Discipline are able to cause the metal edge of any non-magical weapon to ignite and burn fiercely. When a weapon thus affected is used in combat, it inflicts an additional 1 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> point loss upon an enemy in every successful round of combat. This ability cannot be used with a wholly wooden weapon such as a quarterstaff.</p></dd>
          <dt>Assimilance</dt>
           <dd><p>Sun Lords who possess this skill are able to cause the outline of their bodies to become blurred and indistinct. By so doing, they can greatly increase their chances of avoiding magical and/or non-magical missiles directed at them.</p></dd>

They can also see light in the ultraviolet spectrum.</p></dd>
          <dt>Kai-surge</dt>
           <dd><p>Sun Lords who possess mastery of this Discipline are able to launch a Kai-blast<ch.emdash/>a pulse of intense psychic energy which is capable of affecting both psychically active and inactive enemies. This form of psychic attack is very effective, more so than a usual Kai-surge, Psi-surge or Mindblast. It can cause an enemy to lose between 2 and 18 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points in one attack. A Kai Sun Lord using Kai-blast determines the damage inflicted on an enemy by picking two numbers from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a>. These numbers should be added together (a <quote>0</quote> = 1) and the resultant total equals the damage inflicted. However, use of a Kai-blast will reduce a Sun Lord<ch.apos/>s <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points total by 4. It cannot be used in conjunction with any other form of psychic attack.</p></dd>

It is similar in effect to the <!--ERRTAG-RE-58099-->Brotherhood Spell <spell>Lightning Hand</spell><!--/ERRTAG-RE-58099-->, but differs in that it is easier to control and channel the resulting energy.

          <dt>Grand Nexus</dt>
           <dd><p>Grand Thanes who possess mastery of this Discipline can pass freely through Shadow Gates. These phenomena are special portals which enable one to access other dimensions and planes of existence outside of Magnamund. Kai Grand Thanes are able to detect the location of Shadow Gates and pass through them without suffering any physical ill effects.

          <dt>Grand Weaponmastery</dt>
           <dd><p>Kai Grand Crowns with this discipline are consummate masters of unarmed combat. When fighting bare-handed, i.e. without any weapons, they may add 3 points to their <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ>.</p></dd>
          <dt>Animal Mastery</dt>
           <dd><p>Grand Crowns with this ability are able to plant in the mind of any animal the image of their most feared predator or adversary. Under the influence of this illusion the animal will believe, with all of its senses, that it is being confronted by such a creature instead of a Kai Grand Crown.</p></dd>
          <dt>Grand Pathsmanship</dt>
           <dd><p>Grand Crowns with this skill are able to create a clear passageway through dense undergrowth, forest, or jungle. Once having passed through this passageway, the plant material will revert to its normal state. This skill can also be employed by a Kai Grand Crown against magical foliage, or to counter any plant material ranged against him by an enemy.</p></dd>
          <dt>Kai-screen</dt>
           <dd><p>Grand Crowns who possess mastery of this Discipline are able to mask the goodly aura which radiates naturally from their minds and bodies. Additionally, Grand Crowns can deliberately alter these auras to give a false impression of themselves to creatures who are sensitive to such psychic auras.</p></dd>
          <dt>Grand Nexus</dt>
           <dd><p>Grand Crowns who possess this Discipline are able to speak a Kai Power Word<ch.emdash/>a holy utterance which will cause physical and psychic damage to any single creature within a radius of thirty feet. The degree of damage so caused, and the resultant drain upon a Grand Crown<ch.apos/>s reserves of <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ>, are dependent upon individual circumstances.

The spell will carry the caster, his equipment, and clothing to his chosen sighted destination. It cannot be used on any other living creature and it will not transport any other living creature along with the caster. Use of this spell will cost the caster between 1 and 5 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points every time it is used. This cost reduces as a Kai Grand Master increases in rank.</li>

           <dd><p>Kai Sun Princes with this Discipline are able to alter their appearance, including clothing and equipment, to take on the guise of any animal that they may come into contact with. This physical change will only be witnessed by the animal in question.</p></dd>
          <dt>Deliverance</dt>
           <dd><p>Sun Princes with this ability are able to cause the regeneration of lost body parts, i.e. hands, feet, arms, legs, eyes and internal organs. This improved Discipline can be used to repair a Sun Prince<ch.apos/>s own body, or that of another person or creature. The time required to effect regeneration depends on the size and relative importance of the body part affected.</p></dd>
          <dt>Assimilance</dt>
           <dd><p>Kai Sun Princes who possess this Discipline are able to create an illusory double of themselves and project this image up to a range of thirty feet. The Sun Prince must remain in visual contact with his/her image in order to maintain the illusion. Physical, magical, and psychic attacks upon the illusory image will cause no injury. The range of this ability increases substantially when a Sun Prince attains the rank of Kai Supreme Master.</p></dd>
          <dt>Kai-surge</dt>
           <dd><p>Sun Princes who possess mastery of this Discipline are able to focus their psychic power into a Kai-ray: a laser-like beam of mental energy capable of penetrating the strongest of psychic defences. This ability can be used once during a combat to reduce an enemy<ch.apos/>s <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> score by 15 points. However, use of this Kai-ray will also reduce a Sun Prince<ch.apos/>s <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> score by 4 points. It cannot be used if a Sun Prince<ch.apos/>s <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> score is 10 or less and it cannot be used in conjunction with any other form of psychic attack.</p></dd>

Creation of this sanctuary does not require thought or concentration; it occurs instantly whenever a Kai Sun Prince is subjected to psychic attack. The defensive strength of this sanctuary further increases when a Sun Prince attains the rank of Kai Supreme Master.</p></dd>
          <dt>Grand Huntmastery</dt>
           <dd><p>Grand Masters who have reached the rank of Sun Prince are able to control their direction and rate of movement when subjected to strong currents of air or water, or when venturing through non-material planes of existence, e.g. Shadow Gates.</p></dd>

        <p>Your journey through the Shadow Gate is a cold and lonely voyage, yet one that you endure without fear for you sense that Alyss is watching over you. She is using her powers to steer you safely home to Magnamund. As you hurtle through the timeless void, you remember vividly the last few moments which preceded your leap into the Shadow Gate and your triumphant escape from Naar<ch.apos/>s throne hall<ch.emdash/>the innermost sanctum of his stronghold upon the Plane of Darkness. You recall how Alyss commanded you to flee whilst she drew away the frenzied attacks of Naar<ch.apos/>s champion<ch.emdash/>Kekataag the Avenger. It was her selfless act of bravery which enabled you to escape and it has left an indelible mark upon your conscience. Inspired by her courage, and by the realization that if the Dark God is to be stopped from sending more of his foul creations to Magnamund you must deny him the fabled Moonstone of the Shianti, you vow that you will return to the Plane of Darkness and recapture that precious stone of power.</p>
        <p>After what seems like an eternity, gradually the inky blackness of the abyss is illuminated by a fluorescent vapour studded with whirling motes of light. Clumps of tiny stars swirl around your body like swarms of glowing moths until you become completely cocooned within a shroud of blinding white luminescence. Then, quite suddenly, you feel solid ground once more beneath your feet and you emerge from the light to find yourself standing in a dank, subterranean vault.</p>

Crouching here, as you listen fearfully to the hiss of flying missiles and the screams of the approaching horde, you notice the waters of the strange pool which lies no more than a dozen yards from the throne. Beyond this pool you see the pair of huge black gates which dominate the far wall of this chamber and suddenly you recall the text which appeared in the Tome of Darkness. This must be the Pool of Sorrows, and beyond it are the Gates of Darkness<ch.emdash/>an exit from this cruel domain. Your feelings of excitement at having discovered a way to escape the approaching horde are tempered when you further recall that you must spill your own blood into the pool if you are to leave this realm successfully. Without hesitation, you stab a finger against the point of your belt buckle and draw a few droplets of blood. Then you spring to your feet and rush towards the pool. As you come to within a few yards, you flick your finger and a stunning transformation takes place the instant your blood hits the pool<ch.apos/>s swirling surface.</p>

Pulses of psychic energy bombard your mind, making you shudder and recoil as your innate mind defences scramble to shield your psyche: lose 3 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points.</p>

        <p>As you listen to the rumbling sound drawing closer, you notice markings in the grit and dust which blankets the ground. You count wheel prints that have been made by several heavy wagons, and there are also innumerable rippled tracks that you cannot readily identify. The only markings you have experienced which bear any resemblance to these tracks were much smaller and were made by a centipede.</p>
        <p>The curious tracks have diverted your attention from the approaching noise. You glance along the tunnel and see a dark shape speeding through the gloom. Its width almost completely fills the tunnel.</p>

Through a gap in their tortured branches you can see a clearing at the centre of this copse and, when you magnify your vision, you glimpse part of a crude stone hut.

        <p>You stride towards Nza<ch.apos/>pok and raise your weapon, grimly determined to rid the universe of this foul creature.</p>
        <p><quote>So perish all spawn of evil,</quote> you cry, and, with one swift and mighty blow, you sunder his ghastly body in two. From the torn halves of his carcass there is an eruption of putrid gas that makes you reel backwards and cover your mouth and nose. Rapidly this gas dissipates and, in a matter of seconds, the remains of Nza<ch.apos/>pok and his amulet have turned to dust.</p>
        <p>A collective cry of horror arises from the distant horde the moment you slay their master. Fearing that the destruction of their leader will spur them to seek revenge, you hurry away along a track that winds through the settlement of huts and down to a beach covered with coarse black sand. Here a ramshackle jetty, constructed from wood and bone, protrudes from the lee of a sand dune and out into the sluggish grey sea. Fringing the beach is dense jungle from where there suddenly arises a cacophany of hellish cries, echoing those of the chaos-horde. You glimpse shadows moving in the undergrowth and when you stop momentarily to take a longer look, several arrows come shooting out of the trees. They arc towards you and explode when they hit the sand close by. Your Kai senses warn you that there are a great number of archers lurking in the jungle, far more than you can hope to defeat single-handedly. Anxious to escape while you are still able, you hurry down the beach to the jetty where you discover a sea-going canoe. Without daring to look back, you leap into this canoe, cast off its mooring rope, and paddle as fast as you can away from the shore.</p>
        <p>Once you feel sure that you are beyond arrow range, you attempt to follow the coastline in the hope of finding a safer place to put ashore. But a mist sweeps in across the water and engulfs your tiny craft before you can change course. This mist thickens rapidly to become a dense sea fog, the like of which you have never experienced. Despite your advanced Kai skills, you are unable to see through it and you quickly lose all sense of time and direction.</p>
        <p>After what seems like many hours, you eventually catch sight of a dark shape low in the water which, at first, appears to be a distant island. You paddle towards it but as you draw closer your senses suddenly scream a warning that you are heading into deadly danger. Instantly you reverse your stroke to change course, but it is already too late. Two slits open in the dark shape and a ghostly light washes over the fog-wreathed ocean. You feel the canoe lurch violently as it is hit by a powerful undercurrent and, in the next terrifying instant, you are sucked into the maw of a titanic subterranean sea creature and swallowed whole.</p>
        <p>Tragically, your life and your quest for the Moonstone come to a watery end here.</p>

        <p>To your relief you sense that your precautions have worked; the dragon no longer suspects that it is carrying a stowaway. It raises its head and continues its flight towards the construction area which lies close to the main temple. Upon reaching this busy area it hovers above an expanse of levelled ground which is covered with dozens of cargo nets full of blocks awaiting collection by the building teams. A crew of four reptillians guide your net gently to the ground and then swiftly they unhook it from the dragon<ch.apos/>s harness using long poles.</p>

        <p>For countless hours you follow this tunnel as it ascends and descends by ramps and stairways through a bewildering maze of chambers, vaults, and grand halls. On your travels through this vast underworld you witness many awe-inspiring sights: huge subterranean quarries, blazing furnaces, armouries, weapon forges, steel mills, and white-hot lava pits. Armies of grey-skinned humanoid workers labour without rest within this hellish domain to manufacture weapons of war and destruction.</p>
        <p>At one vast hall you stop to observe a legion of these creatures tapping the volcanic power which lies at the core of this realm. By a system of chutes and tubes they divert a blazing lava flow to turn gigantic wheels and heat titanic vats of noxious fluids. The workers, although physically similar in size and demeanour to Drakkarim, seem to lack consciousness and remain oblivious to your presence. It is as if they have been turned into unthinking automatons, programmed simply to perform their labour with little regard to their immediate surroundings.</p>
        <p>You leave the hall and ascend a staircase which spirals hundreds of feet through solid rock to a titanic concourse. Here your senses detect a living presence and you allow your Kai instincts to lead you in pursuit of it. You enter a tunnel which branches away from the concourse and follow this to a wider passage. The walls of this passage are decorated with spectacular scenes of war and destruction. Thousands of troops fight an endless parade of battles across the landscapes of a hundred different worlds. In each of the scenes the theme and the outcome is identical<ch.emdash/>the victory of the superior forces of Evil over the inferior armies of Good. This callous celebration of evil military might infuriates you, but you control your anger and use it to sharpen your senses. You detect that somewhere at the end of this passage is where the living presence can be found and, not knowing the nature of what it is that you will find there, you approach with the utmost caution.</p>
        <p>The passage ends at a vast chasm where a narrow bridge of rock crosses a yawning void to a gate located on the far side, some 300 yards distant. The gate and its surroundings have been fashioned to resemble the mouth and head of a ferocious dragon, and the bridge of rock is likewise carved to resemble its extended tongue. A shimmering, twinkling, blue-white light gleams from the mouth of the dragon-gate, revealing it to be the exit from this dark domain. Excited by your discovery, you step onto the narrow rock-bridge and make your way across to the far side as swiftly as you dare. On either side of this stone beam the chasm falls away into a seemingly bottomless pit. You try not to look down for the sight makes your stomach churn uncontrollably.</p>

He glances at your swordbelt and smiles when he sees the finely-crafted hilt of the Sommerswerd protruding from your scabbard.</p>
        <p><quote>Well, I see you<ch.apos/>ll have no need of new weaponry, Grand Master. Surely there can be no blade better suited to the slaying of the Dark God<ch.apos/>s foul creatures than the one you already possess<ch.emdash/>the Sword of the Sun.</quote></p>
        <p><quote>Aye,</quote> comments Ardan, <quote>tis true. Your divine sword can vanquish any of Naar<ch.apos/>s creations. It may even possess power enough to smite the Dark God himself!</quote></p>
        <p>Lord Ardan<ch.apos/>s words lift your spirits. It is comforting to hear that you possess at least one effective weapon against the horrors you may have to face during your quest for the Moonstone.</p>
        <p><quote>It is a fine blade, Grand Master,</quote> says Rimoah, <quote>but be sure to use it with utmost discretion. It was crafted upon the Plane of Light and it radiates a strong and goodly aura. In Naar<ch.apos/>s domain its radiant energies could attract unwanted attention.</quote></p>

        <p>You retrieve the book from your backpack and thumb through its shiny blank pages until you discover two pages that have changed both in colour and texture. A cluster of rust-red lettering is enclosed within the black runic borders that outline these two sheets of creamy parchment. Once again, using your Magnakai Discipline of pathsmanship, you study the complex text and are able to decipher much of its meaning.</p>
        <p>The words tell of Zantaz<ch.emdash/>the Lord of the Pit<ch.emdash/>whose many accompanying titles include Reaper of Gloom, Armourer of the Fell Legions, and Guardian of the Gate of Dragonflame. It says that he presides over a <quote>deep realm of rock, iron, steel and flame</quote>, and that among the many eternal duties he has been set by Naar, his primary task is to forge weapons of power for the Dark God<ch.apos/>s champions. Zantaz has no secret name, but you are able to translate the text which details how one can leave his domain. It makes for uneasy reading. The tome states that any who wish to depart must first <quote>defeat Zantaz in mortal combat and cast his body into the Pit of Darkflame, from whence he shall be reborn.</quote> Only by proving oneself worthy in combat against Zantaz can one cause <quote>the Gate of Dragonflame to release the worthy victor.</quote> The name <quote>Zantaz</quote> is vaguely familiar; you are sure that you have heard it before. As you ponder the remaining text which lists his infamous deeds, you suddenly recall where it was that you heard his name spoken. It was many years ago, while you were still an initiate at the Kai monastery, and your old tutor<ch.emdash/>Storm Hawk<ch.emdash/>was lecturing your class about the Drakkarim: the barbarian race of humanoids whose conquest of Northern Magnamund preceded the rise of the Darklords of Helgedad. Zantaz was the name of the warrior-god whom the Drakkarim worshipped.</p>
        <p>Feeling a little unnerved by what you have discovered and remembered, you close the tome and slip it back into your pack. You sense that the Moonstone is not to be found here in this domain of tunnels and so you resolve to escape from here as soon as possible. But if you are to do so successfully it seems you will first have to find and defeat Zantaz, the warrior-god of the Drakkarim.</p>
        <p>You get to your feet and continue along the tunnel which leads out of the empty cavern. You follow this passageway for several hundred yards until you arrive at a junction where another tunnel crosses your path from right to left. Cautiously you scan the tunnel in both directions and notice that away to your right, little more than twenty yards distant, is an open archway. Although you can sense no living presence, the angle of view and the darkness of the interior prevent you from determining what lies beyond this archway. To your left, your tracking skills reveal that the tunnel leads eventually to a dead end.</p>

Your Platinum Amulet protects you from the fierce conflagration, and it also feeds you with a steady warming stream of energy which radiates from the centre of your body outwards to soothe your aching limbs.</p>
        <p>Pick a number from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> (0<ch.endash/>10). Now double the number you have picked. This total equals the number of <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points you may restore as a result of the healing effects of the Platinum Amulet (remember your <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> score cannot exceed the total with which you began this adventure).</p>
        <p>After a short time the swirling corridor of flame gradually darkens and you feel the speed of your fall begin to decrease. Then, in a breathtaking instant, your feet slam into hot cindery ground and you crash forwards to land in a tangled heap.</p>

        <p>Ardan and Rimoah are honoured that you have chosen to take this sword which they have spent many months creating. (Record this sword<ch.emdash/><quote>Skarn-Ska</quote><ch.emdash/>on your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a> as a Special Item. When used in combat it will add 5 points to your <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ>. This sword possesses other attributes which will be revealed when it is used in combat.)</p>
        <p>You take hold of Skarn-Ska and essay a few strokes in the air to gauge its weight and balance. It does not take you too long to discover that this is an exceptionally fine blade. You feel your spirits rise, for now you possess at least one effective weapon against the horrors that may be encountered on your quest for the Moonstone.</p>
        <p><quote>We are delighted that you approve of Skarn-Ska, Grand Master,</quote> says Rimoah, <quote>but you must be sure to use it with discretion. It has magical properties which give off a strong and goodly aura. In Naar<ch.apos/>s domain these radiant energies could attract the unwanted attentions of those who dwell therein.</quote></p>
        <p>Lord Ardan picks up a seemingly plain leather scabbard from the table and offers it to you.</p>
        <p><quote>Here, Grand Master. I urge that you sheathe Skarn-Ska with this. It is woven from strands of pure korlinium and it will keep hidden the blade<ch.apos/>s true power from Naar<ch.apos/>s foul spawn.</quote></p>
        <p>You accept the scabbard from Ardan and affix it to your belt. (Record this Korlinium Scabbard on your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a> as a Special Item.)</p>
        <p><quote>The scabbard will shield your blade, Grand Master,</quote> comments Lord Rimoah, <quote>but what of yourself? You are imbued with Kai powers that may readily be detected.

        <p>You reach to your throat, unbutton the collar of your Kai robes, and withdraw the platinum amulet by its braided cord.</p>
        <p><quote>Ah, I see that you already possess a sigil of power,</quote> says Lord Rimoah, approvingly. <quote>It seems you are better prepared for the quest than we had anticipated.</quote></p>
        <p>With a nod of his head he motions to Lord Ardan who then retrieves an almost identical amulet from among the items on the table. Ardan gives the amulet to Rimoah and he slips it into his pocket.</p>

        <p>Once again Rimoah motions to Ardan and the elderly wizard responds by taking up a small package that is wrapped in a silk handkerchief. Carefully he unfolds the patterned silk square to reveal a book which is bound in jet-black hide. A wave of nausea makes you swallow hard as your natural Kai instincts detect that the origins of this book are wholly evil. Ardan offers it to you and, reluctantly, you take it from him.</p>
        <p><quote>It was discovered a decade ago in Northern Dessi,</quote> says Ardan. <quote>A party of our brethren found it on the Isle of Khor. It was buried in the ruins of Kazan-Oud.</quote></p>
        <p>Carefully you open the stiff black cover and, to your surprise, you discover that the inner pages comprise several sheets of pliable metal. They have the feel of parchment but they sparkle and glimmer like plates of polished steel. You turn through the pages and note that every one appears to be empty, devoid of script, pictures or diagrams of any sort.</p>
        <p><quote>I do not see how this book will help my quest,</quote> you say, as you flick back and forth through the seemingly empty pages.</p>
        <p><quote>This may be true while you are here in Sommerlund,</quote> replies Lord Rimoah, <quote>but once you arrive upon the Plane of Darkness I suspect that its secrets will be revealed. We of the High Council believe it contains information about the many realms and territories within Naar<ch.apos/>s domain. It may help guide you to the location of his throne hall and, with luck, to the Moonstone of the Shianti.</quote></p>
        <p>You are dubious as to the true value of this item but, in deference to Lord Rimoah<ch.apos/>s judgement, you agree to take it. (Record this Tome of Darkness on your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a> as a Special Item which you keep in your backpack.

        <p>The Demoness and her minions sense that they have wounded you and they howl with undisguised glee. But this sudden lull in the psychic combat allows you precious seconds in which to recover and strengthen your damaged mental defences. When they cease their cawing and launch their second attack, your defensive protections prove strong enough to deflect all of the combined psychic energies that are ranged against you, and the power of their attack rebounds upon them with devastating effect. The Lieutenants of Night fall screaming to the floor where they writhe in agony like wounded snakes. The Demoness reels and totters backwards, slumps down heavily upon her throne, and then grips her disfigured head in both hands as she struggles in vain to regain control of her disrupted mind.</p>
        <p>Seizing your advantage, you unsheathe your weapon and rush forward. With two swift and deadly blows you dispatch the lieutenants in passing and then rush towards Shamath<ch.apos/>s gigantic throne. Through the red haze of the agony that fills her head, the Demoness sees you approaching. Immediately she slams her right hand down upon the arm of her throne, to where a glowing opal is set into the stone.</p>
        <p><quote>Gnekasha!</quote> you scream, giving voice to her secret name, and she freezes as still as a stone statue. But not before her clenched fist has struck the glowing gem.</p>

With dread you glance over your shoulder and look to the source of the cacophony the chamber of tunnels beyond the archway of the Throne Room. What you see there sends an icy cold shiver of fear coursing down your spine.</p>

A river snakes through this dense foliage, winding its way towards a coastline on the horizon. As you approach the distant sea, the river becomes wider and flows into a delta. Your captors follow the river and begin a slow descent to an islet on the eastern side of the delta, towards an area near its seaward shore where the jungle has been hacked down to make room for a primitive settlement.</p>

In the middle of these huts there is an expanse of cleared ground and a large circular pit. The shrieks of the fliers draws an expectant crowd, a score of creatures of two distinctly different species. From the air they resemble gigantic ants and deformed, pale-skinned humanoids.</p>

        <p>The causeway comprises a procession of cracked grey blocks of stone which cross this fetid land and trail away towards a tangle of jungle vegetation that stretches across the horizon. In places the mouldering pavement disappears completely beneath the surface, swallowed by the swamp, yet the encroaching mud is shallow and it does not hamper your progress too greatly. On either side of this swamp-road you notice an occasional spur of rock protruding through the mire. Then you see the apex of a stone roof and a broken spire and suddenly you realize that they are segments of buildings. They are all that remain visible of an ancient city which has long since drowned beneath the swamp. The causeway is not a road at all; it is the remnants of the city<ch.apos/>s fortified wall.</p>
        <p>The cloudy green sky begins to darken and you sense a storm approaching. Minutes later, a gentle rain begins to fall which turns the surface of the swamp a milky shade of blue. You raise the hood of your cloak and press on, but suddenly you notice that your clothes are giving off wisps of smoke where they have been spattered by the rain. The rain is not water<ch.emdash/>it is a corrosive acid. Your Magnakai Discipline of Nexus protects your flesh from the effects of this acidic rain, but your clothing and equipment are vulnerable to its effect. Rather than risk losing them, you look around for some place to shelter from the coming storm. The only cover that you are able to discern is a large mound of fallen stone slabs several hundred yards away to your right.</p>

You watch the lavas moving away and then, under cover of the mist, you sprint from the dais towards an open archway at the base of the tower.

This must be the Pool of Sorrows, and beyond it are the Gates of Darkness<ch.emdash/>an exit from this cruel domain. Your feelings of excitement at having discovered a way to escape the approaching horde are tempered when you further recall that you must spill your own blood into the pool if you are to leave this realm successfully.

        <p>This gloomy cavern looks chillingly familiar, and when suddenly you recognize its derelict features a sense of fear and loathing pervades your mind. It was here you first encountered the Demoness Shamath with her army of attendants and dread automatons. You shudder when you recall how you seized the evil Deathstaff from this place, escaped from here by way of a Shadow Gate, and later thwarted Shamath<ch.apos/>s attempt to resurrect Darklord Vashna from the depths of the Maakengorge. The chamber<ch.apos/>s cracked and crumbling walls seem to reaffirm your past victory over the Demoness for you can detect no trace of the Shadow Gate nor of the supernatural creatures who previously dwelt in this once-splendid chamber. Cautiously you step out of the transporter beam and enter the cavern. The shattered remnants of the crystal dais crunch underfoot as you make your way across the floor towards a tunnel which gradually descends for more than a mile before reaching a circular cavern. The mouths of several smaller tunnels meet at this chamber, and all of these entrances are dark, save for one which radiates an icy blue luminescence. Before approaching any closer, you retrieve the Tome of Darkness from your backpack and consult its pages.</p>
        <p>The black page that revealed to you information about the realm of Huan<ch.apos/>zhor is now featureless, but the one which follows it has transformed; it has taken on the appearance of a thin sheet of ice. Sandwiched within its transparent layers are lines of blood-red writing interposed with intricate diagrams and astrological charts. Relying once more upon your Magnakai Discipline of pathsmanship, you are able to decipher much of this sorcerous text. The writings confirm some of what you already know, and they also provide you with fresh information that may aid your quest. You have entered the realm of the Demoness Shamath<ch.emdash/>the Mistress of the Gates of Darkness. The tome does not tell of her defeat by your hand, but you assume that this is because it was written long before your recent victory over her and her minions. Speaking as if she were still in control here, it says that she rules this domain from her throne of power which stands beside the Pool of Sorrows. You pass over the long list of unspeakably cruel deeds which earned her the right to rule this icy realm, and the revelation of her secret name<ch.emdash/><quote>Gnekasha</quote>, until you discover that which interests you most: details of how to escape from this realm. You swallow hard when you read that all those who would seek to leave the realm of Shamath must first <quote>spill their own blood in the Pool of Sorrows</quote>.</p>
        <p>You close the tome and stow it away into your backpack, then stealthily you approach the tunnel entrance which is radiating a pale azure light. When you halt upon its threshold and peer through its embellished archway, you witness a scene which both shocks and confounds you.</p>

        <p>The text tells of a creature called Huan<ch.apos/>zhor the Dragonlord, and of his throne of power which is located within <quote>a nest of fire atop the Tree of the Wyrm</quote>. It lists the many acts of Evil perpetrated by Huan<ch.apos/>zhor during his long existence, for which he has been generously rewarded by Naar; the Dark God has granted him this fiery domain within the Plane of Darkness. It continues at length to describe the creatures who are enslaved to him, which include the Lavas, the Zarthryn, and the Chugotha. But most interestingly it reveals his secret name<ch.emdash/><quote>Zheva</quote><ch.emdash/>which can be used to bind him, and tells of a magical item<ch.emdash/>the Scarab of the Wingless Dragon<ch.emdash/>which can be found in the <quote>nest of fire</quote> and which can be used to effect an escape from his realm.</p>
        <p>You close the tome and slip it back into your pack. From your makeshift shelter you command a view over the surrounding landscape in which there is nothing that remotely resembles a nest or a tree. All you are able to discern with any clarity is the blazing firestorm which is now sweeping across this charred land. Fearful of what could befall you when the firestorm reaches this exposed flank of the crater, you continue your climb and seek cover within the crater itself.</p>

        <p>Even though you decline to accept the sword which Rimoah and Ardan have painstakingly crafted, they show no disappointment. They accept your decision without comment or question. Rimoah returns the blade to the table and takes up a sigil of platinum which is strung upon a loop of braided cord.</p>
        <p><quote>Grand Master will you accept this amulet? It possesses powers which may help you survive the challenge of your coming ordeal.</quote></p>
        <p><quote>Very well,</quote> you reply, and take the amulet from your advisor<ch.apos/>s outstretched palm. (Record this Platinum Amulet, which you wear around your neck, as a Special Item on your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>. You need not discard another Special Item in its favour if you already hold the maximum number permissible.)</p>
        <p>As you tuck the amulet inside the collar of your robes, Lord Ardan picks up a small package from the table that is wrapped in a silk handkerchief. Carefully he unfolds the patterned silk square to reveal a book which is bound in jet-black hide. A wave of nausea makes you swallow hard as your natural Kai instincts detect that the origins of this book are wholly evil. Ardan offers it to you and, reluctantly this time, you take it from him.</p>
        <p><quote>It was discovered a decade ago in Northern Dessi,</quote> he says. <quote>A party of our brethren found it on the Isle of Khor. It was found buried in the ruins of Kazan-Oud.</quote></p>
        <p>Carefully you open the stiff black cover and, to your surprise, you discover that the inner pages comprise several sheets of pliable metal. They have the feel of parchment but they sparkle and glimmer like plates of polished steel. You turn through the pages and note that every one appears to be empty<ch.emdash/>devoid of script, pictures or diagrams of any sort.</p>
        <p><quote>I do not see how this book will help my quest,</quote> you say, as you flick back and forth through the seemingly empty pages.</p>
        <p><quote>This may be true while you are here in Sommerlund,</quote> replies Lord Rimoah, <quote>but once you arrive upon the Plane of Darkness I suspect that its secrets will be revealed. We of the High Council believe it contains information about the many realms and territories within Naar<ch.apos/>s domain. It may help guide you to the location of his throne hall and, with luck, to the Moonstone of the Shianti.</quote></p>
        <p>You are dubious as to the true value of this item but, in deference to Lord Rimoah<ch.apos/>s judgement, you agree to take it.

        <p>Gradually the distant speck grows larger until, with a sudden violent surge, you pass through its white-hot core and feel yourself engulfed by a damp and fetid atmosphere. Moments later your journey ends abruptly when you splash feet-first into a swampy morass. Despite the speed of your impact, your natural balance and agility prevents you from plunging beneath the surface of the stinking swamp into which you have fallen.</p>
        <p>After wiping away the slime that has splashed your face, you cast your gaze out across an unlovely vista of steaming mud pools fringed with dark jungle vegetation. A cloying aura of evil permeates every part of this vile landscape, leaving you in no doubt that you have successfully arrived at your destination<ch.emdash/>the Plane of Darkness. You look up and scour the corpse-green skies, but dense clouds of acidic vapour hide all traces of the Shadow Gate through which you have entered this plane. Feeling suddenly vulnerable standing waistdeep in steaming swamp mud, you decide to wade through the gluey sludge towards a nearby mound of barren grey earth. Once out of the mire, you rest on your haunches and consult the Tome of Darkness given to you by Lord Rimoah. Its metallic pages appear to be as blank as when you first flicked through them, but then you turn to one page that is now very different. Coloured designs have appeared, surrounded by a ragged text which radiates a flickering spectrum of light. Using your Magnakai Discipline of pathsmanship, you are able to decipher much of this arcane writing.</p>
        <p>The text tells of a creature called Nza<ch.apos/>pok<ch.emdash/>Lord of the Mire<ch.emdash/>and of his throne of power which is located upon an islet at the mouth of the River of Flies. It describes the many vile deeds he has perpetrated for the cause of Evil, for which he has been greatly rewarded by Naar. The Dark God has granted him his own domain within the Plane of Darkness. It goes on to list the names of the creatures who are enslaved to him. But most interestingly it tells of a secret name<ch.emdash/><quote>Khula</quote><ch.emdash/>which can be used to bind him, and of an amulet which he possesses that will enable one to leave his territory. You study the text for some time and conclude that this swamp must be a part of Nza<ch.apos/>pok<ch.apos/>s realm. The pages of the tome seem to hold the key to the hierarchy of the Plane of Darkness and contain information that is needed to move from one domain to another. Unfortunately, not all of the book appears legible at any one time. You close the tome and slip it back into your pack. Your natural instincts tell you that the Moonstone is not to be found here in this swampland, and, in view of what you have discovered, you decide that you must escape from here as soon as possible. However, if you are to do so successfully you will first have to find Nza<ch.apos/>pok<ch.emdash/>the ruler of this domain<ch.emdash/>and take the amulet which he possesses. Suddenly your sixth sense warns you that the seemingly empty swamp harbours hidden enemies. They are distant but they are drawing closer with every passing minute. You get to your feet and look for the best route away from this mound, but only two ways offer any promise. To the south you see a shattered causeway of mouldering grey stones and, to the east, you catch sight of a shallow ridge that barely breaks the surface of the swamp.</p>

        <p>Upon entering the tunnel, the ground disappears beneath your feet and you begin to fall through darkness towards a pale speck of greyish light far below.

It is as if you are being lowered by an invisible cable down a dark, interminable mineshaft.</p>
        <p>As you slowly descend, your fear subsides and you take the opportunity to look at the ring which you cut from the hand of the K<ch.uuml/>nae.

You scan the tunnel in both directions and use your Kai senses to gather information. The faint sounds of hammering and scraping can be heard coming from somewhere above, and the symmetrical grooves which scar the tunnel walls tell you that this passage was excavated by some sort of gigantic burrowing machine.

        <p>The initial shock quickly passes and you surrender yourself to a long descent through a column of glimmering azure light. You feel your platinum amulet glowing warmly at your throat and you sense that it is protecting you from the rigours of this journey into the unknown.</p>
        <p>Looking down through the curtain of blue light, you can see the roofs of ziggurats and towers rising up to meet you. Gradually you slow to a halt and find yourself standing upon a circular dais of basalt rock atop a large, flat-roofed building. Several yards away to your left you see a squat tower, and to your right, standing at a parapet, you see a horny-skinned creature with wings that glimmer like folded sheets of gold leaf. Your pulse races when you recognize this creature to be a lavas, one of Naar<ch.apos/>s deadly minions. The lavas is peering idly at the view beyond the parapet and is unaware of your arrival, yet you are reluctant to leave the shimmering beam for fear that it may see you and raise an alarm.</p>

        <p>The sight of the approaching creatures stirs distant memories of the Temple of Maaken<ch.emdash/>the forbidden place which lies buried beneath the ruins of an old Sommlending city that teeters on the edge of the infamous Maakengorge. These winged horrors are Daemonaks, a breed of vampiric predators who were originally spawned by Lord Vashna<ch.emdash/>the first and mightiest Darklord leader. You first encountered one of their kind at Maaken, but now you face a flock of twenty such creatures.</p>
        <p>As they descend towards your hiding place they give vent to a piercing wail that makes your flesh crawl. The sound of their cries unsettles you, but this discomfort pales in comparison to the shock you experience upon seeing the response to their hideous cries.</p>

The anguished scream of Naar echoes through the corridors and dungeons of Dazganon.

        <p>Freed from the constraints of her prison, Alyss is able to use the power of the Moonstone to bring into being a Shadow Gate which materializes in the floor of the chamber.</p>

Here a ramshackle jetty, constructed from wood and bone, protrudes from the lee of a sand dune and out into the sluggish grey sea. Fringing the beach is dense jungle from where there suddenly arises a cacophony of hellish cries. You glimpse shadows moving in the undergrowth and when you stop momentarily to take a longer look, several arrows come shooting out of the trees. They arc towards you and explode when they hit the sand close by. Your Kai senses warn you that there are a great number of archers lurking in the jungle, far more than you can hope to defeat single-handedly. Anxious to escape while you are still able, you hurry down the beach to the jetty where you discover a sea-going canoe. Without daring to look back, you leap into this canoe, cast off its mooring rope, and paddle as fast as you can away from the shore.</p>
        <p>Once you feel sure that you are beyond arrow range, you attempt to follow the coastline in the hope of finding a safer place to put ashore. But a mist sweeps in across the water and engulfs your tiny craft before you can change course. This mist thickens rapidly to become a dense sea fog, the like of which you have never experienced. Despite your advanced Kai skills, you are unable to see through it and quickly you lose all sense of time and direction.</p>
        <p>After what seems like many hours, you eventually catch sight of a dark shape low in the water which, at first, appears to be a distant island. You paddle towards it but as you draw closer your senses suddenly scream a warning that you are heading into deadly danger. Instantly you reverse your stroke to change course, but it is already too late. Two slits open in the dark shape and a ghostly light washes over the fog-wreathed ocean. You feel the canoe lurch violently as it is hit by a powerful undercurrent and, in the next terrifying instant, you are sucked into the maw of a titanic subterranean sea creature and swallowed whole.</p>

The first is Lord Paido<ch.emdash/>the Vakeros warrior who accompanied you through the uncharted swamps of the Danarg and later sacrificed his life to protect yours in the infamous Darklord fortress of Torgar. The second is the face of Adamas<ch.emdash/>the Lord Constable of Garthen<ch.emdash/>who led the armies of Talestria and Palmyrion in the assault upon Torgar and perished during that fearsome siege. And the third is the bearded face of Seb Jarel<ch.emdash/>the brave Eruan partizan who guided you through the Hellswamp and, in so doing, forfeited his life.</p>
        <p>Your Kai senses detect that the souls of these three brave men are trapped upon this domain. Their spirits were captured by evil at the moment of their deaths and Naar has since condemned them to an eternity in the service of Avarvae the Tormentress. You see them mouthing words; they are pleading for you to release them from their torment, and your heart is torn by their silent, plaintive cries.</p>

        <p>The very instant you touch the ring it transforms into the mouth of a huge scaly worm. Your whole hand and forearm disappear into its fang-filled maw and, before you can save yourself, it snaps shut its powerful jaws. Red-hot agony engulfs your arm and sears your senses. Instinctively you pull away and, to your horror, you fall backwards with blood spilling freely from your severed limb. Cadak<ch.apos/>s malicious laughter fills your ears as, in a swirl of pain and confusion, you feel the numbing chill of shock begin to fill you with a deadly lethargy.</p>
        <p>Seated upon the two throne-like seats which adorn the great carcass appear the ghastly forms of the K<ch.uuml/>nae<ch.emdash/>the Lords of Decay. Their braying laughter echoes Cadak<ch.apos/>s vicious howl; they are clearly delighted by his use of base trickery to defeat you. Tragically, this awful sound is the last that you will ever hear. You have allowed yourself to be deceived by the spirit of the Arch Druid and you have paid the ultimate price. In a moment of sheer terror, the K<ch.uuml/>nae focus their terrible powers of disease and decay and turn them upon you, consigning you swiftly to oblivion.</p>
        <p>Sadly, your life and your quest end here in the dreaded Hall of the K<ch.uuml/>nae.</p>

        <p>As the last of the ghoulish horde falls to your deadly blows, you leap over its shattered body and break into a run. Unfortunately you do not get very far; a heavy weight hits you squarely in the back and knocks you to your knees. You struggle to regain your footing in the thick mud but your efforts are soon thwarted when you are suddenly engulfed by a coarse rope net dropped from above. Frantically you scrabble to untangle yourself, but a second net smothers the first and delays you just long enough for a pair of winged flyers to land on your back and force you down. Then another two of these demonic fliers come to assist them. While you are being subdued they hurriedly thread ropes through the edges of the nets and hurl the loose ends to others hovering above. Then, as one, the flock utters a chilling shriek of triumph. Your stomach churns and your heart pounds as you feel the net close in and hoist you off the ground.</p>

        <p>Relying on the element of surprise, you leap through the entrance and rush towards a gap in the line of advancing horrors. They immediately try to close ranks but their reactions are deathly slow and you are easily able to barge your way through them. Unfortunately you do not get very far; a heavy weight hits you squarely in the back and knocks you to your knees. As you struggle to stand in the thick mud you are engulfed by a coarse rope net dropped from above. Frantically you scrabble to untangle yourself, but a second net smothers the first and delays you long enough for the ghoulish horde to close in and pin you down. Two of the winged flyers descend close by and hurriedly they thread ropes through the edges of the nets. When their task is completed they shriek loudly and suddenly you feel yourself being hoisted aloft.</p>

        <p>Your masterly construction of a strong defensive mental barrier deflects all of the combined psychic energies that are ranged against you. The full power of their attack rebounds upon them with devastating effect. The Lieutenants of Night fall screaming to the floor where they writhe in agony like wounded snakes. The Demoness reels and totters backwards, slumps down heavily upon her throne, and then grips her disfigured head with both hands as she struggles in vain to regain control of her mind.</p>
        <p>Seizing your advantage, you unsheathe your weapon and rush forward. With two swift and deadly blows you dispatch the lieutenants in passing and then rush towards Shamath<ch.apos/>s gigantic throne. Through the red haze of the agony that fills her head, the Demoness sees you approaching.</p>
        <p>Immediately she slams her right hand down upon the arm of her throne, to where a glowing opal is set into the stone.</p>
        <p><quote>Gnekasha!</quote> you scream, giving voice to her secret name, and she freezes as still as a stone statue. But not before her clenched fist has struck the glowing gem.</p>
        <p>Suddenly you hear a terrible sound; it is the screams and cries of Shamath<ch.apos/>s vengeful legions. With dread you glance over your shoulder and look to the source of the cacophony<ch.emdash/>the chamber of tunnels beyond the archway of the Throne Room. What you see there sends an icy cold shiver of fear coursing down your spine.</p>

Aware now that the Lord of Decay seated on the right-hand throne is Jantoor, you shout his secret name and immediately the creature becomes immobile. The sight of his frozen form, and the sudden cessation of mind contact, throws his brother-lord into a state of panic and confusion.

        <p>The moment you enter the beam, you feel yourself descending through the centre of the temple in a cocoon of shimmering blue light. Gradually the heat of the nest of fire gives way to a pleasant coolness, but as you continue your descent deeper and deeper into the unknown, this equable temperature slowly transforms into an unbearable icy chill. Never before have you experienced the terrible coldness that engulfs you now. Fortunately, the magical properties of the Scarab of the Wingless Dragon protect and keep you from freezing to death. (Record this Scarab on your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a> as a Special Item which you keep in your pocket.)</p>
        <p>As the temperature slowly begins to rise, you are able to examine the scarab that you took from Huan<ch.apos/>zhor<ch.apos/>s nest, and at once you notice two runic numerals on the back of the wingless dragon, engraved on its surface. (The numerals comprise the number 31. Make a note of this number in the margin of your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a> for future reference.) Having satisfied your curiosity, you place the scarab into the pocket of your tunic and wait patiently for the beam to complete its seemingly endless descent.</p>
        <p>Eventually the shimmering light fades and you feel solid ground materialize beneath your feet once more. Stretching before you now lies a gigantic cavern. Its walls of cracked and stained obsidian rise to a high-arched roof where twelve stalactites of glowing lime-green stone form a circle. On the floor directly below this circle are the shattered remains of a crystal dais, its broken fragments glimmering in the cavern<ch.apos/>s eerie, icy gloom.</p>

Gradually you slow to a halt and find yourself standing upon a circular dais of basalt rock atop a large, flat-roofed building. Several yards away to your left you see a squat tower, and to your right, standing at a parapet, you see a horny-skinned creature with wings that glimmer like folded sheets of gold leaf. Your pulse races when you recognize this creature to be a lavas, one of Naar<ch.apos/>s deadly minions.

Stillness returns and your natural curiosity, coupled with a gnawing desire to find the Moonstone, prompts you to explore the new passageway.

With a snickering sound, it crinkles back its snout and allows a stream of saliva to trickle freely from its quavering jaw.

        <p>You cast your gaze around the mouldering walls of this dimly-lit vault and feel a surge of joy and relief well up from the pit of your stomach. The dripping granite is cold and cheerless, but to your eyes, having witnessed the horrors of Naar<ch.apos/>s throne hall, this dank stone vault looks warm, welcoming, and reassuringly familiar. You have returned to the secret burial chamber below the Necropolis of Tyso<ch.emdash/>the place from where you began your journey through the Shadow Gate some time ago. With Alyss<ch.apos/>s help you have arrived home safely to Sommerlund.</p>
        <p>No trace of the Shadow Gate remains; it vanished the moment you emerged from the cocoon of light and took your first tentative steps into the vault. With eager anticipation you leave the chamber and hurriedly ascend to the surface where you are greeted by warm summer sunshine. The commander of Tyso is Baron Tor Medar, and two of his stewards are dutifully guarding the gates to the city<ch.apos/>s necropolis. When they see you emerge from a mausoleum close by, their jaws drop open in amazement as simultaneously they recognize who you are from the cut and colour of your Grand Master robes. Upon recovering their senses, the stewards volunteer to escort you directly to Baron Medar<ch.apos/>s castle. During the brief journey through the city you are shocked to learn that a whole year has passed since you entered the Shadow Gate, even though the time that you spent upon the Plane of Darkness seemed no more than a few days at most.</p>
        <p>Baron Medar is an old and trusted friend and he welcomes your safe return to Tyso with a show of great warmth and affection. Having feared for the past year that you had perished during your pursuit of Wolf<ch.apos/>s Bane, he is clearly delighted to hear that not only did you survive your ordeal beyond the Shadow Gate, but that you also vanquished the impostor. Naturally you are anxious to return to your Kai brethren without delay and Medar gladly offers his help. He gives you the finest horse in his stables and assigns a troop of his personal bodyguards to escort you swiftly across Sommerlund to the Kai Monastery.</p>
        <p>At the monastery you receive a rapturous reception from the ranks of the Kai, for whom your return is the fulfilment of a year<ch.apos/>s hopes and prayers. Firestone, the most senior of the New Order warriors, despatches journeymen to carry word of your triumphant return to the King in Holmgard and to Guildmaster Banedon<ch.emdash/>the leader of the magicians&apos; guild in Toran. Firestone had rightly assumed command during your absence and, as he accompanies you through the grounds of the monastery to your vault below the Tower of the Sun, you commend him on how well he has conducted his stewardship of the monastery and the training of the Kai in his charge.</p>
        <p><quote>Thank you, my lord,</quote> he says with pride, <quote>yet truly I cannot lay claim to all of the credit. My duties would have been far harder to fulfil had it not been for the invaluable aid I<ch.apos/>ve received from your wise advisors<ch.emdash/>Lord Rimoah and Lord Ardan of Dessi.</quote></p>
        <p>These two Old Kingdom magicians<ch.emdash/>Lords Rimoah and Ardan<ch.emdash/>greet you the moment you enter the vault. Ever since you disappeared into the Shadow Gate a year ago, they have resided at the monastery so that they could assist Firestone with the task of training the New Order Kai.</p>
        <p><quote>We sensed that you were still alive somewhere in the void beyond the universe of Aon,</quote> says Rimoah, beaming delightedly, <quote>but neither I nor Ardan were able to discern when precisely you would return to Sommerlund. Come, Grand Master, tell us of your adventures beyond the Shadow Gate.</quote></p>
        <p>Eagerly they listen to your account of how you tracked and defeated Wolf<ch.apos/>s Bane and escaped from the throne hall of the Dark God. But it is your surprise revelation that Naar possesses the Moonstone of the Shianti which seems to fascinate and frighten them the most.</p>
        <p><quote>This is grave news indeed, Lone Wolf,</quote> says Lord Rimoah, in a suddenly sombre tone. <quote>The Moonstone contains great power. It can create life and it can also destroy life<ch.emdash/>utterly. If Naar were able to fully harness its power he could use it to destroy all life on Magnamund. I fear it is just a matter of time before he fathoms its secrets. The Moonstone was once a blessing for the creatures of this world. In Naar<ch.apos/>s hand it could become the curse of us all.</quote></p>
        <p><quote>I for one shall not permit this,</quote> you reply defiantly. <quote>I shall find the means to return to the Plane of Darkness and retrieve the Moonstone. This I vow. For Sommerlund and the Kai<ch.emdash/>so long as I live, Naar will never conquer Magnamund!</quote></p>
        <p><quote>Your courage is an inspiration to us all, Grand Master,</quote> says Lord Ardan respectfully.</p>
        <p><quote>Aye, to us all,</quote> echoes Lord Rimoah. <quote>And be assured, Lone Wolf, soon you will have the opportunity to enact your pledge, for it is within our power to help you fulfil your vow.</quote></p>

As his foul form wobbles with undisguised mirth, you quickly unshoulder your backpack and tear open the flap to retrieve the Tome of Darkness. Nza<ch.apos/>pok ceases to laugh when he glimpses its jet black cover for he is aware of its origins and the powerful secrets it contains.</p>
        <p>With a terse growl, he gives the signal to his minions and they hurl their spears into the pit with chilling accuracy. You are struck by more than a dozen of these deadly lances. Mercifully, unlike most who have fallen foul of Nza<ch.apos/>pok, your death is swift and painless.</p>
        <p>Sadly, your life and your quest for the Moonstone end here.</p>

        <p>You consider ignoring the combination lock and forcing your way through the trapdoor, but your Kai sixth sense warns you against this. The shielding spell which protects this hatch is terrifyingly powerful. If you were to force an entry the sudden release of this power would turn you, and your platinum amulet, into glowing cinders in the blink of an eye. Out of frustration you tap a number of the hollows at random, in the hope of hitting the correct sequence, but unfortunately this activates a silent alarm which attracts a host of lavas to the temple. They swoop in, surround your hiding place, and then launch a merciless attack. You fight them bravely, dispatching more than a dozen before you are finally overwhelmed by their sheer weight of numbers. Sadly, your life and your quest end here in the Temple of Huan<ch.apos/>zhor.</p>

The lavas fails to detect you. Upon reaching the archway you quickly descend a spiral stairway to a landing, one level below, where you see something that makes you freeze in your tracks.</p>

        <p>The hyena-beast shrieks and twists its head violently. Then it suddenly opens its great jaw and coughs up a ball of vile phlegm which it spits at you with stunning force. You dive to the floor to avoid being hit by this evil-smelling projectile and it speeds over your shoulder to splatter loudly against the portal.

        <p>You descend the spiral stairs to the base of the tower and make your way quickly through the narrow alleys of this subterranean settlement. Your Kai camouflage skills keep you hidden from the lavas and dragons that soar overhead, and you are able to reach the edge of the quarry unnoticed. Here you observe teams of reptillians chiselling freshly quarried stone into perfect cubes. Other teams load these heavy blocks into nets, fourteen to each, and then fix them by hooks and harness to the dragons who transport them across to the far side of the chasm.</p>
        <p>Stealthily you make your approach to an area where full nets are awaiting transport. Using your Magnakai Discipline of Nexus, you open a sealed net and hide yourself inside among the blocks of stone before closing up the seal behind you. Minutes later you hear the beat of large wings and the frenzied chattering of the reptillian work crews as they struggle to affix the net to a dragon<ch.apos/>s harness. Then the wings beat faster and you feel yourself swinging free from the ground. Slowly the great dragon hauls its heavy cargo into the air. As it begins to level out, you peer down through a gap in the blocks to see the chasm looming nearer. Then you see a river of scarlet lava flowing along the base of this great divide, more than a mile deep. The dragon is approaching the far side when suddenly it dips its huge head and looks down at the cargo hanging below its belly. An icicle of fear stabs your heart when you see its ghoulish eye staring directly at the place where you are hiding.</p>

        <p>With a nod of his head he motions to Lord Ardan who then retrieves an almost identical amulet from among the items on the table. Ardan gives the amulet to Rimoah and he slips it into his pocket.</p>
        <p><quote>You<ch.apos/>ll not be requiring this after all,</quote> he says, <quote>but there is something which I<ch.apos/>m sure you will find most useful. And I<ch.apos/>m certain that you have not come across anything of its like before.</quote></p>
        <p>Once again Rimoah motions to Ardan and the elderly wizard responds by taking up a small package that is wrapped in a silk handkerchief. Carefully he unfolds the patterned silk square to reveal a book which is bound in jet-black hide. A wave of nausea makes you swallow hard as your natural Kai instincts detect that the origins of this book are wholly evil. Ardan offers it to you and, reluctantly, you take it from him.</p>
        <p><quote>It was discovered a decade ago in Northern Dessi,</quote> says Ardan. <quote>A party of our brethren found it on the Isle of Khor. It was buried in the ruins of Kazan-Oud.</quote></p>
        <p>Carefully you open the stiff black cover and, to your surprise, you discover that the inner pages comprise several sheets of pliable metal.

We of the High Council believe it contains information about the many realms and territories within Naar<ch.apos/>s domain. It may help guide you to the location of his throne hall and, with luck, to the Moonstone of the Shianti.</quote></p>

You look down to the vent at its centre and your suspicions are further aroused when you note that it is perfectly symmetrical. No natural volcanic forces could have created this precisely circular hole and it prompts you to slide into the cone to take a closer look. When you reach the vent you discover it consists of a circular platform of carved stone blocks with a well-like opening at its middle. It immediately reminds you of the Tahou Cauldron<ch.emdash/>a well in the centre of the city of Tahou which gives access to the ancient subterranean city of Zaaryx located a mile below its streets. However, unlike the open vent of the Tahou Cauldron, this hole is filled with a shimmering blue light.</p>

They wield lances wreathed with white flames and their eyes are pin-points of red fire.</p>

        <p>The piles of building materials and the partially-finished dwellings which surround the base of the main temple make it easy for you to approach this edifice without being seen. Your Kai senses confirm that this grand construction is the lair of Huan<ch.apos/>zhor; the master of this fiery domain, and they also confirm that the evil Dragonlord is not in residence. You skirt around the base of the temple until you locate an entrance which is guarded by two armoured reptillians. Using your Magnakai skills you lure these guards away from their posts just long enough for you to gain entry. Once inside, you discover that at ground level the temple comprises just one large chamber which is supported by a single central pillar that runs through the middle of the building. A circular stair winds around the outside of this pillar, giving access to the levels above. Cautiously you ascend the stairs and pass through four levels, all empty. The higher you climb, the hotter it becomes until, when you reach the uppermost tier of the temple, only your platinum amulet saves you from being roasted alive. In the roof of this narrow circular chamber you discover an open trapdoor through which you can see a mass of flickering orange flames. You sense that it is the base of the nest of fire, the location, as told in the Tome of Darkness, of the Scarab of the Wingless Dragon<ch.emdash/>the artifact that can secure your escape from this domain. With bated breath you climb the scorched steps which lead to the open trapdoor in the base of the nest of fire, but as you draw closer, your sixth senses warn you that the opening is not all it seems. It is protected by an invisible shield of magical energy.</p>

Warily you leave the jungle, make your way around the fruits, and hurry across the clearing towards a statue which is crouching among the ruins. It is constructed of a smooth, lustrous black mineral and is fashioned in the likeness of some evil beast of prey.

        <p>You accompany the members of the secret council to the deepest chamber below the Guildhall wherein lies the Daziarn Portal. It is a perpetual entrance to a Shadow Gate and is one of only a handful which exist upon Magnamund. For many centuries the magicians of Toran have used this portal to banish criminals and traitors from Sommerlund, believing that it led to the limbo of deep space from where there could be no escape. However, in recent years their understanding of this portal has greatly increased following your own journeys through similar Shadow Gates. Inspired by your accounts of your experiences on the planes of existence which lie beyond the material universe of Aon, and by their own experimentation, the Brotherhood magicians and the Elders of the High Council of Dessi have since been able to achieve limited control over the forces which exist within these supernatural portals.</p>
        <p>Using this newly acquired knowledge of Shadow Gates coupled to their powerful arcane lore, the council members begin preparations for a ritual which will culminate with you stepping into the Daziarn Portal. Rimoah oversees the drawing of an intricate pentagram upon the flagstones at the threshold of the portal, whilst Guildmaster Banedon instructs his guildsmen in the recital of complex spell chants and the placing of magical artifacts at key points around the chamber. The preparations are painstaking and lengthy. During this period you reflect on the quest you have vowed to undertake and Lord Rimoah takes time to reassure you of the vital importance of your mission. He also offers you some magical items which could prove invaluable during your quest for the Moonstone.</p>

        <p>Seated on the two throne-like chairs perched upon the back of the rotting carcass appear the ghastly forms of the K<ch.uuml/>nae<ch.emdash/>the Lords of Decay. They are a hideous sight, and your stomach churns with revulsion as you struggle to comprehend their abominable manifestation. Their torsoes resemble two mounds of glistening black jelly, studded with polyps and ulcers and sores that exude a noxious grey slime. They have flat heads that are oval-shaped and shell-like, with puckered mouths and indented eye-slits that radiate an evil yellow light. From their rubbery sides protrude two snaky limbs ending in three-fingered hands coloured a sickly, leprous green-grey. And fixed upon the first fingers of their right hands you see rings of gleaming gold that are exquisitely crafted and embellished with intricate patterns. These rings are exceptionally beautiful and seem glaringly out of place upon the fingers of these grotesque beings.</p>
        <p>As you stare at the rings you recall the text of the Tome of Darkness and its instruction that if you are to leave this rotting domain, you must first obtain a ring from the K<ch.uuml/>nae.

        <p>Gradually the sea mist clears and you catch sight of land on the horizon. Your senses tingle with expectation for you have now entered a new realm of the Plane of Darkness and you are aware of several dramatic changes to your immediate surroundings. The sluggish grey sea has become a muddy brown sludge that clings to your paddle like marsh slime. Every time you break the crusty surface a cloud of tiny black insects erupts from the slime and soars into the warm, fetid air. The sky above is no longer green; it is a bilious yellow and it is streaked with high clouds that flash intermittently with sheet lightning.</p>
        <p>Despite the glue-like consistency of the ocean, you detect a strong tidal undertow. Rather than fight it you decide to cease paddling and allow it to carry you towards the distant shore. While you wait for the current to do its work, you retrieve the Tome of Darkness from your backpack and turn through its pages in the hope of learning some of the secrets of this new, foul-smelling realm.</p>
        <p>The page that revealed to you information about Nza<ch.apos/>pok<ch.apos/>s realm is now blank, but the one following it has changed in both colour and texture. Lines of spidery writing have appeared on a page that now looks and feels like cured animal hide. Once again, using your Magnakai Discipline of pathsmanship, you are able to decipher much of this arcane text.</p>
        <p>The writings tell of two powerful beings called the K<ch.uuml/>nae<ch.emdash/>the Lords of Decay<ch.emdash/>and of their throne of power which is located upon <quote>the rotting corpse of Ghandezh<ch.emdash/>the Wyrm of Naaros</quote>. You scan the page, passing over a long list of vile deeds that have earned the K<ch.uuml/>nae the right to rule their ignoble realm, until you come to the part which details the secret names which can bind them. The names are <quote>Jantoor</quote> and <quote>Rhunadan</quote>. The text instructs those who would use these names in the presence of the K<ch.uuml/>nae to exercise great caution, for if the name that is spoken is not directed at the correct Lord of Decay, the <quote>evocator will sacrifice his body and soul and be enslaved to the K<ch.uuml/>nae forever upon the realm of putrefaction</quote>. The text gives no indication of how to identify each of the K<ch.uuml/>nae and does not state how and when their secret names should be used to bind them. Yet it does state that in order to leave their realm one must possess a <quote>ring of power</quote>, one of two such rings which exist and are worn <quote>upon the first fingers of the right hands of the K<ch.uuml/>nae</quote>.</p>
        <p>You close the tome and stow it in your backpack. Time has passed rapidly while you have been consulting the book, and your canoe is now but a few hundred yards from the shore.

You focus on these and your Kai senses reveal them to be part of a combination lock which activates the spell that protects this hatch. If you press the correct number of hollows in the correct order; you will cause the shielding spell to vanish.</p>
        <p>Carefully you study the engravings and decipher a series of clues within their shapes which help you to deduce the correct number of hollows, and the order in which they must be pressed. This secret sequence is equal to exactly half the value of the runic number inscribed on the inner band of the K<ch.uuml/>nae Ring.</p>

        <p>You are halfway across the bridge when you are spotted by a lavas passing high overhead. Immediately it signals to two of its companions and all three creatures swoop down to block your exit. Their cries of alarm attract more than two dozen of their kin, and also alert a party of reptillians at the chasm<ch.apos/>s edge. At a given command they close in and attack you mercilessly with their spears and tridents. You fight them with stunning bravery, dispatching more than ten lavas and seven reptillians before eventually you succumb to their sheer weight of numbers.

Beyond these curious fruits you can see the ruins of a settlement partially overgrown with moss. Warily you leave the jungle, making your way around the fruits, and hurry across the clearing towards a statue which is crouching among the ruins. It is constructed of a smooth, lustrous black mineral and is fashioned in the likeness of some evil beast of prey. It reminds you of a hyena, but one with a massive lower jaw set with a pair of sabre-toothed fangs. Between its forelegs is a flight of rubble-strewn steps leading down to an open door.

        <p>With trepidation you cast your eyes around the walls of this fiery nest to see a great shaking panoply of gold, orange and crimson flames. They shoot fifteen paces into the air and, despite your protections, they scorch you with their terrible heat. The floor of the nest is paved with glowing black metal and is heaped with scores of wondrous artifacts that comprise Huan<ch.apos/>zhor<ch.apos/>s secret treasure hoard. Gems, jewellery, statuettes, armour and weapons of fiendish design and purpose are piled knee-high all around you. Close by the trapdoor you notice a pool of shimmering blue light that you immediately recognize to be an apex of a transporter beam, similar to that which brought you here from the crater. By its location you judge that it must pass through the central column which supports the nest and the temple below.

This transporter beam leads to another realm within the Plane of Darkness.</p>

Through the flickering wall of flames you glimpse the outline of a gigantic dragon as it emerges from a vent in the roof on the far side of the chasm. Immediately, a deathly silence fills the great cavern as the lavas and reptillians cease their activities and bow in deference to their master.

        <p>This circular hall is chillingly familiar, although you are sure that you have never been here before. Then a cold shiver runs down your spine when suddenly you recall where it was that you saw a chamber and runes uncannily similar to these. It was in Mogaruith, in the antechamber to Arch Druid Cadak<ch.apos/>s Throne Hall.</p>
        <p>You magnify your vision and focus on the runes that decorate the floor. They are similar to those you encountered on the portal to this subterranean labyrinth when first you entered, and you feel your pulse quicken when slowly you are able to decipher part of their meaning:</p>
        <p><quote>Ye who seek entry to the Hall of the K<ch.uuml/>nae, renounce all falsehood and trickery for thou art transparent beneath our gaze. Pay homage to the Lords of Decay lest thy soul be devoured by the insatiable horde of Nemagog. Place gold within the circle for thy wish to be fulfilled; base metal without for thy fate to be sealed.</quote></p>
        <p>With great caution, you cross the floor of the chamber and examine the engraved surface of the portal after a gentle push confirms that the door is locked. You were hoping that the runes which cover this great metal portal would reveal how it can be opened, but to your dismay they merely catalogue (in sickening detail) the evil accomplishments of the K<ch.uuml/>nae. Then you discover three small slots: one circular, one square and one triangular in shape.</p>

        <p>Before the Demoness and her Lieutenants of Night can focus their attack, you use your improved Kai Discipline to launch a hasty psychic assault on all three beings simultaneously. Your rapid bolts of psychic power penetrate their defences and short-circuit their minds with devastating effect. The Lieutenants of Night fall screaming to the floor where they writhe in agony like wounded snakes. The Demoness reels and totters backwards, slumps down heavily upon her throne, and then grips her disfigured head with both hands as she struggles in vain to regain control of her mind.</p>
        <p>Seizing your advantage, you unsheathe your weapon and rush forward. With two swift and deadly blows you dispatch the lieutenants in passing and then rush towards Shamath<ch.apos/>s gigantic throne. Through the red haze of the agony that fills her head, the Demoness sees you approaching. Immediately she slams her right hand down upon the arm of her throne, to where a glowing opal is set into the stone.</p>

        <p>Through a square hole in the wall of the tower; you catch your first clear view of this subterranean domain which lies deep beneath the crater. Nestling within a colossal cavern of crimson lava-rock, you look out across an alien city that is split in two by a steep-sided chasm. Lavas swoop back and forth across this divide while their wingless comrades traverse it by means of a narrow bridge constructed from blocks of blue-grey basalt. As you stare at the stubby towers and flat-roofed dwellings clustered on either side, your heart suddenly skips a beat. Perched upon a vast mound of shiny black cubes on the far side of the chasm you see a temple. Carvings of dragons embellish its angular surfaces, engraved in such a fashion that their scaly bodies lie recumbent around the base of the edifice whilst their tails writhe towards its highest level. Here they become entwined to form a twisted stem. Atop this stem, like branches fanning out above the trunk of a petrified tree, you see an inverted cupola of bright orange flames<ch.emdash/>a nest of fire. Your senses confirm that you have found the lair of Huan<ch.apos/>zhor the Dragonlord, as revealed in the Tome of Darkness. This is the nest of fire which lies upon the Tree of the Wyrm, and it is here that you will find the scarab that will allow you to leave Huan<ch.apos/>zhor<ch.apos/>s hellish domain. Quietly you resolve to reach the distant temple and achieve this aim.</p>
        <p>You magnify your vision and your hopes rise when you see that both the fiery nest and the temple appear to be uninhabited. However, your enthusiasm is soon tempered when you consider how you can reach the far side undetected. For several minutes you observe the lavas flying over the chasm and the traffic of wingless reptillians who cross via the bridge. The construction of new dwellings is taking place on the far side and the lavas are busy overseeing the transportation of building blocks from a quarry situated close to the tower in which you are standing. Under the direction of the lavas, a steady convoy of winged dragons transports these quarried blocks across the chasm in great nets which are slung beneath their bellies. As you watch this activity, you formulate two ways of reaching the far side. You could attempt to cross the bridge during a lull in the traffic, or you could try to stow away in one of the nets being ferried across by the lumbering dragons.</p>

        <p>The few remaining insects that survive your blows hurriedly flee across the swamp and disappear into a curtain of acidic rain. Mindful of the damage this rain is inflicting upon your clothes and equipment, you turn and run back towards the pile of fallen slabs. The hollow beneath these stones is now empty of insects and so you squeeze yourself through a gap and take shelter here.</p>
        <p>As you wait for the rain to abate, you inspect the inside of the hollow and the pendulous insect hive. Despite the seemingly haphazard lie of the stone slabs, the rain does not penetrate into the interior and the inside of the hollow stays remarkably dry. On the ground lies a thick carpet of soft leathery leaves. They are spattered with a yellow, honey-like substance which is oozing from the base of the hive. It smells sweet but your Kai senses warn you not to taste any: it is poisonous. (If you wish to take some of this, record it on your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a> as Muntaag Honey. You can wrap it in a leaf and store it as a Backpack Item.)</p>
        <p>You are busy cleaning the acidic rain from your equipment with a handful of leaves when suddenly your sixth sense warns you of approaching danger. You peer out through a crack in the stones and catch sight of a flock of bat-winged creatures. They are swooping down from out of the rainy sky towards your hiding place.</p>

        <p>You take a running leap at the table and grab the phial from the pillow. Then, as your feet return to the ground, you stagger forwards and throw yourself behind Shamath<ch.apos/>s great Throne of Power. Crouching here with fear running cold in your veins, you listen to the hiss of the first crossbow bolts and the screams of the approaching horde. Then you notice the waters of the strange pool which lies no more than a dozen yards away from the throne. Beyond this pool you see the pair of huge black gates which dominates the far wail of the chamber and suddenly you recall the text which appeared in the Tome of Darkness. This is the Pool of Sorrows, and beyond it lie the Gates of Darkness<ch.emdash/>an exit from this cruel domain. Your feelings of excitement at having discovered a way to escape the approaching horde are tempered when you further recall that you must spill your own blood into the pool if you are to leave this realm successfully.</p>
        <p>With little hesitation, you stab a finger against the point of your belt buckle and draw a few droplets of blood. Then you spring to your feet and rush towards the pool.

        <p>The hyena-beast suddenly opens its great jaw and coughs up a ball of vile phlegm which it spits at you with stunning force. You dive to the floor to avoid being hit by this evil-smelling projectile and it speeds over your shoulder to splatter loudly against the portal. Droplets of saliva spray the back of your legs, leaving tiny white stains where it instantly removes the checked dyes from your breeches. You wipe your legs with the hem of your cloak but your stomach heaves when you detect that the creature<ch.apos/>s saliva contains a virulent plague bacteria.</p>
        <p>Fortunately, your innate Magnakai Disciplines of Nexus and Curing immediately neutralize this deadly plague virus, rendering it harmless to you. The creature howls with anger and frustration; it has never before encountered any living being capable of resisting its deadly plague-ridden saliva, and your unexpected survival makes it feel suddenly anxious and unsure.</p>

        <p>The net spills open as it touches the ground beside the yawning pit, enabling you quickly to disentangle yourself and unsheathe a weapon. Freed from the net but still trembling from the residual effects of psychic shock, you drop to one knee to steady yourself as you try to assess your situation. You look around for a way to escape from this alien settlement but all that you can see is an encircling wall of hideous humanoid mutants and ant-creatures. A tight wedge, comprising a dozen of these creatures, gibbers excitedly as it rushes forwards with frightening speed. You attempt to stand and meet their attack, but they hit you before you are fully upright and knock you headlong into the pit.</p>
        <p>Cursing your luck, you struggle to your feet amongst a deep carpet of bones and look up at the rim of the pit, some fifteen feet above. An unbroken line of ghastly faces are shrieking and staring back at you with unconcealed glee. Then suddenly the faces fall silent and a gap appears in their ranks to allow access to their hideous leader. You swallow hard to suppress the rising nausea you feel upon seeing this creature<ch.apos/>s grotesque features. Its body resembles a huge bloated bubble, endowed with a misshapen humanoid face<ch.emdash/>like that moulded by a child from wet clay. Its pustulant raw skin is studded with warts and tufts of rust-coloured hair. Chuckling maniacally, it drags itself around the edge of the pit by means of six claw-tipped tentacles and you note, with disgust, that it leaves a trail of steaming grey slime wherever it passes. Through its bulbous lower lip there hangs a chain to which is attached an amulet, seemingly crafted of iron. You magnify your vision and see that an inscription on this crude amulet bears the name <quote>Nza<ch.apos/>pok</quote>. Instantly you recall the text of the Tome of Darkness and realize that this creature must be Nza<ch.apos/>pok himself<ch.emdash/>the ruler of this territory within the Plane of Darkness.</p>
        <p>Nza<ch.apos/>pok opens his crooked mouth to reveal several rows of rotting jagged teeth. Then words of the Dark Tongue rumble from his gullet to send shivers down your spine. You suspect that he is commanding his followers to slay you and your worst fears are confirmed when you witness spears being passed overhead to the front ranks of his chaos-horde. The humanoids snatch them up in their twisted hands and raise them in readiness to hurl at you upon the word of command from their hellish leader.</p>

This expanse of level ground is devoid of foliage yet it is littered with strange fruits that resemble gigantic grey pineapples. Beyond these curious fruits you can see the ruins of a settlement partially overgrown with moss. Warily you leave the jungle, make your way around the fruits, and hurry across the clearing towards a statue which is crouching among the ruins. It is constructed of a smooth, lustrous black mineral and is fashioned in the likeness of some evil beast of prey. It reminds you of a hyena, but one with a massive lower jaw set with a pair of sabre-toothed fangs. Between its forelegs is a flight of rubble-strewn steps leading down to an open door.

        <p><quote>It was discovered a decade ago in Northern Dessi,</quote> he says. <quote>A party of our brethren found it on the Isle of Khor. It was found buried in the ruins of Kazan-Oud.</quote></p>

        <p>Icy fingers of fear grip your heart when you see the huge, dread form of the Demoness Shamath seated upon the marble throne. She is slumped forward over the adjacent table, her face buried in her crossed arms as if she is asleep. The few remaining parts of her body which are visible appear to be sheathed in sections of shiny black armour. You note that it is the same armour she wore when you defeated her five years ago.</p>
        <p>Suddenly the sound of approaching footsteps echos from one of the nearby tunnels. Anxious to avoid the risk of a confrontation, you slip into Shamath<ch.apos/>s chamber and take cover behind one of the icy pillars that encircle the walls. Moments later, you see two robed figures glide into the chamber. They are carrying between them a large phial of golden fluid which rests upon a pillow of purple silk. As they pass close by your hiding place, you hastily call upon your Kai skills to mask your physical and mental presence.</p>

        <p>You hurry away along a track that winds through the settlement of huts and down to a beach covered with coarse black sand. Here a ramshackle jetty, constructed from wood and bone, protrudes from the lee of a sand dune and out into the sluggish grey sea. Fringing the beach is dense jungle from where there suddenly arises a cacophony of hellish cries. You glimpse shadows moving in the undergrowth and when you stop momentarily to take a longer look, several arrows come shooting out of the trees. They arc towards you and explode when they hit the sand close by. Your Kai senses warn you that there are a great number of archers lurking in the jungle, far more than you can hope to defeat single-handedly. Anxious to escape while you are still able, you hurry down the beach to the jetty where you discover a sea-going canoe. Without daring to look back, you leap into this canoe, cast off its mooring rope, and paddle as fast as you can away from the shore.</p>
        <p>Once you feel sure that you are beyond arrow range, you attempt to follow the coastline in the hope of finding a safer place to put ashore. But a mist sweeps in across the water and engulfs your tiny craft before you can change course. This mist thickens rapidly to become a dense sea fog, the like of which you have never experienced. Despite your advanced Kai skills, you are unable to see through it and quickly you lose all sense of time and direction.</p>
        <p>After what seems like many hours, you eventually catch sight of a dark shape low in the water which, at first, appears to be a distant island. You paddle towards it but as you draw closer you sense that all is not what it seems. Then you feel a warm glow radiating from the pocket of your robe and discover that it is the Nza<ch.apos/>pok Amulet. Carefully you remove it and, guided purely by instinct, you hold this glowing disc of iron above your head. In the distance you can hear the sound of rushing water which is followed by an incredible sight: the island is sinking slowly into the sea. In less than a minute it has completely disappeared without trace. The amulet no longer glows and so you slip it back into your pocket before continuing your eerie voyage across this uncharted ocean.</p>

The hypnotic chanting of the Brotherhood magicians rises in tempo and you feel gusts of icy wind play upon your face.

You fight bravely but your resistance is ultimately to no avail; you are captured, disarmed, blinded and hurled from the battlements of Dazganon out onto the Plain of Despair; where you are attacked by thousands of vengeful spirits, many of whom were slayed by your hand. Your physical death is swift, but tragically your spirit is doomed to spend the rest of eternity running endlessly with the host of lost souls upon the Plain of Despair.</p>
        <p>Tragically, your life and your quest end here.</p>

        <p>You draw Skarn-Ska from its korlinium scabbard and sense at once that its mere physical presence within this throne hall is causing the K<ch.uuml/>nae a great deal of discomfort. You detect a surge of anxiety in the mental communication passing between them. The creature seated upon the left throne becomes agitated and begins to flail the foul air with its snaky limbs. Then it utters a sinister command to its partner and you hear the words echo in your mind: <quote>Slay him, Jantoor!</quote></p>
        <p>The creature seated upon the right throne responds immediately. It raises its right limb and a gout of fire shoots from the palm of its leprous hand and comes speeding towards your chest.</p>

        <p>You settle yourself down on the stone floor of the empty hut and, as you wait for the rain to abate, you busy yourself by cleaning the acidic rain from your equipment. After a few minutes your sixth sense warns you of approaching danger. You peer out through the open doorway and catch sight of a flock of bat-winged creatures that are flying low over the surrounding trees. Suddenly they turn in mid-air and come swooping down from out of the rainy sky towards your hiding place.</p>

        <p>You utter the words of the Old Kingdom Spell <spell>Invisible Fist</spell> and thrust your clenched right hand at the attacking creature. The beast is in mid-air when an invisible shock wave hits it squarely in the face and sends it spinning head over tail to crash heavily against the wall. Limp and unconscious, the beast slides down the moisture-slick wall and arrives at the bottom of the ramp in a tangled heap.</p>
        <p>While it is still unconscious you turn your attention to the portal and examine its surface in an attempt to find a way to open it. Using your advanced Kai skills you are able to decipher enough of the runic text to discover the secret code which keeps it secure. Confidently you press a section of the surface and, just as you believe it will, it moves inwards with an audible <onomatopoeia>clunk!</onomatopoeia> Moments later the portal creaks open and you hurry through, slamming it shut behind you to prevent the beast from following in your wake when eventually it recovers its senses.</p>

        <p>As you tumble into the dark vortex of this newly-created Shadow Gate, you see the glow of the Moonstone illuminating the silhouette of Alyss in the middle distance. Behind and above, the mouth of the gate by which you entered the abyss is rapidly shrinking. Alyss is using the power of the Moonstone once more, this time to seal the gate in Naar<ch.apos/>s inner sanctum to prevent his fell minions from following you home to Toran.</p>
        <p>The deeper you fall into the spiraling darkness so it seems the stronger Alyss becomes. Gripping the precious Moonstone with both hands, she extends her arms and glides easily through the whirling funnel towards you. As she draws level, you hear her speaking softly in your mind:</p>
        <p><quote>Thank you, Grand Master. I shall never forget what you have done for me. Had you not returned when you did I would have forfeited my freedom to the Dark God. And freedom, to me, is the most precious of things. For without freedom I would cease to be.</quote></p>
        <p>For a moment, the whirling frigid darkness of the Shadow Gate is illuminated brightly by the flaring rays of the Moonstone. Alyss passes the sacred artifact into your safe keeping, kisses you fondly on the cheek, and with the parting words<ch.emdash/><quote>Farewell Lone Wolf. Kai and Ishir should be proud. You are indeed their most worthy champion</quote><ch.emdash/>she flashes you an impudent smile and in the blink of an eye she is gone.</p>
        <p>Congratulations, Grand Master, for you have braved the many terrors of the Plane of Darkness and emerged triumphant, your quest fulfilled. By denying the Dark God the power of the Moonstone you have won a great and lasting victory which will help keep your world secure. Your achievement will live forever in the legends of Sommerlund, and the tales that will be told of your valiant deeds will inspire future generations of Sommlending to follow the ways of the Kai.</p>
        <p>Your triumph over Naar paves the way for your accedence to rank of Kai Supreme Master. It also heralds the dawning of a new age, when new challenges will arise to test the courage and bravery of your New Order Kai. Under your paternal stewardship, the first of the New Order adventures is about to begin with the return of the fabled Moonstone to the remote and mysterious Isle of Lorn. If you wish to accept the challenge of the new era, the first exciting quest awaits you in the next <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> adventure which is entitled:</p>
