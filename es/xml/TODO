MAJOR:
-----

 - Fix illustration definitions for all the XML books 
    -> pdf versions have to define width in mm, not in pixels

    07 onwards, if this is not fixed the images in PDF are too large and 
    show chopped in the files.

 - Make a script to compare the XML structure (- text) with the original English books
   to compare differences and ensure that they are the same

- Synchronise content / layout with changes introduced in original English books. 

   Note: How can we simplify tracking editing changes in the English XML files?
   Maybe with po4a tools? (and manage the translation using gettext PO files?)

MINOR
-----

 - Spell check review of *all* books. 
     September 2013: Spell-checked #1, #2, #3, #13 and #14

 - Review use of <quote> sometimes there is no space after/before it

 - Use of quotes in the dialog of characters is not consistent. It is used in some
   books but not in others

 - Review illustrations in books to add 
    <instance class="html-compatible" 

 - Convert all files to UTF-8 to avoid encoding issues when generating PDFs

     If this is not fixed some accented characters (ยก) do not show properly in
     PDF output.

     Note: Fixed temporarily by using \usepackage[latin1]{inputenc}
     if we reconvert to UTF-8 we have to change that definition in l10n/i18n-pdf.xml

     Note2: If we use UTF-8 we have to change the script to be able to spell-check
     the docs properly. Ispell does not seem to support UTF-8 properly

DONE:
----

 - Add combat results table and random table inline

   NOTE: Only for crtable. Random table has been updated but since it is different
   per file it is not possible to include it
