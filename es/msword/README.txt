This directory contains the text content of the translations created by
fans of Joe Dever's Gamebooks. These translations have been created
in Microsoft Word format, and this directory contains the XML
conversion of those files.

These files do not follow the standard Gamebook format content as
the other XML files and are included here to keep the text content
in the Project Aon's repository before they are converted into 
standard Gamebook XML files.
