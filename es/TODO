ERRATA

- PDF files do not work OK:
     - missing definitions of image in PDF output (should be fixed when
       fixing [1] below)


TODO

[0] Document in the spanish XML files the (english) revision they were based
    on.  
    Note: Needed for version tracking and to implement the changes
    introduced in the english XML files o the Spanish

[1]- Update XML with updates introduced in English version

[2]- Review if all the gifs in 01hdlo, 02fsea, 03lcdk (/skins/standards) are
  needed. 
  NOTE: Probably only forward, title, toc and back are needed.

[3]- Do scans of the maps for all books and put them under the proper images
  NOTE: Images have been contributed for #1 - #5 based on the English
  files and using Spanish scans (which were black and white)

[4]- Change the XML files to use PNG instead of gif files. Use the
    html-compatible definition used in the english XML files.  
    Note:

  * This is related to [1], if [1] is DONE this should be done too

  * While this is not done the gbtoxhtml.pl will only publish PNG
  files but the HTML files will reference to GIF files too. Run this to convert:

for i in *.png; do name=`echo $i | sed -e 's/png/gif/'`; [ ! -e $name ] && convert $i $name; done

[5]- Change accented entities (<ch.XXXX>) to UTF-8 characters

     Note: 

      * Needed for spell checker, book #5 and #6 have been converted
      * If not properly encoded some characters will not be presented properly 
        when generating PDFs

[6]- LS#6: The weapons.gif needs to be remade, this book introduced the bow.

DONE
----
- Remove RCS revision logs from XML files

- PDF files: accented characteres do not show up properly (if using <ch.Xacute>) in
       titles but show up properly if using ISO-8859-1 encoding
