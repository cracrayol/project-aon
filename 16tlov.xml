     <p>You are Grand Master Lone Wolf, last of the Kai Lords of Sommerlund and sole survivor of a massacre that wiped out the First Order of your <ch.eacute/>lite warrior caste.</p>
     <p>It is the year MS 5077 and twenty-seven years have passed since your brave kinsmen perished at the hands of the Darklords of Helgedad. These champions of evil, who were sent forth by Naar, the King of the Darkness, to destroy the fertile world of Magnamund have themselves since been destroyed. You vowed to avenge the murder of the Kai and you kept your pledge, for it was you who brought about their downfall when alone you infiltrated their foul domain<ch.emdash/>the Darklands<ch.emdash/>and caused the destruction of their leader, Archlord Gnaag, and the seat of his power that was the infernal city of Helgedad.</p>
     <p>In the wake of their destruction, chaos befell the Darkland armies who, until then, had been poised to conquer all of Magnamund. Some factions which comprised this huge army, most notably the barbaric Drakkarim, began to fight with the others for control. This disorder quickly escalated into an all-out civil war, which allowed the Freeland armies of Magnamund time in which to recover and launch a counter-offensive. Skilfully their commanders exploited the chaos and secured a swift and total victory over an enemy far superior in numbers.</p>
     <p>For seven years now peace has reigned in Sommerlund. Under your direction, the once-ruined Monastery of the Kai has been thoroughly rebuilt and restored to its former glory, and the task of teaching a Second Order of Kai warriors the skills and proud traditions of your ancestors is also well under way. The new generation of Kai recruits, all of whom were born during the era of war against the Darklords, possess latent Kai skills and show exceptional promise. These skills will be nurtured and honed to perfection during their time at the monastery so that they may teach and inspire future generations, thereby ensuring the continued security of your homeland in future years.</p>
     <p>Your attainment of the rank of Kai Grand Master brought with it great rewards. Some, such as the restoration of the Kai and the undying gratitude of your fellow Sommlending, could have been anticipated. Yet there have also been rewards which you could not possibly have foreseen. The discovery that within you lay the potential to develop Kai Disciplines beyond those of the Magnakai, which, until now, were thought to be the ultimate that a Kai Master could aspire to, was truly a revelation. Your discovery has inspired you to set out upon a new and previously unknown path in search of the wisdom and power that no Kai Lord before you has ever possessed. In the name of your creator, the God Kai, and for the greater glory of Sommerlund and the Goddess Ishir, you have vowed to reach the very pinnacle of Kai perfection<ch.emdash/>to attain all of the Grand Master Disciplines and become the first Kai Supreme Master.</p>
     <p>With diligence and determination you set about the restoration of the Kai Monastery and organized the training of the Second Order recruits. Your efforts were soon rewarded and, within the space of two short years, the first raw recruits had graduated to become a cadre of gifted Kai Masters who, in turn, were able to commence the teaching of their skills to subsequent intakes of Kai novices. Readily the Kai Masters rose to their newfound responsibilities, leaving you free to devote more of your time to the pursuit and perfection of the Grand Master Disciplines. During this period you also received expert tutelage in the ways of magic from two of your most trusted friends and advisors: Guildmaster Banedon, leader of the Brotherhood of the Crystal Star, and Lord Rimoah, speaker for the High Council of the Elder Magi.</p>
     <p>In the deepest subterranean level of the monastery, a hundred feet below the Tower of the Sun, you ordered the excavation and construction of a special vault. In this magnificent chamber wrought of granite and gold you placed the seven Lorestones of Nyxator, the gems of Kai power which you had recovered during your quest for the Magnakai. It was here, bathed in the golden light of those radiant gems, that you spent countless hours in pursuit of perfection. Sometimes alone, sometimes in the company of your two able advisors<ch.emdash/>Banedon and Rimoah<ch.emdash/>you worked hard to develop your innate Grand Master Disciplines, and grasp the fundamental secrets of Left-handed and Old Kingdom magic. During this time you noticed many remarkable changes taking place within your body: you became physically and mentally stronger, your five primary senses sharpened beyond all that you had experienced before, and, perhaps most remarkably, your body began to age at a much slower rate. Now, for every five years that elapse you age but one year.</p>
     <p>At this time many changes were occurring beyond the borders of Sommerlund. In the regions to the northeast of Magador and the Maakengorge, the Elder Magi of Dessi and the Herbwardens of Bautar were working together in an effort to restore the dusty volcanic wasteland to its former fertile state. It was the first tentative step towards the reclamation of all the Darklands. However, their progress was painfully slow, and both parties were resigned to the fact that their efforts to undo the damage caused by the Darklords would take centuries to complete.</p>
     <p>Following the destruction of the Darklords of Helgedad, the Giaks, the most numerous of all Gnaag<ch.apos/>s troops, fled into the Darklands and sought refuge in the gigantic city-fortresses of Nadgazad, Aarnak, Gournen, Akagazad, and Kaag. Within each of these hellish strongholds, fierce fighting broke out as remnants of the Xaghash (lesser Darklords) and the Nadziranim (evil practitioners of Right-handed magic who once aided individual Darklord masters) fought for control. It is widely believed that by the time the Elder Magi and the Herbwardens reach the walls of these strongholds they will encounter no resistance; the occupants will have long since brought about their own extinction.</p>
     <p>Elsewhere, throughout Northern Magnamund, peace reigns victorious and the peoples of the Free Kingdoms rejoice in the knowledge that the age of the Darklords has finally come to an end. Readily men have exchanged their swords for hoes and their shields for ploughs, and now the only marching they do is along the ruts of their freshly furrowed fields. Few are the watchful eyes that scan the distant horizon in fear of what may appear, although there are still those who maintain their vigilance, for the agents of Naar come in many guises and there are those in Magnamund who wait quietly in the shadows for the chance to do his evil bidding.</p>
     <p>Already your newfound skills have been tested against Naar<ch.apos/>s agents and you have, on each such occasion, acquitted yourself admirably. But your continuing victories against his minions have enraged the Dark God, and rarely has his lust for vengeance been greater than it is at present. Recently, Lord Rimoah has counselled you to be extra vigilant, for he fears that Naar is getting ready to strike at Sommerlund anew. The Elder Magi have received warnings from President Kadharian of Magador that something strange is taking place in the north of his country, in the mountainous territory which borders upon the Maakengorge. Freak storms and unseasonal weather have swept this remote region, and the night skies over Lake Vorndarol have, for several weeks now, been illuminated by eerie, inexplicable lights.</p>
     <p>Lord Rimoah fears that Naar is plotting to revive Vashna, the greatest of all the Darklords, whose spirit is trapped deep within the fathomless reaches of the Maakengorge. It has remained there, in uneasy entombment, ever since the day the Darklord was defeated in battle by King Ulnar I of Sommerlund. Vashna<ch.apos/>s body, along with those of his loathsome troops, was hurled into the abyss, hopefully never to be seen again. Legend has it that the Darklord<ch.apos/>s body was destroyed but his spirit still lives on. He is said to be awaiting the day when he shall be made to rise, at the head of a vast army of undead warriors, and set loose to wreak his revenge upon Sommerlund and the house of Ulnar.</p>
     <p><quote>If it is Naar<ch.apos/>s intention to resurrect Vashna and his army from the depths of the Maakengorge,</quote> said an anxious Lord Rimoah, as you and he discussed the situation in the secure privacy of your vault below the Kai Monastery, <quote>then no free realm upon the face of Magnamund will be safe. It has always been Sommerlund<ch.apos/>s misfortune that Ulnar<ch.apos/>s victory over Vashna was never total. I have always feared that the legacy of the Maakengorge would one day awaken and confront us<ch.ellips/> and I fear, unless we act swiftly, that that day is about to dawn.</quote></p>
     <p>For several hours, you and your learned advisor deliberated what could be done to prevent such a catastrophe. You decided that the exact nature of the threat had first to be determined if you were to combat it effectively. You were confident that your Grand Master Disciplines would enable you to unravel this mystery quickly, and so you volunteered to journey to northern Magador and investigate the strange incidents at first hand. After all, there could be a perfectly innocent explanation for them.</p>
     <p><quote>Let us hope it is so, Grand Master,</quote> said Lord Rimoah, earnestly, <quote>but, nevertheless, do not forget what could confront you there. I shall pray to Kai and Ishir to watch over and guide you on the journey ahead, Lone Wolf, and bring you home, swiftly, safely and victoriously.</quote></p>

     <p>You keep a record of your adventure on the <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
     <p>For more than six years, ever since the demise of the Darklords of Helgedad, you have devoted yourself to developing further your fighting prowess<ch.emdash/><typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ><ch.emdash/>and physical stamina<ch.emdash/><typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ>. Before you begin your first Grand Master adventure you need to measure how effective your training has been. To do this take a pencil and, with your eyes closed, point with the blunt end of it on to the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a>. If you pick a 0 it counts as zero.</p>
     <p>The first number that you pick from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> in this way represents your <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ>. Add 25 to the number you picked and write the total in the <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> section of your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a> (i.e., if your pencil fell on the number 6 in the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> you would write in a <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> of 31). When you fight, your <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> will be pitted against that of your enemy. A high score in this section is therefore very desirable.</p>
     <p>The second number that you pick from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> represents your powers of <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ>. Add 30 to this number and write the total in the <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> section of your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a> (i.e., if your pencil fell on the number 7 on the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> you would have 37 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points).</p>
     <p>If you are wounded in combat you will lose <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points. If at any time your <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points fall to zero or below, you are dead and the adventure is over. Lost <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points can be regained during the course of the adventure, but your number of <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points can never rise above the number you have when you start an adventure.</p>
     <p>If you have successfully completed any of the previous adventures in the <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> series (Books 1<ch.endash/>15), you can carry your current scores of <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> and <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points over to Book 16. These scores may include Weaponmastery, Curing, and Psi-surge bonuses obtained upon completion of <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> Kai (Books 1<ch.endash/>5) or Magnakai (Books 6<ch.endash/>12) adventures.<a id="gamerulz-1" idref="gamerulz-1-foot" class="footnote" /> Only if you have completed these previous adventures will you benefit from the appropriate bonuses in the course of the Grand Master series. You may also carry over any Weapons and Backpack Items you had in your possession at the end of your last adventure, and these should be entered on your new Grand Master <a idref="action">Action Chart</a> (you are still limited to two Weapons, but you may now carry up to ten Backpack Items).</p>
     <p>However, only the following Special Items may be carried over from the <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> Kai (Books 1<ch.endash/>5) and Magnakai (Books 6<ch.endash/>12) series to the <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> Grand Master series (Books 13-onwards):<a id="gamerulz-2" idref="gamerulz-2-foot" class="footnote"/></p>

       <p>Now, through the pursuit of your new skills and the further development of your innate Kai abilities, you have set out upon a path of discovery that no other Kai Grand Master has ever attempted with success. Your determination to become the first Kai Supreme Master, by acquiring total proficiency in all twelve of the Grand Master Disciplines, is an awe-inspiring challenge. You will be venturing into the unknown, pushing back the boundaries of human limitation in the pursuit of greatness and the cause of Good. May the blessings of the Gods Kai and Ishir go with you as you begin your brave and noble quest.</p>
       <p>In the years following the demise of the Darklords you have reached the rank of Kai Grand Defender, which means that you have mastered <em>four</em> of the Grand Master Disciplines listed below. It is up to you to choose which four Disciplines these are. As all of the Grand Master Disciplines will be of use to you at some point during your adventure, pick your four skills with care. The correct use of a Grand Master Discipline at the right time could save your life.</p>
       <p>When you have chosen your four Disciplines, enter them in the Grand Master Disciplines section of your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>.</p>

      <p>There will be occasions during your adventure when you have to fight an enemy. The enemy<ch.apos/>s <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> and <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points are given in the text. Lone Wolf<ch.apos/>s aim in the combat is to kill the enemy by reducing his <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points to zero while losing as few <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points as possible himself.</p>
      <p>At the start of a combat, enter Lone Wolf<ch.apos/>s and the enemy<ch.apos/>s <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points in the appropriate boxes on the Combat Record section of your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>. The sequence for combat is as follows:</p>
      <ol class="paragraphed"> 
       <li><p>Add any extra points gained through your Grand Master Disciplines and Special Items to your current <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> total.</p></li>
       <li>
        <p>Subtract the <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> of your enemy from this total. The result is your Combat Ratio. Enter it on the <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
        <p>Example</p>
        <p>Lone Wolf (<typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> 27) is attacked by a pack of Doomwolves (<typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> 30). He is taken by surprise and is not given the opportunity of evading their attack. Lone Wolf has the Grand Master Discipline of Kai-surge to which the Doomwolves are not immune, so Lone Wolf adds 8 points to his <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ>, giving him a total <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> of 35.</p>
        <p>He subtracts the Doomwolf pack<ch.apos/>s <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> from his own, giving a Combat Ratio of +5. (35<ch.minus/>30 = +5). +5 is noted on the <a idref="action">Action Chart</a> as the Combat Ratio.</p>
       </li>
       <li><p><a id="stage3">When you have your Combat Ratio</a>, pick a number from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a>.</p></li>
       <li>
        <p>Turn to the <a idref="crtable">Combat Results Table</a>. Along the top of the chart are shown the Combat Ratio numbers. Find the number that is the same as your Combat Ratio and cross-reference it with the random number that you have picked (the random numbers appear on the side of the chart). You now have the number of <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points lost by both Lone Wolf and his enemy in this round of combat. (E represents points lost by the enemy; LW represents points lost by Lone Wolf.)</p>
        <p>Example</p>
        <p>The Combat Ratio between Lone Wolf and the Doomwolf Pack has been established as +5. If the number picked from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a> is a 2, then the result of the first round of combat is:</p>
        <ul>
         <li>Lone Wolf loses 3 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points (plus an additional 1 point for using Kai-surge).</li>
         <li>Doomwolf Pack loses 7 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points.</li>
        </ul>
       </li>
       <li><p>On the <a idref="action">Action Chart</a>, mark the changes in <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points to the participants in the combat.</p></li>
       <li><p>Unless otherwise instructed, or unless you have an option to evade, the next round of combat now starts.</p></li>
       <li><p>Repeat the sequence from <a idref="stage3">Stage 3.</a></p></li>
      </ol>

      <p>This process of combat continues until <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points of either the enemy or Lone Wolf are reduced to zero or below, at which point that combatant is declared dead. If Lone Wolf is dead, the adventure is over. If the enemy is dead, Lone Wolf proceeds but with his <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points possibly reduced.</p>

            <li><spell>Halt Missile</spell><ch.emdash/>This causes any projected or hurled missile (i.e. Arrows, axes, crossbow bolts etc.) which may pose an immediate threat to the life of a Sun Knight, to cease its flight and remain stationary in mid-air. The effect of the spell lasts for 2<ch.endash/>3 seconds, allowing the Sun Knight sufficient time to move away from its line of flight.

        <p>If you are a Grand Master who has reached the rank of Sun Lord (7 Disciplines), you will now benefit from improvements to the following Grand Master Disciplines:</p>
        <dl class="paragraphed">
          <dt>Grand Weaponmastery</dt>
           <dd><p>Sun Lords with this Discipline are able to cause the metal edge of any non-magical weapon to ignite and burn fiercely. When a weapon thus affected is used in combat, it inflicts an additional 1 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> point loss upon an enemy in every successful round of combat. This ability cannot be used with a wholly wooden weapon such as a quarterstaff.</p></dd>
          <dt>Assimilance</dt>
           <dd><p>Sun Lords who possess this skill are able to cause the outline of their bodies to become blurred and indistinct. By so doing, they can greatly increase their chances of avoiding magical and/or non-magical missiles directed at them.</p></dd>
          <dt>Grand Huntmastery</dt>
           <dd><p>Kai Sun Lords with this skill are able to see, with acute accuracy, light in the infrared spectrum, i.e. they can see complex patterns generated by heat in near or total darkness. They can also see light in the ultraviolet spectrum.</p></dd>
          <dt>Kai-surge</dt>
           <dd><p>Sun Lords who possess mastery of this Discipline are able to launch a Kai-blast<ch.emdash/>a pulse of intense psychic energy which is capable of affecting both psychically active and inactive enemies. This form of psychic attack is very effective, more so than a usual Kai-surge, Psi-surge, or Mindblast. It can cause an enemy to lose between 2 and 18 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points in one attack. A Kai Sun Lord using Kai-blast determines the damage inflicted on an enemy by picking two numbers from the <a idref="random">Random Number Table</a>. These numbers should be added together (a <quote>0</quote> = 1) and the resultant total equals the damage inflicted. However, use of a Kai-blast will reduce a Sun Lord<ch.apos/>s <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points total by 4. It cannot be used in conjunction with any other form of psychic attack.</p></dd>
          <dt>Telegnosis</dt>
           <dd><p>Sun Lords who possess this Discipline are able to alter their body weight in order to walk successfully upon different kinds of surfaces, e.g. water, mud, lava, and quicksand. Time duration and degree of surface difficulty increases as a Grand Master rises in rank.</p></dd>
          <dt>Magi-magic</dt>
           <dd>
            <p>Grand Masters who have reached the rank of Sun Lord are able to use the following battle-spells of the Elder Magi:</p>
            <ul>
             <li><spell>Penetrate</spell><ch.emdash/>This increases the penetrative energy of any Arrow or Arrow-like missile, launched by a Sun Lord.</li>
             <li><spell>Energy Grasp</spell><ch.emdash/>This spell enables a Sun Lord to discharge a powerful electrical force into anything he or she touches. It is similar in effect to the Brotherhood spell <spell>Lightning Hand</spell>, but differs in that it is easier to control and channel the resulting energy. It also requires the actual touching of an object or an enemy to effect the spell.</li>

     <p>Northern Magador, which borders upon the Maakengorge, is a notoriously wild and treacherous region. Be wary and on your guard at all times, for you can expect little help from the outlaws and fell creatures who dwell in this area.</p>
     <p>Some of the things that you will encounter during your mission will be of use to you in this and future <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> books, while others may be red herrings of no real value at all. If you discover any items, be selective in what you choose to keep.</p>
     <p>Pick your four Grand Master Disciplines with care, for a wise choice will enable any player to complete the mission, no matter how weak their initial <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ> and <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> scores may be. Successful completion of previous <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> adventures, although an advantage, is not essential for the completion of this Grand Master adventure.</p>
     <p>May the light of Kai and Ishir be your guide as you venture into the unknown.</p>

       <p>The hours leading up to your departure from the Kai Monastery are spent in the company of your able advisor, Lord Rimoah. Having discussed the mission at great length, you busy yourself now with the practical preparations for your long journey to Magador. He gives you a Scroll which contains a written invitation from President Kadharian to attend his senate to <quote>discuss trade between Sommerlund and Magador</quote>.<a id="sect1-1" idref="sect1-1-foot" class="footnote" /> It will provide a cover for you should the need arise to justify your journey. Also, in the interests of secrecy, you decide it best to discard your formal Kai robes in favour of less conspicuous garments, and you choose instead to wear the simple clothes of a guildsman<ch.emdash/>woollen breeches, leather tunic, and a cloak. Dressed thus, and aided by your innate Kai skills of Invisibility, you feel confident you will be able to travel the road to Helgor, the Magadorian capital, without drawing undue attention to yourself or your purpose.</p>
       <p>By horse, the journey to Helgor could be expected to take five weeks. Your initial thought had been to send word to your friend, Guildmaster Banedon, requesting that he allow you use of his magical skyship, <cite>Skyrider</cite>. However, on this occasion you will have to forego the speedy comfort of his wondrous craft, for Banedon is using it himself on a quest to the distant land of Bhanar in southern Magnamund, and he is not expected to return to Sommerlund before the year<ch.apos/>s end.</p>
       <p>Your second choice was also to prove unsuitable. Having resigned yourself to a long journey on horseback, you immediately sent an order to the monastery stables for your horse, Storm, to be saddled and made ready. This fine Slovarian stallion had been a gift to you from Elector Manatine of Palmyrion, in gratitude for the crucial part you played in the victory over the evil Cener Druids of Ruel. His strength, intelligence, and indomitable spirit had reminded you so much of your old Kai tutor<ch.emdash/>Storm Hawk<ch.emdash/>that you chose to name the horse Storm in his memory. But, as Rimoah quickly pointed out, such a magnificent horse would be sure to attract suspicion, especially if it was ridden by what appeared to be a humble guildsman. And so, albeit reluctantly, you had the stables prepare you another horse, a strong but less exceptional mount called Bracer.</p>

       <p>You have ridden to within five miles of the hamlet when you are forced to leave the trail and take cover. Ahead, you see a group of Vakovarian bandits encamped on a bridge which carries the trail across a fast-flowing stream. Rather than risk a confrontation, you follow this tributary of the River Storn a mile downstream until you happen upon a shallow bend where the water is fordable on horseback. You cross here, make a wide detour, and then return to the trail a mile beyond the Vakovarian<ch.apos/>s encampment.</p>
       <p>The trail gradually descends towards the burnt and derelict hovels of Vorn, clustered in squalid disarray around a greystone quay. Vakovarian bandits occupy the ruined hamlet and you decide it wise to leave the trail in case they have posted a lookout. A copse of stunted firs offers you a good hiding place for your horse. You tether him here, then gather some grasses and roots for him to eat while you are away scouting the hamlet.</p>
       <p>You have no difficulty entering Vorn unseen. From the first-floor ruins of a burnt-out inn on the outskirts of the hamlet you make a careful observation of the Vakovarians. They seem to be systematically looting the ruins and transporting their ill-gotten booty to a fishing boat which is moored at the quay. You are watching this boat closely when suddenly your concentration is broken by the sound of a yapping dog.</p>

The damp earth is steaming in the unusual heat of the morning sun, and the air crackles with an eerie residue of static electricity.</p>

       <p>You flick your heel against Bracer<ch.apos/>s flank and urge him towards the dingy street. Here, only a few houses show any light, and this through the knotholes and cracks of their bolted shutters. At length you come to a junction illuminated by a solitary street lantern. You are trying to decide which way to turn when your eye is distracted by something moving in the shadows. From out of a darkened doorway steps a pale-skinned woman wrapped in a black velvet cloak, edged with scarlet silk.</p>

       <p>You tell her you have no need for her company and turn your horse to leave, but suddenly you find yourself transfixed by the woman<ch.apos/>s eyes and unable to move. They seem unnaturally vibrant, as if filled with a flickering green fire; she is using magic in an attempt to charm you. Instinctively, you draw on your innate psychic Kai powers to try to dispel the charm, but her magic is unusually strong.</p>

       <p>You enter the open doorway, and the hubbub of laughter and conversation dies momentarily as all eyes turn to stare in your direction. They consider you for a few moments; then the chatter and noise begin anew and the eyes return to other matters. After descending a flight of steps to the sunken floor of the taproom, you make your way through the noisy crowd to the beer-soaked counter. A husky serving wench thuds a pewter tankard down on the bar before you and fills it with frothing ale.</p>

They are not a pretty crowd. The Crooked Sage is a tavern with an ill reputation, even in the brawling turmoil of Helgor<ch.apos/>s north quarter. The city guard never patrol here; a weekly donation to the guard captain guarantees that they are always somewhere else. Order, and what passes for law, is kept by Chegga, the owner of the inn, and his two brutish sons<ch.emdash/>Zhola and Gorgan.</p>
       <p>You finish your ale and the serving wench returns to refill your tankard.</p>
       <p><quote>That<ch.apos/>ll be one Gold Crown,</quote> she says, thrusting out a calloused palm. You place the crown on the bar and, as she goes to pick it up, you take hold of her wrist to prevent her from moving away.<a id="sect21-1" idref="sect21-1-foot" class="footnote" /></p>

       <p>Calmly you release her, take up your ale, and walk slowly towards the place where Smudd is seated. He is in the company of a giggling bar-girl and does not notice that you are standing beside him until you thump your tankard down on his table. The sound startles him and immediately he reaches for his sword.</p>
       <p>He has a desperate look about him which reminds you of a cornered rat. If you are to avoid a confrontation, you must do or say something to assuage his fear.</p>

        <p>The originally published edition of this book instructed you to add 5 points to your <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> score. We believe that our alteration to specify restoration instead of addition is closer to the intent of the author. The original led to several questions. Would this additional score be a permanent increase of your maximum <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ>? Permanent alterations of basic scores in the middle of an adventure are rare making this option unlikely. Nor does the context support this conclusion. Then would this addition only be for the duration of the combat similar to the bonus to <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ>? This makes the bonus useless. If you were to complete the combat with fewer than 5 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points remaining and then removed the bonus after the combat was over, you would be just as dead as without the bonus. Another proposal was that you should remove the bonus from your score only if it leaves your score above the normal maximum after the combat. Although reasonable, this probably wasn<ch.apos/>t the intent of the author since he did not specify this procedure. We have opted for the simplest, most straightforward choice: that this is just a restorative effect.</p>

You shoulder your Bow and draw your weapon, bringing your horse about with your knees as you get ready to face the beast. But the instant he sees the creature, he panics and rears up on his hind legs, neighing with fright, his hooves scrabbling frantically at the air. You bring him under control using your innate Kai skills, but in doing so your attention is diverted momentarily from the attacking beast as it moves in and swipes at you with its clawed paw.</p>

       <p>Your ascent into the foothills is slowed by the difficult terrain. Thousands of huge granite boulders litter the hillside, forcing the trail to zigzag constantly on its way towards a wooded peak, less than five kilometres distant. The weather turns bitterly cold as you make the climb and, although you are protected by your innate ability of Nexus, your horse is not so fortunate. It takes you over two hours to reach the wooded peak, but you are rewarded with a spectacular view of Lake Vorndarol.</p>
       <p>The descent from the peak is far easier. The trail is wide and less tortuous, and the peak itself protects you and your horse from the icy winds that are blowing in off the lake. You have gone a little over a kilometre when suddenly your Pathsmanship skills alert you to danger; you sense that there is an ambush ahead. You turn off the trail and dismount, leaving your horse tied to a boulder, while you scout the way ahead on foot. You draw your weapon and keep it to hand in case you should happen once more upon some skulking brigands.</p>

       <p>The fat drunkard can hardly believe his luck when you reach to your Belt Pouch and count out ten Gold Crowns into his grubby hand.</p>

       <p>With the drunkard<ch.apos/>s gleeful laughter echoing in your ears, you spur Bracer to a canter and enter this foul-smelling street. Clamped against the walls of the surrounding buildings are oil-soaked torches which serve to illuminate the signs of wine shops and taverns. They are crudely painted with emblems<ch.emdash/>a bloodied battle-axe, a winged horse, a watery sun rising from a broken skull. There is not one which resembles a crooked sage and you are beginning to suspect you have been duped, when suddenly you hear the sound of drunken revelry coming from a two-storey building at the end of the street. Its oaken doors hang open and the vivid orange glare of its roaring hearth spills invitingly into the dank night gloom. Although it has no painted emblem, you sense at once that you have come to the Crooked Sage Inn.</p>

       <p><quote>But how?</quote> you reply, bemused.</p>
       <p><quote>Simple! You must steal the Deathstaff and enter the Shadow Gate before her. Use the staff to destroy Cadak<ch.apos/>s crystal dais<ch.emdash/>this will close the gate and prevent the Demoness from entering Magnamund. But I warn you, Lone Wolf. You will have precious little time to accomplish this, so do not delay once you return to your world. You must destroy Cadak<ch.apos/>s dais as quickly as possible or Shamath will get through. She has great strength and power here, but on Magnamund her powers would make her invincible.</quote></p>
       <p>The young woman looks over her shoulder, as if she is being pursued by some invisible hunter. <quote>I wish I could help you more, Lone Wolf,</quote> she says, anxiously, <quote>but I have my own battle to fight. Be brave, Grand Master, but most of all<ch.emdash/>be swift!</quote></p>
       <p>And with these words she begins to fade before your eyes. The moment she vanishes completely, the cavern echoes to a deafening roar. It is the angry cry of Shamath. She has seen you!</p>

       <p>You awake shortly after dawn to the smell of freshly-brewed jala. Fyrad has already risen and is busy preparing breakfast. He hands you a steaming mug and you look out over the damp hillside, contemplating the quest whilst sipping this delicious beverage.</p>
       <p>After breakfast, Fyrad tells you of a pass which leads directly to the east shore; then he gathers his equipment and furs and loads them on to his mule. He is tired of dodging brigands and storms and has decided to strike camp and abandon his hunt in the mountains. You bid each other good luck before saying your final farewells. On leaving the cave, you turn to the east and Fyrad to the south.</p>
       <p>The hunter<ch.apos/>s directions are accurate and useful. You find the pass and by noon you have reached a chalky plateau on the far side, which is covered with dense scrub. Small groups of ragged-looking birds are perched on this foliage, feeding on its brightly coloured blooms.

You have noticed that the night wind has gradually been getting warmer and, as you reach the copse, a few drops of rain begin to spatter the shoulders of your cloak. Within minutes this gentle shower is transformed into a torrential downpour. Suddenly, thunder booms overhead and forks of white lightning streak down to explode among the surrounding trees, setting them on fire. Fearful of the danger, you peer through the wall of rain in search of safer shelter.</p>

       <p>You make the jump look effortless as you glide through the air and make a perfect landing on the opposite roof. For a moment the black-clad archer halts beside a tall chimney stack and turns around to look at you. He is clearly worried by how efficiently you are pursuing him. Then, three other shadowy figures emerge from behind the stack and stand at his shoulder. Silently they stare at you for a few moments before one of their number raises his hand and hurls a glassy sphere in your direction.</p>
       <p>The sphere shatters at your feet and, in an instant, your legs are engulfed by a writhing mass of magical vines. By the time you have freed yourself, you discover that the assassin and his confederates are nowhere to be seen. Cautiously, you approach the chimney stack where you find, lying at its base, a palm-sized coin of black metal engraved with runes. You pick up this disc and slip it into the pocket of your tunic. (Record this Runic Disc on your <a idref="action">Action Chart</a> as a Special Item. You must discard an item in its favour if you already carry the maximum number permissible.)</p>
       <p>Having lost sight of the four shadowy figures, you decide now to call off the chase. Wearily you make your way down from the roof and retrace your steps back to the stables of the Crooked Sage in order to collect your horse.</p>

Through the downpour, you can see that the acolytes are slowly returning. They are anxious for the safety of their leader and hungry for the successful summoning of their banished lord.</p>
       <p>Despite the chill, you tighten your grip on the icy cold Deathstaff and climb the tiers to the top of the dais. You sense that the crystal dais commands the opening and closing of the Shadow Gate, and you know you must try to close the gate before Shamath appears.

       <p>Night has thickened the blanket of mist which lines the narrow streets and alleys of Helgor. Guided by your Kai instincts, you set off northwards, but soon you have cause to regret not having thought of asking Kadharian for directions to the Crooked Sage Inn. Helgor is an old city and its chaotic streets follow no logical plan. After several wrong turns you come upon a square where the vanes of a rotting signpost point to three exits. Slumped at its base there sits a dishevelled fat man with a yellow streaked beard, who is gulping mouthfuls of cheap ale from a filthy stone pitcher. You attempt to use your Kai Pathsmanship skill to read the signpost but with no success<ch.emdash/>it is completely illegible.</p>

       <p>You are nearing the middle of the river when your acute hearing detects the cawing of birds in the far distance. At first you dismiss the sounds, thinking they are probably birds of prey feeding somewhere high in the mountains, but when the cawing rapidly grows louder you look upwards to try to detect where it is coming from. You do not have to look very far.</p>
       <p>Three hundred metres above you, a flock of ugly black birds are cawing excitedly as they ride a thermal air current. You recognize them to be Durncrag Scavengers, cruel predators native only to these mountains. Then, with an awful suddenness, they come diving towards you, screeching like demons as they prepare to strike with beak and claw.</p>

        <p>The originally published edition of this book instructed you to add 5 points to your <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> score. We believe that our alteration to specify restoration instead of addition is closer to the intent of the author. The original led to several questions. Would this additional score be a permanent increase of your maximum <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ>? Permanent alterations of basic scores in the middle of an adventure are rare making this option unlikely. Nor does the context support this conclusion. Then would this addition only be for the duration of the combat similar to the bonus to <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ>? This makes the bonus useless. If you were to complete the combat with fewer than 5 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points remaining and then removed the bonus after the combat was over, you would be just as dead as without the bonus. Another proposal was that you should remove the bonus from your score only if it leaves your score above the normal maximum after the combat. Although reasonable, this probably wasn<ch.apos/>t the intent of the author since he did not specify this procedure. We have opted for the simplest, most straightforward choice: that this is just a restorative effect.</p>

       <p>The journey to Helgor takes you south to the City-state of Casiorn, then west to the Lyrisian capital of Varetta<ch.emdash/>a road you once travelled several years ago during your Magnakai quest. In the main, your ride is peaceably uneventful. By choice you keep to yourself and avoid staying too long in any one place. It is not until you reach Vakovar that the uncertain politics of this region give rise for concern. This squalid, lawless city is home to some of the Stornlands<ch.apos/> most notorious criminals and robber-barons. It is common knowledge that travellers who value their wealth and health wisely avoid Vakovar whenever possible. Forewarned by these rumours you choose not to dwell here, but ride swiftly through the city and press on to Helgor. Yet while you are within the city walls of Vakovar no less than a dozen separate attempts are made to relieve you of your money pouch and horse. There are no witnesses to these attacks, which is just as well, for when you ride out of Vakovar you leave a score of dead robbers littering the cobblestones.</p>
       <p>It is early evening when you eventually crest a hill and catch your first disappointing glimpse of Helgor. It is a damp and unwholesome-looking city, ringed by a rampart of mouldering rubble, the remains of a curtain wall which was destroyed during the war against the Darklords. Through the many gaps in this rampart you can see the thick fog that swirls through Helgor<ch.apos/>s brick streets and crooked, filthy alleys. At first sight it seems that the Magadorian capital is little more than a beggar-city, a vast hotchpotch of slums and hovels, but as you ride nearer you notice several grand towers piercing the rolling grey mist.</p>

       <p>The main approach to Helgor is patrolled by presidential guards, heavily armed with crossbows and spears, who are checking everyone attempting to enter by road. They are dressed in flamboyant tunics of green, scarlet, and black calf hide, which seem too lavish for the garrison of such a squalid city. When asked your business, you show them the scroll given to you by Rimoah. They are impressed by the invitation and insist that an armed escort be provided to take you directly to the President<ch.apos/>s palace. After your experience at Vakovar you welcome their offer.</p>
       <p>Despite the overwhelming squalor of Helgor<ch.apos/>s dingy tenements and streets, you were expecting the President<ch.apos/>s palace to be the exception. To your disappointment, it turns out to be little more than a fortified chateau situated at the centre of the city, atop a hill known as the Vanagrom Knoll. You are welcomed into the palace<ch.apos/>s senate hall by an official called Stepona, a dour man who looks older than his thirty years. He sees to it that your horse is stabled, and that you are given refreshments while you await your audience with the President. An hour passes before the doors to the senate hall swing open and, without formal announcement, in strides President Kadharian of Magador.</p>

        <p>The originally published edition of this book instructed you to add 5 points to your <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> score. We believe that our alteration to specify restoration instead of addition is closer to the intent of the author. The original led to several questions. Would this additional score be a permanent increase of your maximum <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ>? Permanent alterations of basic scores in the middle of an adventure are rare making this option unlikely. Nor does the context support this conclusion. Then would this addition only be for the duration of the combat similar to the bonus to <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ>? This makes the bonus useless. If you were to complete the combat with fewer than 5 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points remaining and then removed the bonus after the combat was over, you would be just as dead as without the bonus. Another proposal was that you should remove the bonus from your score only if it leaves your score above the normal maximum after the combat. Although reasonable, this probably wasn<ch.apos/>t the intent of the author since he did not specify this procedure.

Screaming acolytes tumble past and disappear into its maw as you desperately hang on to the dais to stop yourself from being sucked to your death. But your resistance is futile. With a callous flick of her wrist, the Demoness Shamath consigns you to your doom.</p>

        <p>The originally published edition of this book instructed you to add 5 points to your <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> score. We believe that our alteration to specify restoration instead of addition is closer to the intent of the author. The original led to several questions. Would this additional score be a permanent increase of your maximum <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ>? Permanent alterations of basic scores in the middle of an adventure are rare making this option unlikely. Nor does the context support this conclusion. Then would this addition only be for the duration of the combat similar to the bonus to <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ>? This makes the bonus useless. If you were to complete the combat with fewer than 5 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points remaining and then removed the bonus after the combat was over, you would be just as dead as without the bonus. Another proposal was that you should remove the bonus from your score only if it leaves your score above the normal maximum after the combat. Although reasonable, this probably wasn<ch.apos/>t the intent of the author since he did not specify this procedure. We have opted for the simplest, most straightforward choice: that this is just a restorative effect.</p>

       <p>Throughout the afternoon, the rocky trail descends through an unlovely landscape of shale hills and crags topped with thorny brambles. It is difficult terrain but your ride passes without incident. Shortly before dusk, you come to the top of a ridge and catch your first glimpse of the River Storn and the snow-capped peaks of the southern Durncrags beyond. The elation of having come this far is sobered when you see that the distant sky is changing rapidly, and only a slender streak of light fringes the horizon. A storm is closing in.</p>
       <p>As you make the long, gradual descent towards the river, the air becomes humid and dark clouds appear overhead. The turmoil of moisture quickly charges the atmosphere. Lightning flashes without warning from the clouds to the earth and arcs skyward again, its energy echoing in a slow roll of thunder. Then the heavens open and a deluge of rain saturates the land. You calm your startled horse and urge him through the pouring rain, praying all the while that you will be able to find shelter before night closes in.</p>
       <p>You are within a mile of the river when the darkness is almost complete. Yet, aided by your keen vision, you are able to make out two places that can offer some degree of shelter from the storm. The first is a cone-shaped stone hut, perched near the river<ch.apos/>s edge; the second is a rocky hollow close to the trail.</p>

When it is just a few hundred metres from the shore, a volley of lightning bolts comes hurtling from its core to explode against the quayside wall with devastating effect. Several brigands are incinerated where they stand, leaving nothing but glowing piles of ash to mark their passing. Then, suddenly, a massive longboat emerges from the wall of fog and comes speeding towards the quay. Glowing bolts of energy dart from its prow to explode upon the deck of the Vakovarian ship. One of these bolts passes high between the masts and arcs through the air towards the quay. You watch with mounting horror as it comes speeding directly towards you.</p>

       <p>The crossing is laborious and tiring (lose 2 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points), but at length you reach the far side of the river and disembark safely.

       <p>You collect your horse and accompany Fyrad to his camp which is hidden in a hill cave. The hunter has made this bare rock hollow surprisingly comfortable with a fire, a straw mattress, and a rock-lined food store dug into its earthen floor. The two corvayl pelts he spoke of are hanging on wooden frames near the smouldering embers of the fire, and his mule, which he calls <quote>Izzy</quote>, is dozing at the rear of the cave.</p>

       <p>As you enter, a hawk swoops down from the roof and lands on Fyrad<ch.apos/>s arm. He produces a strip of dried meat from his pocket and the hawk takes it back to his perch to consume at his leisure.</p>
       <p><quote>Fine bird, that <ch.apos/>un,</quote> he says, fondly. <quote>He<ch.apos/>s led me to some rich quarry over the years.</quote></p>
       <p>Over a meal of rabbit and wild berries, you ask Fyrad what he knows about the Acolytes of Vashna and the Maakengorge. He says he has seen their camp on the east shore of the lake but, like the infamous gorge, only from a distance. His main cause for concern has been the storms and the Vakovarian bandits. If he did not have a hungry family and debts to meet in Karkaste, he would have packed up and gone home a month ago.</p>
       <p>After your delicious meal, you attend to your horse before settling down for the night. You offer to share the watch but Fyrad says this will not be necessary.</p>

You command them to guard the cave mouth; then you settle down to rest, confident in the knowledge that they will wake you at the first sign of trouble.</p>

       <p>You stagger to your feet and shake your head to clear your blurred vision. The first thing you see when your sight returns to normal is the attacking longboat as it collides with the Vakovarian ship. With a deafening screech of twisting metal and shearing timbers, it shudders along the length of the starboard side, sending the brigands who are aboard cartwheeling helplessly across the deck. Grappling lines are cast and boarding planks lowered, and before the Vakovarians can recover, a screaming horde of red-robed acolytes are amongst them, slaying all without quarter.</p>
       <p>On the quayside the Vakovarians are gripped by panic. Many flee to the ruins, but there is a core of battle-hardened ex-mercenaries who band together and attempt a counterattack. Bloody fighting rages along the quayside as the acolytes try to recapture the three who are tied to the stone obelisk. The prisoners are eventually saved by a trio of Acolyte Elders, each of whom is armed with a glowing wand that discharges an incinerating blast of energy against any brigand foolish enough to stand in their way. The Elders retreat to the long boat with the freed prisoners, but the fighting has started to spread beyond the quay. There is a sudden noise to your left, and when you turn to face it, you see two Acolytes of Vashna racing along the street towards you with bloodied swords held ready to strike you down.</p>

Another storm is brewing; the eastern sky is alive with electrical activity and thunder booms beyond the horizon. Your ears pop as the air pressure fluctuates wildly and the howl of the wind seems to be growing ever louder. Then you notice something strange. Your torch does not seem to be affected by the storm; it is burning as smoothly as if you were in an enclosed room. You glance over your shoulder and see that the same is true of every other torch.

       <p>Two kilometres from the settlement you pass a group of acolyte youths, all in their early teens, who are calling encouragement, chanting, and waving the line onwards. Then the path bends and you see a wayside altar and a large marble trough filled with stagnant green water. As they file past, every acolyte dips his right hand into the trough and touches it to his heart.</p>

       <p>Your Kai Mastery informs you that this creature is telling the truth. You also sense that she is not human; she is a supernatural creature, not of your world or this.

Bloodied in combat, they stand off just long enough for you to urge your horse to a gallop and get away along the shore. With the help of your Kai Mastery, he crosses the difficult terrain with agility, despite his fatigue, and soon reaches firmer ground where he is able to increase his pace and escape from the howling pack.</p>

Hopeful that it is Bracer, escaped from the brigands and come to find you, you push through the densely-packed trees until you stumble upon a clearing.

       <p>They are unguarded and you cannot sense their owners close by, but even so you take every care not to startle them. Silently you untether one of the stallions and lead him away from the rest of the horses, along a trail which is covered with fresh tracks, and soon you come to a wider trail which winds away to the north.

       <p>You intensify your vision and focus upon the figure who commands the crystal dais. Shock freezes your spine when you recognize at once the face and flowing platinum hair of Arch Druid Cadak, ruler of Mogaruith, the usurper lord of Kaag. He has grown strong since your last fateful encounter, and now it seems that he is poised to fulfil the Dark God Naar<ch.apos/>s lust for vengeance by releasing Vashna and his hordes from the depths of the Maakengorge.</p>
       <p>You take your place among the throng who are kneeling before the dais, and hear Cadak<ch.apos/>s voice ring out above the howling storm.</p>
       <p><quote>I summon forth from the Vortex of the Planes the Deliverer of Vashna, Mighty Lord of Darkness, Prince of the Legions of the Restless Dead. Come to us. Come to us now and fulfil our destiny. We, the worthy, now prove our faith in the undying power of Vashna.</quote></p>
       <p>With these words, the acolytes utter a chilling cry of affirmation and rise to their feet. By rank they follow the Elders in single file towards a smaller, shimmering metallic arch which stands to one side of the crystal dais, almost obscured by the glare of the larger one. One by one they file through this archway, under the watchful gaze of Cadak, and then return to their places where they kneel and pray.</p>
       <p>As you approach the smaller arch, you sense a curtain of power drawn across it. Anxiously you pray to the Gods Kai and Ishir to protect you as you prepare to pass through this invisible barrier.</p>

Immediately you are assailed by the greasy stench of the furs which fill this emporium. They hang in rows from ornate brass hooks driven into the wooden walls and ceiling rafters, sorted by size and type. Three young men, all strikingly similar in looks, are busy trimming wolf pelts at a work bench. Behind the counter stands a grey-haired old woman with a straight back and clear, milky-white skin.

        <p>The originally published edition of this book instructed you to add 5 points to your <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> score. We believe that our alteration to specify restoration instead of addition is closer to the intent of the author. The original led to several questions. Would this additional score be a permanent increase of your maximum <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ>? Permanent alterations of basic scores in the middle of an adventure are rare making this option unlikely. Nor does the context support this conclusion. Then would this addition only be for the duration of the combat similar to the bonus to <typ class="attribute">COMBAT SKILL</typ>? This makes the bonus useless. If you were to complete the combat with fewer than 5 <typ class="attribute">ENDURANCE</typ> points remaining and then removed the bonus after the combat was over, you would be just as dead as without the bonus. Another proposal was that you should remove the bonus from your score only if it leaves your score above the normal maximum after the combat. Although reasonable, this probably wasn<ch.apos/>t the intent of the author since he did not specify this procedure. We have opted for the simplest, most straightforward choice: that this is just a restorative effect.</p>

Her slimy flanks are studded with a multitude of tiny tendrils, and her head is equipped with a sphincter-like maw which drips loathsome green saliva. She slithers closer and, in the half-light, you catch sight of her ghastly face. It is like that of an infant, wholly black, save for the eyes which are aglow with a hellish red fire.</p>
       <p>The worm-thing rears up and, as the head sweeps past your eyes a second time, you suddenly recognize the facial features and a paralysing blast of psychic shock rips through your mind. It has the face of your long-dead brother Jen.</p>

There is a moment of dreadful silence when even the storm and the rain abate; then the air shakes with a terrific implosion as the great shimmering arch collapses inwards and slowly disintegrates. Sparkling sheets of energy buckle and fuse as segments of the arch fall to the ground, crushing everything beneath, rock and man. For an instant you catch a glimpse of a huge booted foot stepping through a silvery sheet of energy and you tremble at the thought of what will happen next, for you recognize only too well to whom the foot belongs.

The distant horizon is streaked with myriad colours and the dry air crackles with electricity, a legacy of last night<ch.apos/>s violent storm.

       <p>An expanse of dead land, littered with cracked and shattered rocks, slopes down to the edge of an immense chasm that stretches more than a kilometre from rim to rim. It is the Maakengorge. Hordes of screeching Vortexi ride a violent electrical storm which rages in the clouds above this vast abyss, and the earth shudders in echoing response to the booming thunder. Near the rim of the chasm there stands a towering arch, hewn of stone, that shimmers with such a supernatural brilliance that you cannot fully focus upon it. Peering closer you see before the arch an elaborate, multi-tiered dais constructed entirely of crystal. Around it kneel hundreds of acolytes who are chanting devoutly. Their dreary voices add to the dreadful noise.</p>

It is as if he is manipulating the storm as a conductor would an orchestra. With a grand sweep of his arms he calms the turbulent sky; then he turns to face his kneeling congregation.</p>

Inside, you discover a group of gamblers standing at a circular table with playing cards in their hands. They have all risen from their seats to look at something on the far side of the room. When you follow their gaze, you see it is the archer; he is climbing through an open window on to a balcony outside.</p>

       <p>You leave the ancient settlement and continue your ride along the sun-baked river trail. As dusk approaches, you keep a weather eye open for the signs of a storm. Clouds are rapidly forming over the mountains to the east, and the metallic smell of ozone is strong on the evening breeze.</p>
       <p>In the middle distance you see a large herd of Vythaz. These timid, goat-like mountain animals are rarely seen at this time of the year, yet here are more than two hundred of them drinking at the river<ch.apos/>s edge. You sense that they are nervous and confused; the eerie weather has disrupted their natural migratory instincts and they have descended to the river a season earlier than is usual.</p>
       <p>Suddenly, there is a flash of lightning and a mighty clap of thunder explodes in the sky overhead. The herd scatter in all directions, terrified by the noise. Then an incredible ball of light shoots down from the heavens and hits the trail, scattering stones like shrapnel and leaving a huge, smoking crater in its wake. You pull your horse off the trail and run with the fleeing Vythaz herd as more of the lightning balls streak down from the stormy sky.</p>

       <p>The blazing cavern walls grow dim, and shimmering waves of the crimson light begin to sweep across the floor towards the crystal dais. Suddenly Shamath reappears in her female form at the base of the dais. In front of her booted legs there stand a dozen powerful warriors, armoured and helmeted as if for war, but their stern faces have no eyes and their mouths have no lips. Behind her, a score of new attendants emerge from the shadows carrying large pieces of shiny black armour. She begins to strap this armour to her limbs and, by the sluggishness of her movements, you can tell that she must have been weakened by your earlier conflict.</p>

       <p>With a single word she commands the warriors to attack you. They raise their short swords and come marching slowly forwards, their movements stiff and machine-like. Beyond their advancing line you catch sight of the Deathstaff still lying near the base of the dais, and a bold plan springs to mind. If you could evade the oncoming line of automatons, you could reach the dais. Then you would be able to take the Deathstaff and enter the Shadow Gate before Shamath recovers her strength.</p>

       <p>Most of the bandit activity appears to be going on around the quay. In order to get a better view, you leave the inn and make your way down through the ruins towards the lake, taking care to avoid those Vakovarians who are out looting. The burnt-out shell of a meeting hall offers you an unobstructed view of the quay and its flagstoned square. You hide here, invisible among the charred roof timbers, and watch as a curious scene unfolds on the quayside.</p>

       <p>In the cold light of dawn you see that the River Storn is too deep and fast-flowing to be fordable at this point. The trail follows the river downstream so you decide to follow it in the hope of finding somewhere to cross. Two kilometres later, you happen upon such a place.</p>
       <p>At a point where the river slows and widens, you find a crude rope ferry has been erected. It comprises two rafts attached to two long lengths of rope which are suspended above the river. A crossing can be achieved by boarding a raft and pulling on its guide rope to haul it across to the opposite bank.</p>

He was an agent of the Elder Magi based in the Darklands who, seven years earlier, helped you to enter the dread city of Helgedad and bring about the downfall of the Darklords. Now he is known by a different name<ch.emdash/>President Kadharian of Magador.</p>

       <p>The President is amused by your expression of surprise and offers an explanation of how he came to be leader of this rough republic. After the fall of Helgedad, the Elder Magi arranged for his safe passage to the Stornlands where he was granted a command in the army of Lyris. He distinguished himself in battle and later, once the remains of the Darkland armies had been vanquished, he returned to his native Magador and led an uprising against King Vanagrom VI, who had long been a puppet of the Darklords. The revolt ended with the King<ch.apos/>s death and the abolition of the monarchy. Magador became a republic and the Slavemaster, whose given name was Kadharian, became its first elected leader.</p>

Its walls of ancient obsidian rise to a high-arched roof where hangs a circle of stalactites<ch.emdash/>twelve huge luminescent spears of lime-green stone. Bathed in their pulsating glow is a many-tiered crystal dais, identical to the one on which Arch Druid Cadak stood before the great shimmering archway at the edge of the Maakengorge. To the right of this dais you see a dark tunnel. The entrance appears like a black semicircular shadow upon the cavern wall.</p>
       <p>Standing upon the uppermost tier of the dais is a creature which both mesmerizes and repulses you. It has the semblance of a human female, yet she stands more than seven metres tall. She is strikingly beautiful but you sense at once that she is also wholly evil. Her skin has a deathly, corpse-like pallor and she is clad in a flowing black costume which trails thin wisps of smoke. Cloaked figures scurry around the lower tiers of the dais, carrying out their mistress<ch.apos/>s commands and attending to her every whim. If they fail or displease her she crushes them like lowly insects in her elegant, deadly hands.</p>
       <p>You watch in silent fascination as this demonic creature makes preparations, as if for a long journey. Then, in a flash of a sudden realization, you know her purpose. She is getting ready to enter the tunnel, a tunnel which will transport her to the archway at the edge of the Maakengorge. She is the deliverer of Vashna of whom Cadak spoke, the one who will raise the spirit of Lord Vashna from the chasm of doom!</p>

       <p>The Vakovarians search the inn thoroughly. They fail to find you on their first sweep, but when they return to search again, one of them discovers your hiding place when he accidentally treads on your foot.</p>
       <p>You react quickly and with fatal effect. A blow to the throat silences the brigand for good and prevents him from ever warning his confederates that you are here. They do not notice that he is missing and they leave the inn to go elsewhere. By the time they realize they are one man short, you have searched and hidden his body and made good your escape from the inn.</p>
       <p>Among the items you discover on the brigand are the following:</p>
       <ul>
        <li>Bow</li>
        <li>Quiver with 4 Arrows</li>
        <li>Dagger</li>

        <li>13 Gold Crowns</li>
        <li>Rope</li>
        <li>Small Sack</li>
       </ul>
       <p>After leaving the inn, you make your way down through the ruins towards the lake, taking care to avoid other Vakovarians who are out looting. The burnt-out shell of a meeting hall offers you an unobstructed view of the quay and its flagstoned square. You hide here, invisible among the charred roof timbers, and watch as a curious scene unfolds on the quayside.</p>

       <p>You ride slowly through the clammy fog which carpets the cobblestones of this ill-smelling lane. Clamped against the walls of the surrounding buildings are oil-soaked torches which serve to illuminate the signs of wine shops and taverns. They are crudely painted with emblems<ch.emdash/>a bloodied battle-axe, a winged horse, a watery sun rising from a broken skull. There is not one that resembles a crooked sage and you are beginning to lose heart when suddenly you hear the sound of drunken revelry coming from a two-storey building at the end of the street. Its oaken doors hang open and the vivid orange glare of its roaring hearth spills invitingly into the dank night gloom. Although it has no painted emblem, you sense at once that you have at last found the Crooked Sage Inn.</p>

As your hand closes upon it, a fearful roar erupts from the bushes on the other side of the trail.

You leave the grove at first light and follow the rushing stream until you happen upon a shallow bend where the water is fordable on horseback. You cross here, make a wide detour, and then return to the trail a mile beyond the Vakovarian<ch.apos/>s encampment.</p>
       <p>The trail gradually descends towards the burnt and derelict hovels of Vorn, clustered in squalid disarray around a greystone quay. Vakovarian bandits occupy the ruined hamlet and you decide it wise to leave the trail in case they have posted a lookout. A copse of stunted firs offers you a good hiding place for your horse. You tether him here, then gather some grasses and roots for him to eat while you are away scouting the hamlet.</p>
       <p>You have no difficulty entering Vorn unseen. From the first-floor ruins of a burnt-out inn on the outskirts of the hamlet you make a careful observation of the Vakovarians. They seem to be systematically looting the ruins and transporting their ill-gotten booty to a fishing boat which is moored at the quay. You are watching this boat closely when suddenly your concentration is broken by the sound of a yapping dog.</p>
